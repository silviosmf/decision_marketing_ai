# AI in the Decision-Making Marketing: Considerations and Strategic Applications in Organizational Contexts
The script was constructed by defining a detailed prompt template that instructs the model on how to categorize each abstract based on predefined criteria for strategic, tactical, operational, out-of-scope, or not identified levels. 

The prompt template provides clear examples and definitions for each category, ensuring the model's output is consistent and accurate. The script also includes a function to process abstracts iteratively, applying the GPT-4o-mini model and saving the results in CSV files for further analysis. 

By structuring the model's responses in a JSON format with specified columns, the script facilitates easy interpretation of the classification results.

Finally, we created some statistical outputs with data visualizations and graphs using the Seaborn library, which helped us better understand the distribution and trends within the classified data.
