"Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to be intelligent, most importantly using Machine Learning (ML) in which machines are trained to be able to make better decisions and predictions. In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",Alazzam B.A.; Alkhatib M.; Shaalan K.,Not identified,10.18576/isl/120437,Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning,50.0,,20,5,Natural Sciences Publishing,"The abstract discusses the development and comparison of chatbot systems, particularly focusing on Arabic and English languages, but it does not clearly fit into strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing.

"Few key skills among many that are needed in the 21st century are critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, meta cognitive skills, technology literacy and decision making under uncertainty. With the emergence of ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools, there is a dire need for a distinctive way of learning and application of learning to ensure learning effectiveness. Mere content is no longer the most important factor to learn these skills but. what is needed is the ability to retrieve material learnt, in the context of application. For the learner to be able to apply the critical thinking levels and higher learning levels of Blooms taxonomy, the basic first level of remembering forms the basic foundation, particularly when the students are from first generation educated families or with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. However, when students cram for the exams, they generally get an ‘illusion of learning’, where they think they know, but in reality often they may not be able to recall what they crammed when they need it later. This is a case of inefficient investment of time and effort in learning for the student. For the teacher, it slows down the teaching process and opportunity to engage in higher order thinking level applications. Addressing the frustrations of both teacher and students, the authors applied the concept of Retrieval method for MBA I year for Marketing Management course during a semester and a survey was conducted at the end of the semester to understand the perception of students on effectiveness of Retrieval techniques. The results supported that retrieval techniques were effective in supporting the student learning. © 2023 JEET.",Vishnu Vandana V.; Rao A.M.,Not identified,10.16920/jeet/2024/v37is2/24102,Blooms Taxonomy; Learning intervention; Retention technique; Retrieval Technique,60.0,,10,5,Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology,"The abstract discusses educational strategies and retrieval methods in learning, which do not directly fit into the categories of strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decisions, nor are they out of scope since they relate to the learning process rather than marketing applications.",scopus-ai,10,15,Retrieval method as a learning intervention for long term retention and creative thinking skills,2024
"In the past decades, researchers in various areas of social and cognitive psychology have developed dual process theories of information processing. Although these theories differ on a variety of dimensions, including domains of application and specific definitions, they all share the basic assumption that two different modes of information processing operate in making judgments, decisions as well as in solving problems. In essence, the common distinction in dual process modes is between a fast, associative information process mode with low effort heuristics, and a slow, rule-based mode with high effort systematic process. On the basis of a brief theoretical development introduction, we illustrate how the dual process theory is manifested in various disciplines. Table 1 summarizes the different representations of dual process, including heuristic vs. systematic; peripheral route vs. central route; associative access vs. attitude construct; categorization vs. individuation; automatic contextual influences vs. correction; experiential vs. rational; impulsive vs. reflective; implicit vs. explicit. Later on, we discuss how different types of information processing modes are determined and what the main factors that may significantly influence information processing adoption. Several determinants are identified froma review of the extant literature; for instance, the involvement would be an influential factor that affects what type of information processing mode adopted. Specifically, if an information processor does not have a high level of involvement, it would be more likely of him / her to adopt a heuristic mode comparing with a systematic mode. Similarly, if a consumer does not in a focal status of high motivation, comparing with the one with a high level of motivation, he/ she would be more likely to adopt a heuristic mode. The related factors that are generally discussed in previous studied are shown in Table 2. Although we may learn that these factors as listed are playing significant roles in influencing what type of information processing mode adopted, little has been discussed in prior research in relation to the possible interaction effects that would play a role. In particular, we could conjecture that a higher level of motivation of information processor would be more likely to adopt systematic information processing mode, but what would be happen if the information processor does not have a higher level of ability to process the information in order to make a judgment or decision? Will the information processor adopt systematic mode or heuristic mode? Moreover, when we try to take the risk as an important factor into consideration, if the decision context is with a high risk, will the information processor adopt systematic processing mode even if he/ she does not have the ability to process related information? Whether the processor would adopt heuristic processing mode when he / she does not have the ability to process? This calls for future research to further explore more rich findings and interesting underlying mechanisms. The exploration of the impacts aroused by various influential factors would be a bright future. Future research could be extended on the basis of the current theory at least from the following three facets. First, the exploration of the theory application. As we discussed above, most of previous studies emphasize on investigating the independent effect of individual factor on information processing mode adoption, while little has been discussed on the underlying effects aroused by interactive factors in various contexts. Take the online product review context-a hot topic studied in information systems, marketing, as well as electronic commerce disciplines-as an example, our review of recent studies shows that although the dual process theories have been widely applied to examine the effects of online product reviews, or the review helpfulness itself, there is scant research regarding what factors that really determine which type of information processing mode used, and whether the information processing mode would be dynamically caused by various interactive factors. On the basis of the analysis of our paper which argues that the determinant factors that would be interactive in affecting the information processing mode, related future research with respect to this area could be widely extended. As regard to the research methodology in examining the focal theory, secondly, we call for more advanced method which could be used in future research in order to explore more interesting findings. Particularly, the current studies in relation to the dual process theories largely focus on experimental method or survey, while few attentions have been paid by using behavioral data to deduce what type of information processing mode being used. Based on the research logic presented by recent seminal papers such as Gladstone et al., Stachl et al. and Wu et al., we think it is feasible to extend the method scope to examine this theory. In addition, third, with respect to the extension of the theory itself, in line the recent arguments of seminal papers published on Nature (Rahwan et al.) and California Management Review (Huang et al., we may conjecture that the dual process theory could be extended in the new artificial intelligence era. In particular, during the interaction between human and robot (artificial intelligence), it is imperative to understand whether the robot, cognitively, will use these two different types of processing modes in their information processing like human? How would the robot be in the eye of human when the brain becomes to integrate with robot? Will the robot be the third processing mode complementing with the original two processing mode? Or will the robot interrupt the original two processing modes? Or will the robot replace the one type of either processing mode? We call for future research to further explore the bright and interesting area to explore the effects of interaction between human and robot. © 2021.

"Many educational institutions, assessing their prospects, plan to develop distance educational services using their own electronic and information educational environments (EIEE). During creating and operating EIEE of educational institution (EI), a number of questions arise related to structural, marketing, personnel and other decisions. The purpose of this article is to research the organizational, technical and didactic aspects of the EIEE EI. The methodology of the research is based on methods of system analysis, cybernetics, pedagogical psychology and didacticism. A conceptual model of the EIEE EI as an organizational and technical system has been proposed. It includes a marketing subsystem, a set of technical tools, various types of security and an organizational subsystem. The main functions of these subsystems and their various components have been identified. A didactic model of a typical complex of digital educational resources has been developed. Within this model, the diversity of digital educational resources across each academic discipline is integrated into complexes that provide a complete study at different target levels of assimilation, from initial acquaintance to solving uncharacteristic professionally oriented tasks. From the point of view of pedagogical psychology and cybernetics, the high importance of feedback in EIEE EI is shown. The classification of feedbacks (internal and external) is proposed for the triad ""Teacher - Teaching Program - Learner"". The limits of the use of automation in the formation of feedbacks are specified, as opposed to other (non-computer) responses to students' educational activities. The role and place of feedback in the ""digital footprints"" of students and teachers is shown and the directions for the use of this data in artificial intelligence systems are outlined. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

"Traditional quantitative methods of analysis and simulation are compared with recently developed techniques in qualitative simulation by using as a case-study a simple dynamic model of the interacting markets for housing and mortgages. Analysis by the different techniques shows that while the qualitative simulation requires less detailed models, of the precision normally available in practice, it results in ambiguous descriptions of behaviour that for certain initial conditions can obscure the true behaviour. By contrast, quantitative simulation produces a unique precise behaviour, but in requiring excessively specific information of the modeller it may produce an inaccurate if precise outcome. © 1995.",Wyatt G.J.; Leitch R.R.; Steele A.D.,Not identified,10.1016/0167-9236(94)00030-V,Envisionment; Flowgraph; Housing market; Mortgage market; QSim; Qualitative simulation,50.0,,5,20,,"The abstract discusses comparisons between quantitative and qualitative simulation methods without clearly aligning with the definitions of strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decisions.

"Technology and magic both represent the human will to power - to dominate nature and ultimately humans. In a technological civilization, magic imitates technology. Modern management often entails psychological techniques (the human relations approach) and organizational techniques (the scientific approach). The heart of the latter is statistical measurement and prediction of the future. This article examines the magical use of statistical measurement and prediction of the future. Magic here operates according to the principle of the self-fulfilling prophecy.

"Thought experiments have been used as an effective methodological approach to advance theory in numerous scientific fields. However, they are underutilized in organizational behavior (OB) and adjacent fields. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive and multidisciplinary literature review of thought experiments that entailed 174 sources in economics, psychology, marketing, medicine, sociology, finance, and other fields. We used insights from this literature review to define and describe the unique nature of thought experiments and offer a taxonomy of four main types based on a theory's development stage (i.e., early vs. late) and a study's theoretical goal (i.e., confirmation vs. disconfirmation). We also provide a decision-making tree useful for evaluating whether conducting a thought experiment is beneficial for a particular research situation and which of the four types is most likely to produce a meaningful contribution. Then, we offer best-practice recommendations for conducting thought experiments that address how to plan, execute, report results, and discuss implications. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of thought experiments by using the best-practice recommendations to design and conduct a thought experiment in the domain of workplace allyship. Finally, we offer suggestions for future substantive research that would benefit from thought experiment methodology (i.e., diversity, equity, and inclusion; leadership; performance; selection and recruitment; teams; and turnover). Overall, our article offers a comprehensive review and recommendations that we hope will be a catalyst for using thought experiments to advance theory in OB and related fields. © 2022 The Authors.

"In 2018, a multisite case study investigated the agricultural challenges faced by Maldivian farmers and farming stakeholders. The study interviewed a total of 373 farmers and stakeholders from 51 islands across 15 atolls. In their own words, farmers and stakeholders identified factors in macro and micro levels agricultural systems that are related to poor connectivity between farmers and the markets. This research article conducts a deeper investigation into these factors using the Ecological Systems Theory. In this investigation, the data clearly reveal that any efforts towards market connectivity resolution must address the individual within the context of the greater, extrinsic challenges present in the interrelated systems of farming in the Maldives. While the individual is placed at the smallest level of a greater system, and the interconnections of the larger systems are great in impact, the individual is ultimately the decision maker on what and how things work, and how effective they will be. In this article, five recommendations are identified to enhance farmers’ connectivity to markets.

"Purpose: Over the past 20 years, partial least squares (PLS) has become a popular method in marketing research. At the same time, several methodological studies have demonstrated problems with the technique but have had little impact on its use in marketing research practice. This study aims to present some of these criticisms in a reader-friendly way for non-methodologists. Design/methodology/approach: Key critiques of PLS are summarized and demonstrated using existing data sets in easily replicated ways. Recommendations are made for assessing whether PLS is a useful method for a given research problem. Findings: PLS is fundamentally just a way of constructing scale scores for regression. PLS provides no clear benefits for marketing researchers and has disadvantages that are features of the original design and cannot be solved within the PLS framework itself. Unweighted sums of item scores provide a more robust way of creating scale scores. Research limitations/implications: The findings strongly suggest that researchers abandon the use of PLS in typical marketing studies. Practical implications: This paper provides concrete examples and techniques to practicing marketing and social science researchers regarding how to incorporate composites into their work, and how to make decisions regarding such. Originality/value: This work presents a novel perspective on PLS critiques by showing how researchers can use their own data to assess whether PLS (or another composite method) can provide any advantage over simple sum scores. A composite equivalence index is introduced for this purpose. © 2022, Mikko Rönkkö, Nick Lee, Joerg Evermann, Cameron McIntosh and John Antonakis.",Rönkkö M.; Lee N.; Evermann J.; McIntosh C.; Antonakis J.,Not identified,10.1108/EJM-02-2021-0099,Composites; Measurement; Model testing; Partial least squares; Structural equation models; Theory testing,70.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract presents a critique of a specific statistical method (PLS) used in marketing research without making clear strategic, tactical, or operational implications.

"First Nations peoples have the right to participate in all decisions affecting them. This includes food policy decision-making. In the Australian state of Victoria, the Food Policies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (FoodPATH) project aimed to determine the food policy actions that are likely to be effective and acceptable for Victorian Aboriginal Communities. Community-based workshops were held with six Aboriginal Community-Controlled Organisations (ACCOs) in urban and regional Victoria during 2022. A team of at least three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander facilitators guided participants (n = 53) through a series of workshop activities using group model building methods. Group model building is a participatory systems science research method which enables community stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of the system-level drivers of complex problems and co-design actions to address them. Workshop discussions coincided with real-time creation of a visual system map of the interconnected determinants of food choice. Participants used these maps to develop and prioritise actions for improving food environments and nutrition in the community. Participants identified a diverse array of interconnected factors influencing food choice and nutrition in Aboriginal Communities across Victoria. Food access and affordability, junk food marketing, food knowledge and skills and diet and disease were common themes across all sites, while access to junk food, growing local food, traditional Aboriginal foods, and family, Community and culture were key themes in most sites. Results informed a Community-driven agenda, comprising five Community-led actions and five government policy recommendations for improving food environments and nutrition for Victorian Aboriginal Communities. © 2024 The Author(s)","Browne J.; Walker (Yorta Yorta) T.; Hill (Torres Strait Islander) K.; Mitchell (Mununjali) F.; Beswick H.; Thow (Pennemuker, Ngāti Porou) S.; Ryan (Gunditjmara) J.; Sherriff (Wotjobaluk) S.; Rossignoli A.; Ropitini (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Maniapoto) A.; Johnstone M.; Paradies (Wakaya) Y.; Backholer K.; Allender S.; Brown A.D.",Not identified,10.1016/j.foodpol.2024.102676,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander; First Nations; Food environments; Food policy; Group model building; Systems thinking,50.0,,10,20,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses food policy actions and community engagement but does not align clearly with the definitions provided for strategic, tactical, or operational classifications.

"Despite being recognised as a lucrative segment by the industry, multigenerational family vacation remains an under-researched area. This study explores Korean multigenerational family vacation decision making (FVDM). Using a neo-Confucian epistemology, this study contributes to the existing family tourism literature, which has mainly researched Western nuclear family holidays, by investigating how Korean multigenerational families resolve conflicts during the FVDM process. Data were collected from 14 Korean multigenerational families using focus groups, interviews and visual methods. The study reveals the influence of neo-Confucianism on FVDM communication and the conflict resolution strategies. The vertical communication across generations was guided by filial piety while the horizontal communication within the second generation demonstrates seniority- and male- oriented values. Given the communication patterns, each generation adopted conflict resolution strategies to maintain family harmony, which is a core value of neo-Confucianism.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of e-resources by the Faculty of Law’s academic staff at the University of Namibia’s (UNAM’s) main campus. The study aimed to determine their level of awareness of electronic resources (e-resources) available to them, how useful and effective they found these e-resources, and the challenges they face in accessing them. Design/methodology/approach: A convenient sampling technique was used to select a sample of 12 law academics from the population of 17. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research methods using questionnaires and a semi-structured interview guide. Findings: Findings revealed that the majority of the law academics were aware of the e-resources subscribed by UNAM’s library, although some were not aware of the newly subscribed international law databases. The findings further revealed that the academics used e-resources for research, publications and teaching purposes, but irregular training, bandwidth problems and limited searching skills hindered their use of e-resources. Practical implications: Findings could be used to inform future collection-development decisions, realignment of information-literacy training and promotion and marketing of library services.

"HIGHLIGHTS The family or household provides the major source of labour for undertaking silvicultural practices involved in tree growing. Gender division of labour characterizes silvicultural practices in private forestry. Gender-based allocation of labour is influenced by experience of a household member related to a particular activity as well as competing labour demand in a cropping season. Men play a key and dominant role in decision making on the allocation of labour and marketing of timber. Mere ownership of woodlots by women is not a feasible pathway to having control over income obtained from the sales of timber from their woodlots. SUMMARY This paper draws on a study conducted in the selected districts of Iringa and Njombe regions in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania where over the past decade Non-industrial Private Forestry (NIPF) has emerged involving village-based domestic investors. Data for the study were largely collected using focus group discussions (FGDs) of men and women tree growers. Data were analysed using content analysis focusing on the emerging themes, subthemes, and patterns. The paper shows that gender division of labour characterizes silvicultural practices in private forestry. Men play a key and dominant role in decision making on the allocation of labour and marketing of timber. We argue that, given this arrangement, as long as men continue to dominate the market sphere, mere ownership of woodlots by women is not a feasible pathway to having control over income obtained from the sales of timber from their woodlots. To address this, the paper comes up with some recommendations. © 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

"Sustainability in architecture engages a wide range of considerations in the light of the significant negative impact of buildings on the environment. One aspect of research in this parlance engages the technological and the social dimensions of building innovation, which promote the use of renewable technology as a mitigation strategy. The challenge, however, is that the end-users or building clients do not always have sufficient awareness and information regarding these technologies to guide their decision to accept it. Consequently, the diffusion of said innovations is slow, and the environmental or building problems they were invented to solve persist at the expense of both humanity and the environment. This study, therefore, focuses on a quantitative investigation to ascertain the level of awareness and interest of residents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) as an example of renewable energy-based building technology. In this study, 289 residents participated, following the distribution of a questionnaire to demographically distinct individuals. This distinction was used in the analysis to highlight different groups such as, gender, generations, and occupational background of the respondents. The findings of the study show, firstly, that there is a high level of awareness of BIPV in the sample. The study also shows that comparing awareness with each of these demographic variables produced a second layer of findings. For example, the statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference between the level of awareness and any of the demographic characteristics of the study participants. However, there is a significant statistical difference (p = 0.000) between awareness and interest in BIPV. In concluding this study, recommendations for further research that elaborates other statistical variables and tests, as well as a follow-up qualitative investigation are planned and outlined for future studies. The findings of this investigation may be of benefit to researchers, policy makers, as well as energy companies and marketing agencies within and outside the region. © 2021 by the authors.

"Background Philip Morris Products SA (PMPSA) submitted a premarket tobacco application (PMTA) to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking an order permitting it to market IQOS in the USA. US law requires FDA to deny marketing authorisation if applicants fail to demonstrate that their product is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. FDA issued a marketing order for IQOS in April 2019, which Philip Morris is using to promote IQOS outside the USA. Methods We analysed FDA's Technical Project Lead Review and marketing order for IQOS, relevant law and guidance on PMTAs and independent research on the health impacts of IQOS. Results FDA found that the evidence PMPSA submitted did not demonstrate reduction in long-term disease risks and that IQOS aerosol emits toxins with carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, some at higher levels than conventional cigarettes. PMPSA did not appropriately consider the health impacts of dual use, the product's attractiveness to youth or data showing that consumers do not accurately perceive the addiction risks of IQOS. Despite FDA's own scientists' recommendations and independent research showing that IQOS presents serious risks to users including cytotoxic, genotoxic, hepatotoxic, cardiovascular and pulmonary risks, FDA concluded that IQOS is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'.

"Agriculture is highly sensitive to variations in both weather and climate. Farmers face uncertainty in the weather patterns over the short term, and climate over the longer term. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) has promoted a system of Local Technical Agro-Climatic Committees (LTACs)4 in two Colombian regions to explore means of creating dialogue between researchers and farmers that would provide farmers with options in the face of both short- and longer-term variations in climate. The article uses a case study approach to describe how the original LTACs were established, the benefits obtained from the LTAC system, and the expansion of the system to areas outside Colombia. The basic premise behind the LTAC approach is: If farmers and the local rural community at large can access and understand weather and climate forecasts and the responses of their crop production, processing, and marketing options under local conditions, they can make better decisions on how to manage their farms and businesses. There are six basic components that are required to implement the LTAC approach to bridging the gap between climate science and farmers: (i) Establishment of the LTAC with alignment of local parties interested in managing variation in the climate and definition of their roles; (ii) local climate and monthly climate forecast; (iii) crop modeling and understanding of climate variation on crop production, processing and marketing and the impact this will have on management; (iv) dialogue between scientists, experts, and farmers; (v) dissemination and socialization of the dialogue; and (vi) local capacity building, which cuts across all the other five components. The regular monthly meetings of the LTACs are the focal point of the overall process, bringing together information from various sources, organizing the ideas and thoughts, and then disseminating the information. A feature of the committees was their diversity. The committees required specific inputs, particularly on climate and the crop response before each meeting. Research organizations provided climate forecasts and crop response data. The forecasts proved closer to reality than long term means and the crops models that were used to predict crop response to changes in management and climate variation were relatively simple and unsophisticated. The committees gained confidence in these prognoses, which then formed the basis for dialogue on how best to manage climate variation. The production-side participants appreciated the opportunity to present their own points of view and the move from top-down recommendations, coming from the researchers and extension agents, towards a menu of options which they discussed. At the same time, it was evident in the early meetings that many of the participants came ill-prepared to grasp concepts related to managing climatic variation, thus highlighting the need for capacity building within the LTACs themselves. LTACs actively promulgated their findings through bulletins, social networks, extension services, farmers’ organizations radio, TV, and the press. In the dry El Niño year of 2015, many farmers used the information generated by the LTACs to better manage their crops, increasing yields, and reducing losses. More LTACs are now being established in Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. These countries have understood the value of creating mechanisms through which researches and farmers can exchange ideas, with the farmers choosing options to improve their management based on better weather and climate forecasts and an understanding of how the weather and climate affects their crops. © 2018 The Authors",Loboguerrero A.M.; Boshell F.; León G.; Martinez-Baron D.; Giraldo D.; Recaman Mejía L.; Díaz E.; Cock J.,Not identified,10.1016/j.crm.2018.08.001,Agro-climatic information; CCAFS; Climate risk; Colombia; Local communities; Participatory approach,80.0,,5,5,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of Local Technical Agro-Climatic Committees (LTACs) to facilitate dialogue between farmers and researchers about climate variations and their impacts on agriculture.

"The study examines the research methodology of more than 200 empirical investigations of ethics in personal selling and sales management between 1980 and 2010. The review discusses the sources and authorship of the sales ethics research. To better understand the drivers of empirical sales ethics research, the foundations used in business, marketing, and sales ethics are compared. The use of hypotheses, operationalization, measurement, population and sampling decisions, research design, and statistical analysis techniques were examined as part of theory development and testing. The review establishes a benchmark, assesses the status and direction of the sales ethics research methodology, and helps inform researchers who need to deal with increasing amounts of empirical research. The investigation identified changing sources of publication with the Journal of Business Ethics and the Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management maintaining their position as the main conduit of high quality empirical sales ethics research. The results suggest that despite the use of theoretical models for empirical testing, a greater variety of moral frameworks and wider use of marketing exchange theory is needed. The review highlights many sound aspects about the empirical sales ethics research statistical methodology but also raises concerns about several areas.

"Health-related knowledge has been assumed to inform lifestyle choices for school-aged students. A ‘health-promoting school’ provides the conceptual framework for this intervention. A large boarding school developed, implemented and refined a Nutritional Symbol System for their dining hall. The effectiveness of this social marketing strategy and school-based Health Education Program was evaluated by interviewing students (n = 16) for nutritional knowledge and application of the Nutritional Symbol System (NSS) to food choices in a range of contexts within (for example, in the dining hall and canteen) and beyond the school. In-depth interview data were collected, recorded and analyzed manually and via the Leximancer text mining software. Results indicated that there was a lack of consistent and accurate student knowledge derived from the Health Education Programs.

"Indonesia has witnessed extreme weather conditions in various regions in recent times. In the early 2013, these conditions have caused flood in Karawang district. This extremity in climate conditions indicates that climate change has occurred. Climate change, in the form of high/low rainfall, erratic rainfall or changes in the rainy/dry season, has become problem to paddy farmers of Karawang district, who have faced increase in post-harvest losses of paddy. Technological capability of farmers is one of the main factors that play important role in tackling such conditions. Measurement of post-harvest technological capabilities of paddy farmers in dealing with climate change is carried out using six criteria, such as the production capability, investment capability, capability to make small changes, capability to make major changes, marketing capability, and capability to create network. The methods used to measure the technological capabilities are the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Non-Numeric Multi Expert Multi Criteria Decision Making (MEMCDM).

"At-destination referrals from local experts play a critical and complementary role in information sourcing and venue decision strategies by visitors of a destination. This context-specific form of word-of-moulh communication is widely practiced, yet remains an under-researched phenomenon when taking into consideration the broad range of locals utilized by visitors when making at-destination decisions on travel-related services. Most word-of-mouth studies have examined its influence on consumer's purchase behavior, but few attempts have been made to investigate the local experts' perspective. This exploratory study attempts to contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon from the local experts' perspective from two aspects: (1) examining the nature and significance of at-destination recommendations; and (2) developing and testing a motivational construct of locals making recommendations. The results provide further evidence of a broad range of residents within a community being involved in the provision of venue information and direct property referrals. A test of motivational scale items reveals that five themes emerge as the underlying constructs driving the local experts' referral behavior. Discussion and implications are also provided based on the study results. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly popular concept, although it is often used only as a marketing tool to label activities that are very far from AI. The purpose of this article is to show what artificial intelligence (AI) tools - expert systems - can actually be used for administrative decision in public administration. The end of the administrative decision must be justified in detail according to the legal regulations. Expert systems do this. The other large group of AI tools, solutions based on machine learning, act as black boxes, mapping input data to output data, so the reason for the solution is unknown. Therefore, these tools are not suitable for direct, administrative decision, but can support office work with expert systems.

"In this research, we investigate the behavior of Cronbach's coefficient alpha and its new standard error. We systematically analyze the effects of sample size, scale length, strength of item intercorrelations, and scale dimensionality. We demonstrate the beneficial effects of sample size on alpha's standard error and of scale length and the strengths of item intercorrelations (effects that are substitutes in their benefits) on both alpha and its standard error. Our findings also speak to this adage: Heterogeneity within the item covariance matrix (e.g., through multidimensionality or poor items) negatively impacts reliability by decreasing the precision of the estimation. We also examined the question of equilibrium scale length, showing the conditions for which it is optimal to add no items, or one, or multiple items to a scale. In terms of best practices, we recommend that researchers report a confidence interval or standard error along with the coefficient alpha point estimate.","Duhachek, A; Coughlan, AI; Iacobucci, D",Not identified,10.1287/mksc.1040.0097,measurement; survey research; reliability; coefficient alpha,35.0,,10,35,INFORMS,The abstract discusses statistical analysis and reliability measurement rather than marketing or strategic decision-making.

"Historically, the fields of Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems grew up from different backgrounds; Management Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence, respectively. As a result, many people still regard them as unrelated fields, although Operational Researchers are working in both of them. Expert Systems in particular have found it difficult to escape from an image of being isolated; not just from Decision Support Systems, but from all other types of computer system. Successful applications appeared to be confined to very well-defined tasks; either small systems for tasks of an operational nature, or large systems requiring expensive specialised computer support. The spread of Expert Systems into management and administrative applications from the scientific/technical domains of the early systems has been very slow. The view put forward in this paper is that for Expert Systems to be applied to problems in management or administration, the traditional 'closed-world' picture of an Expert System is usually inadequate. The real manifestation of the Expert System's role (and indeed that of the human expert) involves much more negotiation and interaction than in scientific/ technical domains. The consequences for the resulting system are that it looks much more like the traditional picture of a Decision Support System than a classic standalone Expert System. The argument will be illustrated by reference to examples of 'Expert System' developments, including systems for production control, crime pattern analysis, telephone marketing, and the drawing up of contracts.","EDWARDS, JS",Not identified,10.1016/0377-2217(92)90273-C,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; PRACTICE,15.0,,10,50,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"The abstract discusses the interplay between Expert Systems and Decision Support Systems, focusing on their historical development and application challenges rather than a specific marketing context.",wos-artificial intelligence,15,10,EXPERT SYSTEMS IN MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION - ARE THEY REALLY DIFFERENT FROM DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,1992
"This research challenges the notion that autonomy is beneficial for consumers in every situation. Specifically, this research demonstrates across two experiments and one field study that autonomy can lead to pleasure only when risk is low. Importantly, these studies also identify personal control as a mechanism that explains why autonomy makes the consumption experience more or less pleasurable, depending on risk perceptions. In Study 1, we demonstrate that perceived risk moderates the effect that autonomy may have on making the experience pleasurable, with a lack of risk making autonomy increase personal control. Study 2 replicates this moderating effect of risk in a field study. To test if the effects replicate using another type of perceived risk, Study 3 manipulates social risk and replicates its moderating effect on the relationship between autonomy and personal control on the pleasure observed in Studies 1 and 2. Collectively, this research draws attention to the need to consider risk when making consumers autonomous, and it offers novel contributions to the work on consumer autonomy.","Lunardo, R; Saintives, C",Not identified,10.1177/2051570719828674,autonomy; personal control; pleasure; risk,70.0,,5,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the effects of autonomy on consumer pleasure in relation to perceived risk, which does not align clearly with any specific classification level.

"The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed.

"How do people make choices when they see two equally positive versus two equally negative decision alternatives? The cancel-and-focus hypothesis argues that when people see options in a sequence, they tend to overweight the unique attributes of the first alternative. This leads to the prediction that when both options are positive (approach-approach conflict), the first option is preferred more but that if they are both negative (avoidance-avoidance conflict), the first option is preferred less. Based on recent research, we argue that this finding may be contingent on an unrecognized compatibility confound with the decision frame of choosing versus rejecting. In this research, we argue that the choice biases predicted by the cancel-and-focus hypothesis will be more pronounced when the decision frame (choose/reject) is incompatible with the valence of the alternatives (reject-positive and choose-negative) because such incompatibility increases processing motivation. We report two studies with varying operationalizations of decision conflict which find that cancel-and-focus effects are more pronounced under incompatibility. Taken together, these findings suggest that conflict effects are better understood by accounting for the decision frame as well.","Krishnamurthy, P; Nagpal, A",Not identified,10.1007/s11002-009-9079-0,Decision frame; Decision conflict; Approach-approach; Avoidance-avoidance; Compatibility,75.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses decision-making processes and theoretical hypotheses rather than concrete examples or applications in marketing, making it difficult to classify within the provided categories.",wos-prediction,10,5,Making choices under conflict: The impact of decision frames,2010

"Objective: The objective was to review and integrate available research about the construct of state-level suspicion as it appears in social science literatures and apply the resulting findings to information technology (IT) contexts. Background: Although the human factors literature is replete with articles about trust (and distrust) in automation, there is little on the related, but distinct, construct of ""suspicion"" (in either automated or IT contexts). The construct of suspicion-its precise definition, theoretical correlates, and role in such applications-deserves further study. Method: Literatures that consider suspicion are reviewed and integrated. Literatures include communication, psychology, human factors, management, marketing, information technology, and brain/neurology. We first develop a generic model of state-level suspicion. Research propositions are then derived within IT contexts. Results: Fundamental components of suspicion include (a) uncertainty, (b) increased cognitive processing (e.g., generation of alternative explanations for perceived discrepancies), and (c) perceptions of (mal)intent. State suspicion is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of these three components. Our analysis also suggests that trust inhibits suspicion, whereas distrust can be a catalyst of state-level suspicion. Based on a three-stage model of state-level suspicion, associated research propositions and questions are developed. These propositions and questions are intended to help guide future work on the measurement of suspicion (self-report and neurological), as well as the role of the construct of suspicion in models of decision making and detection of deception. Conclusion: The study of suspicion, including its correlates, antecedents, and consequences, is important. We hope that the social sciences will benefit from our integrated definition and model of state suspicion. The research propositions regarding suspicion in IT contexts should motivate substantial research in human factors and related fields.

"The wood products industry is facing increasing challenges from global competition, and automation of manufacturing can greatly help companies in the industry to handle such challenges. Investments in automation of manufacturing are more likely to succeed if they are the expression of informed and systematic decisions. This paper aims to increase the knowledge on the process leading to investment decisions on automation of manufacturing in the wood products industry, as well as on the aspects considered in such processes. A real-time case study was conducted at a large Swedish wood manufacturing company to gain in-depth understanding of decisions related to automation investments. The findings demonstrate that mainly representatives from manufacturing and marketing functions were involved throughout the investment project's length. This could be a contributing factor to the narrow view on automation of manufacturing when decisions are made, where focus is placed on financial and technological aspects. The findings further show a limited knowledge regarding automation of manufacturing, which resulted in a tendency to heavily rely on the technical supplier’s recommendations.

In the domain of second language (L2) listening, self-access work can fulfill the individual needs of learners whose listening processes are supposed to be respected. However, in countries where English is taught as a foreign language (EFL), this is not always the case due to traditional teacher-led large-sized listening classrooms and test-oriented curricula. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate Vietnamese students’ perceptions of a self-access listening platform (SALP) which was built to facilitate L2 beginners to get familiar with the fast delivery of speech and to involve their personal interpretations of the input into the comprehension process. The study also aimed to examine whether this self-access approach can cultivate autonomous listening. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews with 15 non-English major university students whose disciplines were business management, marketing, communication, and public relations. They completed a six-week listening course on this online listening platform. The major findings indicate that students had positive listening experiences with the SALP regarding time flexibility and practicality. Despite students’ full awareness of the potential benefits of the SALP, a few of them still showed resistance to the self-access listening approach as a substitution for traditional classroom-based listening. The results reported here shed new light on the possibilities of implementing autonomy-based listening in a virtual self-access environment in L2 listening pedagogy. © 2023 Author(s).",Thi Mai V.L.,Not identified,10.37237/140303,learner autonomy; learners’ perceptions; self-access language learning; self-access listening; Vietnamese EFL learners,100.0,,0,0,Kanda University of International Studies,"The abstract discusses self-access language learning and perceptions of a listening platform within educational contexts, which does not align with the definitions provided for strategic, tactical, or operational classifications related to marketing.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,Autonomy-Based Listening: Vietnamese University Students’ Perceptions of Self-Access Web-Based Listening Practices,2023
"Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer science. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Zhang H.; Vorobeychik Y.,Not identified,10.1007/s10462-017-9577-z,Agent-based modeling; Calibration; Empirical method; Innovation diffusion; Literature review; Validation,80.0,,5,0,Springer Netherlands,"The abstract discusses agent-based modeling and innovation diffusion but does not clearly align with marketing-related strategic, tactical, or operational decisions.

"The imagery of any foodstuff is shaped by assumptions of what is culturally valued as food, assumptions that are also fed by marketing, expert nutritional advice and intermittent food ""alarms"". This paper raises the issue of risk communication versus advertising and argues that in order to better understand consumers' response to food risk communication we should pay closer attention to the broader information environment in which the compromised foodstuffs are embedded. Any new information properly crafted in the form of ""risk messages"" necessarily interacts with the information that constitutes the foodstuff's environment. It is proposed that focusing on such an environment, rather than on the ""content"" of the risk message alone, improves understanding of how the risk message eventually triggers further selections and decisions about the compromised foodstuff. The risk communication is itself a media event and is seen as part of the food information environment rather than autonomous to it.",Ferreira C.,Not identified,10.1080/13669870601065536,Consumers; Food; Marketing; Risk communication; The media,70.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the interaction between food risk communication and the broader information environment but does not clearly fit into any of the defined categories of strategic, tactical, or operational decision-making.

"Sustainable ecosystem services consumption is of vital importance to the survival and development of human society. How to balance the conflicts between ecosystem protection and ecosystem services consumption by local residents has been a serious challenge, especially in ecologically vulnerable areas. To explore the reasonable ecosystem services consumption approaches of grassland ecosystems for sustainable land system management, this study takes Hulun Buir of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a case study region and develops an EcoC-G (ecological consumption of grassland) model based on herders' livelihood behaviors using the agent-based model technique to simulate the dynamics of ecosystem pressure, livestock production, and living quality of herders under different grassland management scenarios over the next 30 years. The EcoC-G model links the supply and consumption of grassland ecosystem services by calculating the ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) supply and household NPP consumption. The model includes three sub-models, namely, the individual status transferring sub-model, the households' grassland-use decision sub-model, and the ecosystem pressure sub-model. In accordance with multi-objective grassland management practices, the following four land management scenarios were simulated: (1) baseline scenario, (2) increasing household's living standard, (3) ecosystem protection, and (4) balancing living standard improvement with the protection of the ecosystem. The result indicates that by focusing on the NPP supply and consumption of the grassland ecosystem, the EcoC-G is capable of simulating the impacts of herders' livelihood behaviors on grassland ecosystems. If timely grassland management strategies are implemented, it is possible to relieve the ecosystem pressure and improve the livelihood of local herders. The specific scenario simulation results are: (1) Under the current grassland management mode, the pasture could never be overgrazed, and herders could achieve the basic living standard, but the accumulated wealth decreased due to the decline of livestock. (2) With grazing control, herders can accumulate wealth by increasing the breeding amount and reducing the marketing rate, but the ecosystem consumption pressure can reach a maximum of 2.3 times. (3) With strict restrictions on the livestock number, the pressure on the ecosystem decreases; however, herders might not achieve basic living standards. (4) Modest regulation leads to rational ecological consumption intervals, meaning the ecosystem pressure will become stable and herders can gradually accumulate wealth with the achievement of basic living standards in advance. © 2019 by the authors.",Yan H.; Pan L.; Xue Z.; Zhen L.; Bai X.; Hu Y.; Huang H.-Q.,Not identified,10.3390/su11082261,Agent-based modeling (ABM); Ecosystem pressure; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem services consumption; Net primary productivity,70.0,,0,30,MDPI,"The abstract discusses ecosystem services consumption and management strategies without clearly aligning with any of the defined categories (Strategic, Tactical, or Operational) related to marketing or organizational decision-making.

"Imagine you are a real estate agent and are showing a prospective buyer a house with a lake view, but it is foggy, and the view is less than ideal. Are you inclined to tell the prospective buyer, Unfortunately, it is foggy outside. If it were not foggy, the view would be even better!? Eight studies, spanning diverse domains, reveal a novel discrepancy: most presenters (e.g., the seller) choose to communicate such upward counterfactual information (UCI) to experiencers (e.g., the prospective buyer), believing it will enhance experiencers' impressions (e.g., of the house)-yet UCI actually worsens their impressions. This discrepancy arises because presenters insufficiently account for the fact that they possess more knowledge about the presented target than experiencers do; they fail to realize that noting an imperfection reveals it. Accordingly, when experiencers are knowledgeable about the target, either because the imperfection is obvious or because they can easily envision the upward counterfactual, the discrepancy attenuates. Finally, the presenter-experiencer discrepancy occurs only when the counterfactual information is upward, such that presenters do not overcommunicate downward counterfactual information, which rules out a desire to share any information as an alternative mechanism for presenters' communication decisions. Together, this research highlights the prevalence and costs of sharing UCI.","Li, XL; Hsee, CK; O'Brien, E",Not identified,10.1177/00222437221112312,prediction errors; self-other asymmetry; communication; egocentrism; counterfactual thinking,60.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses a psychological phenomenon related to communication and presentation of information, which does not clearly fit into the defined categories of Strategic, Tactical, or Operational decision-making in marketing.

"Academic work on sales compensation plans features agency models prominently, and these models have also been used to build decision aids for managers. However, empirical support remains sketchy. We conducted three experiments to investigate three unresolved predictions involving the incentive-insurance trade-off posited in the model. First, compensation should be less incentive loaded with greater effort-output uncertainty so as to provide additional insurance to a risk-averse agent. Second, flat wages should be used for verifiable effort so as to avoid unnecessary incentives. Third, less incentive-loaded plans should be used with more risk-averse agents so as to provide additional insurance. Our design implemented explicit solutions from a specific agency model, which offers greater internal validity, compared to extant laboratory designs that either did not implement explicit solutions or excluded certain parameters. In Experiment I, data from working manager subjects supported the first prediction but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. We interpret this as disclosing the model's core circumstance, wherein it orders the data when the incentive-insurance trade-off is relevant. Thus, when verifiable effort made incentives moot, as is the case for the second prediction, the model failed to order the data. Building on these results, we reasoned that the third prediction should find support among risk-averse agents but not among risk-neutral agents, because insurance is a moot point with the latter agents. To this end, we added risk-neutral utility functions for agents in Experiment II. Data from MBA-candidate student subjects supported the predictions, but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. In those cells in which the incentive-insurance trade-off was moot (either because of risk-neutrality or else verifiability), the data did not support the predictions. We confronted several validity threats to these results. To begin, Experiment I used the standard agency solution, which equalizes an agent's expected utility from the predicted plan with his expected utility from rejecting it. Subjects might have broken these ties on such grounds as fairness. To assess whether this confounded the results, we derived new solutions in Experiment II that broke ties in favor of the predicted plan (by a 10% margin in the expected utility). Our results were robust to this change. Second, our agents' behavior in Experiments I and II was much more consistent with predictions, compared to the principals' behavior, which brought up task comprehension as a validity threat because our principals faced a more complex experimental task than the agents. To address this threat, we used three decision rounds in Experiment III to reduce the principals' task comprehension problems. A related validity threat arose from the relatively small gap in some cells between a principal's predicted expected utility and the principal's next best choice. To address this threat, we derived new solutions with larger gaps to make the principal's choices easier. The results were again robust to these changes, which removes these validity threats. We also addressed two alternative explanations. Might principals be predisposed to pick salary plus commission plans regardless of the model's predictions? If so, we should find such plans chosen uniformly across different experimental conditions. Pooling the data from our three experiments, we rejected this predisposition explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with treatment differences across cells. Second, might agents choose higher effort levels because of a demand bias? If so, we should find agents picking high effort regardless of the plan actually offered to them. Using pooled data, we rejected this explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with a utility-maximizing reaction to the plan actually offered to them. Finally, we included manipulation checks to assess whether principals and agents perceived experimental stimuli identically, as per the common knowledge assumption in game theory. These data showed no differences between agents' and principals' perceptions of stimuli. Our experiments move the literature from simply asking whether the model works to pinpointing the circumstances in which it orders behavior. The primary stylized fact we uncovered is the persistent and striking lack of support for the agency model outside of the circumstance in which risk-averse agents undertake nonverifiable effort. The model's failure when there is no material insurance-incentive tradeoff deserves scrutiny in future work.","Ghosh, M; John, G",Not identified,10.1287/mksc.19.4.348.11792,experimental economics; agency theory; sales compensation; salesforce,65.0,,10,5,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses agency models and empirical investigations related to sales compensation plans, which do not fit cleanly into the categories of strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decisions.

"Avatars, as virtual humans possessing realistic faces, are increasingly used for social and economic interaction on the Internet. Research has already determined that avatar-based communication may increase perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3) the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.","Riedl, R; Mohr, PNC; Kening, PH; Davis, FD; Hekeren, HR",Not identified,10.2753/MIS0742-1222300404,agent; avatar; brain; cognitive neuroscience; evolutionary psychology; evolution theory; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); medial frontal cortex (MFC); mentalizing; NeuroIS; theory-of-mind (TOM),60.0,,10,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the perception of trust in human vs. avatar interactions but does not clearly fit into strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing.

"Given curiosity's characterization as a motivational drive for knowledge, prior research has primarily focused on curiosity's positive effects on knowledge exploration, information acquisition, and learning. Once the desired knowledge has been acquired, curiosity is said to be satisfied. But what happens if curiosity is left unsatisfied? Across five experiments, spanning four domains of indulgence-related decisions and relying on different methods of curiosity elicitation, the present research sheds light on an unexpected yet crucial consequence of curiosity-that unsatisfied curiosity tempts indulgent consumption in domains unrelated to the source of the curiosity. This effect is explained by a generalized desire for rewards. Experiments 1-3 establish and replicate the proposed mediation model of curiosity -> desire for rewards -> indulgence, employing manipulation-of-process, moderation-of-process, and measurement-of-process experimental designs. Experiment 4 utilizes neurophysiological data to indicate brain activation in the insular cortex for unsatisfied (vs. satisfied) curiosity. Experiment 5 addresses the role of cognitive depletion as a possible alternative mechanism. In summary, this article demonstrates that the hunger for information that accompanies unsatisfied curiosity is converted into a generalized desire for rewards, which in turn tempts indulgence.","Wiggin, KL; Reimann, M; Jain, SP",Not identified,10.1093/jcr/ucy055,curiosity; desire for rewards; indulgent consumption; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; insula; multimethod mediation,55.0,,5,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"The abstract discusses the effects of unsatisfied curiosity on indulgent consumption, which does not clearly align with any of the defined strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing decisions.

"Although personality is a key determinant of consumer purchasing decision making, the role of personality traits in impulse buying and variety seeking is not conclusive. This research uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among impulse buying tendency (IBT), variety seeking tendency (VST), and the Big Five personality traits within one integrated framework. Based on data from a nationally representative sample of 1644 Norwegian adults, the results show that while IBT and VST might be correlated, they differ significantly with respect to two major personality aspects: neuroticism and openness to experience. Specifically, the present study indicates that neuroticism predicted IBT positively and VST negatively, while openness was a strong predictor of VST and unrelated to IBT.

"When judging objects described by incomplete evidence, people often make judgments on the basis of what is known and fail to adjust for what is unknown. However, contextual factors may increase sensitivity to the limited weight of the given information. Consistent with this hypothesis, four experiments show that sensitivity to the limitations of the evidence and the likelihood of judgmental moderation increases when (a) a target is judged in the context of a similar object described on dimensions different from those used to describe the target, or (b) a target is judged in the context of a completely different type of object described by a relatively large amount of information. Considered together, the results suggest that judgment is moderated when contextual objects or cues alert judges to specific omissions or when contextual cues imply a general lack of information. The findings illuminate the diverse effects that even context objects of a different category have on information integration judgment. Context objects may affect the weighting as well as the valuation of the evidence about targets described by limited information and thereby contribute to judgmental moderation. Finally, the findings illustrate the contextually sensitive nature of the weighting criteria that guide information integration.

"Financial advisors seek to accurately measure individuals' risk preferences and provide sound personalized investment advice. Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the Pension Builder, and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer-online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.

"This article reviews the difficulties facing national courts in respect of the regulation of online gambling activity in the wake of two recent decisions of the European Court of Justice that, in mixed messages, may be moving towards liberalization of the European gaming market. More than a year after the Gambelli and Lindman decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the first report of the European Commission on the application of the electronic commerce Directive, the impact of these recent European (r)evolutions for the gaming industry has not always been very clear. In the Netherlands and Belgium, existing jurisprudence was confirmed in the so-called post-Gambelli decisions. In Germany, where most of the competences to regulate gaming activities have been attributed to the autonomous Länder, some courts have recognized that, in the absence of a consistent gaming policy, the imposed restrictions on the cross-border provision of gaming services could not be justified by the imperative reasons of public order. In Spain, the Loterías y Apuestas del Estado (LAE) is maintaining its position that it has the exclusive right to offer and promote games on the Internet. In Italy, a regional court has had to refer a gaming case to European Court of Justice (ECJ). The conclusion of one year post-Gambelli case-law is that the Gambelli and Lindman requirements are applied in a very diverging manner. In the Dutch Betfair appeal case, it was even insinuated that Gambelli was not relevant!

"Currently, the European Union (EU) is focusing on a large-scale campaign dedicated to developing a competitive circular economy and expanding the single digital market. One of the main goals of this campaign is the implementation of the sustainability principles in the development and deployment cycle of the new generation technologies.

Currently, most state-of-the-art navigation methods are utilising the idea of evaluating candidate observation locations by combining different task-related criteria. However, these map building solutions are often designed for operating in near-perfect environments, neglecting such factors as the danger to the robot. In this paper, a new strategy that aims to address the safety and re-usability of the autonomous mobile agent by implementing the economic sustainability principles is proposed. A novel multi-criteria decision-making method ofWeighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment-Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets, namely WASPAS-SVNS, and the weight selection method of Step-Wise Weights Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) are applied to model a dynamic decision-making system.

The results confirm the relevance of data management in journalistic practice, requiring skills in statistics, data visualization, technology, but also in ethics, marketing or audience monitoring. © 2018 (Idoia Portilla).",Portilla I.,Not identified,10.15847/obsobs12320181245,Big data; Content analysis; Management; Skills; Visualization,60.0,,10,5,Obercom,"The abstract discusses the need for journalists to acquire new data-related skills, which does not fit neatly into the defined categories of strategic, tactical, or operational decision-making in a marketing context.",scopus-big data,10,15,Contributions of academic articles to the practice of journalism and data management,2018
"If the 1990s was all about the information superhighway and the network society, then the first 10 years of the 21st century is perhaps best described as the decade of data. Actors in different enterprises worked feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital data will give objective insight into human relations and provide authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of communication and social shaping of database and data mining technologies in the institutional context of genome science to understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with biological, physical, and big data. We found a rise in the use of racial discourse that suggests race has a genetic foundation. © 2013 (Peter A. Chow-White & Sandy E.

"Social media and big data uses form part of a broader shift from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’ forms of governance in which state bodies engage in analysis to predict, pre-empt and respond in real time to a range of social problems. Drawing on research with British police, we contextualize these algorithmic processes within actual police practices, focusing on protest policing. Although aspects of algorithmic decision-making have become prominent in police practice, our research shows that they are embedded within a continuous human–computer negotiation that incorporates a rooted claim to ‘professional judgement’, an integrated intelligence context and a significant level of discretion. This context, we argue, transforms conceptions of threats. We focus particularly on three challenges: the inclusion of pre-existing biases and agendas, the prominence of marketing-driven software, and the interpretation of unpredictability. Such a contextualized analysis of data uses provides important insights for the shifting terrain of possibilities for dissent. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Dencik L.; Hintz A.; Carey Z.,Not identified,10.1177/1461444817697722,Big data; dissent; predictive policing; protest; social media,20.0,,5,50,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses the use of big data and social media in policing but does not fit clearly into the strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing.

"Business analytics courses, such as marketing research, data mining, forecasting, and advanced financial modeling, have substantial predictive modeling components. The predictive modeling in these courses requires students to estimate and test many linear regressions. As a result, false positive variable selection (type I errors) is nearly certain to occur. This article describes an in-class demonstration that shows the frequency and impact of false positives on data mining regression-based predictive modeling. In this demonstration, 500 randomly generated independent (X) variables are individually regressed against a single, randomly generated (Y) variable, and the resulting 500 p-values are sorted and examined. This experiment is repeated and the distribution of the number of variables significant at the 5% level resulting from this simulation is presented and discussed. The demonstration provides a tangible example in which students see the reality and risks of incorrectly inferring statistical significance of independent regression variables. Students have expressed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the risks of type I errors through this demonstration. This demonstration is innovative because the scale of the simulation allows the students to experience the near certainty that the correlations shown in the results are truly random. © 2014 Decision Sciences Institute.",Pinder J.P.,Not identified,10.1111/dsji.12037,Business Analytics; Hypothesis testing; Regression; Simulation,75.0,,5,0,Wiley-Blackwell,"The abstract discusses a demonstration related to the understanding of false positives in predictive modeling, which does not clearly fit into the strategic, tactical, or operational categories as defined.

"Grape yield prediction is an important tool used by growers to optimize vineyard management and obtain better income. In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Arab S.T.; Noguchi R.; Matsushita S.; Ahamed T.,Not identified,10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100485,LAI; Machine learning; NDVI; NDWI; Satellite remote sensing; Vineyard yield,10.0,,10,60,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses grape yield prediction using machine learning and satellite imagery, which does not clearly align with strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decision-making as defined.

"Purpose: The negative influence of gamification on online communities has received little attention in the available literature. The study examines the adverse effects of gamification during engaging in online communities. Design/methodology/approach: Gap-spotting methods were used to develop the research questions, followed by model development using the social exchange and social-network theories. Data were collected from 429 samples. The study applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses followed by ANN application. Findings: The study identified five factors related to gamification that have a significant adverse effect on the mental and emotional well-being of the users. Furthermore, the results of PLS-SEM were then compared through an artificial neural network (ANN) analytic process, revealing consistency for the model. This research presents a theoretical contribution by providing critical insights into online gamers' mental and emotional health. It implies that gamification can even bring mental and emotional disturbance. The resulting situation might lead to undesirable social consequences. Practical implications: The result highlights the managerial and social relevance from the perspective of a developing country. As respondents are becoming more engrossed in online gaming, managers and decision-makers need to take preventive measures to overcome the dark side of online gaming. Originality/value: The present study shows that the dark side of gamification has some adverse effects on human mental and emotional health.

"We are all saints and sinners: Some of our actions benefit others, while other actions lead to harm. How do people balance moral rights against moral wrongs when evaluating others' actions? Across 9 studies, we contrast the predictions of three conceptions of intuitive morality—outcome-based (utilitarian), act-based (deontologist), and person-based (virtue ethics) approaches. These experiments establish four principles: Partial offsetting (good acts can partly offset bad acts), diminishing sensitivity (the extent of the good act has minimal impact on its offsetting power), temporal asymmetry (good acts are more praiseworthy when they come after harms), and act congruency (good acts are more praiseworthy to the extent they offset a similar harm). These principles are difficult to square with utilitarian or deontological approaches, but sit well within person-based approaches to moral psychology. Inferences about personal character mediated many of these effects (Studies 1–4), explained differences across items and across individuals (Studies 5–6), and could be manipulated to produce downstream consequences on blame (Studies 7–9); however, there was some evidence for more modest roles of utilitarian and deontological processing too. These findings contribute to conversations about moral psychology and person perception, and may have policy and marketing implications. © 2020",Johnson S.G.B.; Ahn J.,Not identified,10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104467,Intuitive ethics; Moral judgment; Person perception; Reputation; Social cognition,30.0,,10,40,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses moral psychology and person perception without clear ties to marketing strategies, tactics, or operational decisions, making it difficult to classify under the provided categories.",scopus-prediction,10,10,Principles of moral accounting: How our intuitive moral sense balances rights and wrongs,2021
"The development of the field of neuromarketing piggybacks on growing interest in the neurosciences associated with the development of new brain imaging technology and recent theorizations of the role played by emotion in consumer decision making. Neuromarketers assert that people's bodies are, for marketing purposes, more truthful than the words they utter, promising direct access to formerly concealed aspects of consumer desire. This article situates the promise to bypass the vagaries of discourse with techniques for reading the body within the broader context of a changing information environment and the forms of reflexive awareness of the partial and constructed character of narrative forms of representation. It explores the uptake by neuromarketers of recent theories that posit emotional responses as integral to the process of rational decision making. This uptake repositions marketers as adjuncts to rational deliberation rather than threats to it and the forms of autonomy and citizenship with which it is associated. However, the article argues that neuromarketers’ claims to bypass mediation and the impasses of representation break down upon further examination. In the end, an examination of the recent literature on the topic indicates that neuromarketers – like data miners – are more interested in potentially useful correlations than in underlying explanations. Their portrayal of neuromarketing as a technique for accessing what consumers’ ‘really’ feel amounts to a misreading of their own project, which might be more properly understood as the development of techniques for making probabilistic predictions about the behaviour of populations. © 2012, Edinburgh University Press.

Findings: The results of the study indicate that, in general, attitude and SI are more important than SN in influencing green purchase intention in a collectivistic country, such as Ghana. Yet, most respondents were neutral in their responses to questions as to whether they are green consumers and/or if they consider themselves to be concerned about environmental issues.

"A significant part of theory in economic geography is founded on the paradigm of economic choice behaviour. Some of its predictions, therefore, must be sensitive to the strong simplifications of this paradigm. This is why it seems useful to identify, discuss and evaluate those simplifications as they exist to-day. Toward this end, we compare models of choice behaviour in economics, including the most recent ones, with a standard paradigm of consumer behaviour in psychology and marketing.
