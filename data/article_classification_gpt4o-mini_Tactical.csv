"An efficient store layout presents merchandise to attract customer attention and encourages customers to walk down more aisles which exposes them to more merchandise, which has been shown to be positively correlated with the sales. It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout. © 2022, The Author(s).",Nguyen K.; Le M.; Martin B.; Cil I.; Fookes C.,Tactical,10.1007/s10462-022-10142-3,Business intelligence; CCTV visual intelligence; Retail layout; Store layout; Video analytic,5.0,,15,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses AI techniques applied to store layout design, which involves structured decisions aimed at improving marketing strategies and customer engagement.

"Learning outcomes: After studying and analyzing this case, students will be able to: understand and evaluate the integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategy for online businesses; understand and create the various components of an IMC plan; determine the challenges of scaling up a business and how social media marketing can help in that; learn how to assemble the positioning statement of a startup; determine and differentiate the different business models (revenue models); and understand and create the social media marketing strategy. Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

"TikTok is increasingly influential in promoting brand awareness and boosting purchase intention. From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users. Limitations and further research suggest that marketers should investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer’s brand awareness-constructing process. © Cuong Nguyen, Thao Tran, Tien Nguyen, 2024.",Nguyen C.; Tran T.; Nguyen T.,Tactical,10.21511/im.20(1).2024.11,brand; e-WOM; entertainment; influencer; interactivity; marketing communications; storytelling; trends,5.0,,15,0,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,"The abstract discusses the factors influencing brand awareness through social media marketing on TikTok, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Objectives: Social media influencers and celebrities have traditionally been utilized by marketers. However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual influencers are gaining popularity on social media platforms. As a result, companies are compelled to incorporate this emerging trend into their social media campaigns. However, there is limited research available regarding the effectiveness criteria of virtual influencers to guide marketers in their selection decisions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attributes of virtual influencers that impact consumer behavioral intentions, specifically within the fashion domain. Methods:. To measure the antecedents to influencing behavioral intentions, 224 online surveys were distributed to female Instagram users selected through convenience sampling method. The empirical design of the study involoved several Instagram posts created as if by a virtual influencer promoting a fictional fashion brand. These posts measured the constructs related to the research questions, drawing from validated digital human and influencer marketing literature. The collected data was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares method. Results: The study findings revealed that content informativeness, bonding, expertise, human like attributes, and consumer innovativeness all had varying degrees of influence on behavioral intentions, with content informativeness being the most influential factor. Conclusions: The study contributes to the limited literature on virtual influencers and provides novel practical implications to marketers. It also suggests the need for further in-depth studies to identify effective attributes of virtual influencers. © 2023 DSR Publishers/ The University of Jordan.",Almasri Y.,Tactical,10.35516/hum.v50i3.5420,AI influencer; CGI influencer; computer generated influencer; fashion influencer marketing; Virtual influencer,5.0,,15,0,"University of Jordan,Deanship of Scientific Research","The study investigates specific attributes of virtual influencers that impact consumer behavioral intentions, which can guide marketers in structuring their social media campaigns effectively.

"Purpose: Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners’ marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers’ decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Lee M.; Kwon W.; Back K.-J.,Tactical,10.1108/IJCHM-06-2020-0587,Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Prediction; Restaurant reviews; Review helpfulness,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on developing and comparing prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning algorithms, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into structured targets such as marketing analytics and customer acquisition.",scopus-ai,10,70,Artificial intelligence for hospitality big data analytics: developing a prediction model of restaurant review helpfulness for customer decision-making,2021
"Purpose: Tags help promote customer engagement on video-sharing platforms. Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Yang Z.; Lin Z.,Tactical,10.1108/INTR-08-2020-0471,Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract describes a video tag recommender system aimed at improving user engagement and decision-making for tagging videos.

"Nowadays, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) play an important role in different functional areas of marketing. Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

"The new business challenges in the B2B sector are determined by connected ecosystems, where data-driven decision making is crucial for successful strategies. At the same time, the use of digital marketing as a communication and sales channel has led to the need and use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to correctly manage company information. The understanding of B2B traditional Marketing strategies that use CRMs that work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been studied, however, research focused on the understanding and application of these technologies in B2B digital marketing is scarce. To cover this gap in the literature, this study develops a literature review on the main academic contributions in this area. To visualize the outcomes of the literature review, the results are then analyzed using a statistical approach known as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) under the homogeneity analysis of variance by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) framework programmed in the R language.

"Marketing is all about finding out what your customers want and need. The information is used to create the model and improve the quality of products and services to satisfy customers. There are two major parts to a sale's planning: containing sales tactics and sales strategy. To aid in business decision-making, a data warehouse (DW) for sales collects and organizes relevant and historical data. DW is also a method for combining data from various heterogeneous databases (DB) and other sources of information for analysis. In this paper, Information analysis for dynamic Sale planning by AI Decision support process was done. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithms have been used to find optimal MVs for sale planning since several authors prove that these algorithms are better than other existing algorithms. MVs selection is based on three factors: time running of MVs, area of MVs, and access frequency of MVs by manipulating the selection result using a weighted combination of each factor as needed by the designer. For PSO, the most cost of frequency was 1.924 for View (V) 11, while for QPSO, it was 1.722 for V11. For PSO, the most cost of time was 1.931 for V2, while for QPSO, it was 1.221 for V22. For PSO, the most cost of the area was 1.800 for V17, while for QPSO, it was 1.071 for V17.

"Understanding how to increase satisfaction and loyalty is of interest to retailers since it has been demonstrated that loyal customers are more profitable than non-loyal ones. The extant literature demonstrated that marketing mix components can affect the satisfaction and loyalty to the retailer. These levers can be divided into two groups: micro (price differentiation, fidelity cards) and macro (price, assortment, private label, services) levers. Among macro ones, price seems to be the most important variable able to influence the selection of a retailer, the level of satisfaction and loyalty. However, customers are not able to judge the real value for money, so it is very important to analyze the perceived price image and to identify the variables on which it depends on. Previous studies have demonstrated that our perceptions, judgments and even preferences are influenced by the way decision problems are framed, so how pricing strategies are communicated is a critical element. This is true, not only for companies that face with final customers but also for wholesalers and, specifically, for Cash and Carry wholesalers, which face with final customers, restaurants and retailers. But, if on one hand, price communication has been deeply investigated in the retailing sector, the same cannot be said for what concerns wholesalers and, in particular, Cash and Carry format. For these reasons, the present work aims to analyze the impact of different ways of price communication can affect customers’ satisfaction and loyalty in the Cash and Carry format, through focus groups methodology, given the novelty of the topic. Findings could help wholesalers to more optimally communicate price promotions in order to better meet the needs of different types of customers and increase the level of satisfaction. © 2019 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated, garnering significant interest among information systems (IS) scholars. AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions.

"The exponential growth of data in the digital age has led to a significant demand for innovative approaches to assess data in a manner that is both effective and efficient. Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a category of services that offers considerable potential for organisations to extract valuable insights from their data while reducing the requirement for heavy technical expertise. This article explores the use of MLaaS within the realm of marketing applications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of MLaaS implementations and their benefits within the domain of marketing. Furthermore, we present a platform that possesses the capability to be customised and expanded to address marketing’s unique requirements. Three modules are introduced: Churn Prediction, One-2-One Product Recommendation, and Send Frequency Prediction. When applied to marketing, the proposed MLaaS system exhibits considerable promise for use in applications such as automated detection of client churn prior to its occurrence, individualised product recommendations, and send time optimisation. Our study revealed that AI-driven campaigns can improve both the Open Rate and Click Rate. This approach has the potential to enhance customer engagement and retention for businesses while enabling well-informed decisions by leveraging insights derived from consumer data.

"The authors develop a multimodal social listening analysis (MSLA) approach as a framework for managers to understand how meaning is constructed in social media posts using both text and other media. The research adds to AI and text analysis approaches by considering the whole meaning of a post rather than an analysis of subsets of information in text and other media. The use of MSLA is validated across the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The findings show that MSLA helps (i) reveal structures in what appear to be unstructured multimodal posts; (ii) identify all the sentiment items in a post; (iii) identify implicit meanings, such as irony, humour and sarcasm; and (iv) further identify emotions and judgements in multimodal communication.

"In recent months, Generative AI-based systems have become increasingly prevalent for public use. Traditionally, people use Google and other search platforms to research a product before purchasing. However, with the integration of ChatGPT into Bing and Google’s announcement of BARD, these models have the potential to impact how customers search for and discover products significantly. This article aims to understand whether people will shift from traditional to Generative AI-based search engines. The research examines the factors influencing purchase decisions and the likelihood of individuals using ChatGPT instead of traditional search engines and other sources. The results indicate that gender, product knowledge, and preference for online or retail store purchases can help predict their inclination to switch to ChatGPT.

"Purpose: This study aims to identify and explore different risk typologies associated with consumer acceptance of purchase recommendations from voice assistants (VAs). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on components of perceived risk, consumer trust theory, and consumption value theory, a research model was proposed and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) with data from 482 voice shoppers. Findings: The results reveal that, unlike risks associated with physical harm, privacy breaches, and security threats, a variety of other concerns—including financial, psychological, social, performance-related risks, time loss, and the overall perceived risks—significantly influence consumers' willingness to accept VAs purchase recommendations. The effect is mediated by trust in VA purchase recommendations and their perceived value. Different types of risk affect various consumption values, with functional value being the most influential. The model explains 58.6% of the variance in purchase recommendation acceptance and significantly elucidates the variance in all consumption values. Originality/value: This study contributes crucial knowledge to understanding consumer decision-making processes as they increasingly leverage AI-powered voice-based dialogue platforms for online purchasing. It emphasizes recognizing diverse risk typologies associated with VA purchase recommendations and their impact on consumer purchase behavior.

"An excessive amount of data is generated daily. A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

"In today’s digital landscape, businesses must allocate online resources efficiently. Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.",Wang T.-C.,Tactical,10.3934/QFE.2024001,customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods,5.0,,15,0,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,"The abstract discusses the development of a revenue optimization model that uses online customer data, applying methods like K-means clustering, CNNs, and LSTMs. These activities are focused on interpreting strategic goals into structured targets, which aligns well with tactical decision-making in marketing, such as advanced targeting and attribution.",scopus-ai,10,70,Deep Learning-Based Prediction and Revenue Optimization for Online Platform User Journeys,2024
"Firms are developing AI-enhanced products (e.g., robots) that can tackle environmental problems through autonomous interactions with their surroundings (e.g., removing waste/pollutants, tracking invasive species) and autonomous learning, which results in improved environmental performance characteristics. Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)",Frank B.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125242,Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics,10.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on how perceived environmental benefits of AI-enhanced products influence consumer purchase intent, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are pervasive in the travel industry and have significantly alleviated solo travelers' concerns in trip planning and booking. However, many existing AI chatbots have yet to meet the expectations of solo travelers, especially when they demand more personalized information to assist in travel decision-making. Based on complexity theory, this research examines the factors that stimulate solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, particularly covering the three main aspects of marketing efforts, communication quality, and affective characteristics. Drawing from a sample of 281 solo travelers, partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used to examine the proposed relationships. The PLS-SEM results illustrate that interaction, entertainment, trendiness, communication competence, and satisfaction have significant direct effects on purchase intentions. The fsQCA results further revealed four solutions exhibiting high purchase intentions among solo travelers. Different core, peripheral, and necessary causal conditions in each configuration path were identified. The findings enrich the AI chatbot literature by examining the underlying reasons why solo travelers react differently to this emerging technology and produce practical recommendations for designing AI chatbot systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Chang J.Y.-S.; Cheah J.-H.; Lim X.-J.; Morrison A.M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.tmp.2023.101191,AI chatbot; fsQCA; PLS-SEM; Purchase intentions; Solo travelers; Tourism,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on specific factors that influence solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"A popular joke amongst marketers is that the best place to hide a dead body is page two of search results. Meaning, nobody looks beyond the first page of search results. In a cookie-free future, search engines double down on how marketers communicate expertise, authority, and trust. This pushes brands to shift away from product-focused search engine marketing, toward an intent-based approach. To stay at the top of search engine results, marketers must understand consumer assessment of search results. Guided by an integrated framework combining UTAUT2, theory of reasoned action, and media richness theory, this empirical study used a 2 (search result type: organic vs. sponsored) × 3 (presentation format: text-only vs. image vs. video) between-subjects research design for assessing the effects of search results on consumer decisions.

"The insurance industry is being challenged by increased adoption of automated decision-making. AI advances could conceivably automate everything: marketing, customer service, underwriting and claims management alike. However, such automation challenges consumer trust, as there is considerable public and scholarly debate over the ‘black box’ character of many algorithms. Insurance being a business of trust, this suggests a dilemma. One suggested solution involves adopting algorithms in a transparent manner. This article reports a study of how Swedish insurers deal with this dilemma, based on (i) eight interviews with insurance professionals representing four companies with a joint market share of 45–50% of the Swedish property insurance market and (ii) a questionnaire answered by 71 professionals in a Swedish insurance company.

"This case stems from a 2019 scenario at Caspar Technologies Pvt. Ltd., a rapidly growing digital marketing and automation service provider in India. CEO Jacob faced concern after presenting to a major client, Pragati, the founder of Villuvia.com, one of India’s top online jewellery brands. While email marketing had been a core strategy since the beginning, its return on investment had dwindled compared to social media advertising, exacerbated by a recent overhaul introducing a new digital marketing team. They excelled in social media but were new to email marketing software. Caspar Technologies unveiled cMercury, an AI-based technology to streamline email marketing campaigns. Although initial tests showed promise, it came at a five-fold cost compared to traditional email management software, which demanded extensive manual intervention. Jacob considered offering Villuvia a discount for the festive season but awaited Pragati’s decision. This would determine whether their budget would be allocated to email marketing, social media, or offline expansion.

"Since neuroscience broke into the field of marketing at the beginning of the 21st century, it has been proven that consumers base a large part of their daily decisions on their feelings, based on stimuli that move them rather than solely relying on conscious and rational factors. The research presents a case analysis of an award-winning Spot that uses artificial intelligence as the basis of the creative idea. Its objective is to assess the extent to which the implementation of this resource is pertinent in eliciting emotions, influencing brand awareness and perception, and fostering a favorable attitude towards the brand. For the analysis, a neuromarketing technique has been used, the Implicit Association Test, complemented with in-depth interviews and a CAWI survey.

"Because of the big volume of marketing data, a human analyst would be unable to uncover any useful information for marketing that could aid in the process of making decision. Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time.

Findings: Marketers make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks. While the adoption of new automatic marketing tools modify the task environment and field of use of traditional decision-making models, the adoption of heuristics rules with a different scope is essential to defining inputs, interpreting/evaluating outputs and control the marketing automation system.

"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of virtual reality experiences (VREs) and emotions on holiday destination visit intentions by applying the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework. It also examined the role of amateur photography as a moderator in the relationship between VREs, emotions and visit intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were collected through a structured survey questionnaire administered in India, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine relationships among variables. The formal survey was preceded by a pilot study. The partial least squares-SEM product indicator technique was applied to measure the moderation effect of amateur photography. Findings: When people have high levels of positive emotions in the pre-travel stage with VRE participation, their intentions to visit destinations are stronger. Amateur photography moderated the relationships between user interactivity, memorable experiences, mental imagery and visit intentions. No significant moderating effect was found between emotional experiences and visit intentions. Practical implications: The results indicate that creators of virtual reality (VR) communications should concentrate on producing interactive and visually striking VR content, as the research found that VR experiences with tourism-related activities have a significant impact on potential visitor emotions. Therefore, VR producers should incorporate authentic and distinctive elements into contents, giving viewers realistic and trustworthy VR tourism experiences. Destination marketers should evoke emotions in people to increase motivations to visit the VR-presented places. Destination marketers should create VR content with hedonic elements, fostering a connection and desire to visit the destination presented in the VR. For example, destination marketers can enhance the sensory aspects of VR content with audio, video, haptics and artificial intelligence, encouraging people to be emotionally captivated and fully immersed. The findings indicate that amateur photography has a significant moderating effect on prospective tourists’ intentions to visit a place presented in VR. Thus, destination marketers are advised to provide photogenic and relevant content to users. By using amateur photography, destinations can market their attractions to potential visitors in a more interactive and relatable manner. Showcasing images taken by amateur photographers presents a genuine perspective of the offerings, thereby increasing visit intentions among prospective visitors. Additionally, amateur photography helps promote the destination in a positive light, emphasizing the attractions and other offerings, and this encourages potential visitors to consider the destination as a travel option, thereby increasing visit intentions. Encouraging amateur photographers to take and share images also increases their engagement with the destination, creating a sense of community and connection and ultimately driving visit intentions. Destination marketers should embrace VR tourism content as a means of promoting their destinations to potential customers by considering the three crucial elements of memorable experiences, emotional experiences and mental imagery. In essence, destination management organizations and other decision makers should develop complete VR communication plans that incorporate interactive and visually striking activities. This can be done by creating VR experiences for prospective tourists, which will enable them to pick their preferred destinations at the pre-travel stage. Through this approach, an effective destination marketing strategy can be established. Originality/value: This research has value in making several potential contributions to the tourism applications of VR. It is the first study to use and test the S-O-R framework to analyse tourist behaviour from the perspective of emotions generated by VR applications. The analysis focuses on India’s tourism market, which has not been explored much in the context of VR and from the perspective of a developing country. The research emphasizes the use of VR as a tool to understand tourist behaviour rather than just focusing on visit intentions. The findings provide valuable insights into the importance of VR in tourism. The knowledge generated will contribute to the understanding of the impact of VR experiences on emotions and visit intentions and the moderating effect of amateur photography.

"Among the many approaches towards fuel economy, the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) may have the greatest impact. However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021",Bas J.; Cirillo C.; Cherchi E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120759,Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the use of Machine Learning techniques to identify key elements in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, which aligns with tactical decision-making by providing structured approaches to target potential EV purchasers.

"In recent years, explainable recommendation has been a topic of active study. This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model. Finally, a multifaceted analysis suggests that the proposed framework is not only effective as an explainable recommendation model but also provides a powerful tool for planning various marketing strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Shimizu R.; Matsutani M.; Goto M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107970,Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Model-intrinsic approach,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the development of an explainable recommendation framework that shows clear applications in marketing strategies and consumer behavior.

"Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

"Purpose: This study aims to explore how social media affects decision-making among tourists and whether there is a potential effect of age, which is studied through generations. For this purpose, baby boomers, Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z tourists are studied and real-time implications are offered. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a descriptive and exploratory design where the conceptual model of social media-based decision-making is developed through a review of the literature. Quantitative analysis is conducted on primary data from 600 Indian tourists. This is done using a self-administered questionnaire adopted from Gulati (2022) after checking its validity and reliability. The statistical analysis for hypothesis testing is done using PLS-SEM path modelling on pooled data. To study the categorical moderating effect of generations, partial least squares multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA) is performed as a paired comparison on every successive generation. Findings: After testing every successive younger generation with an older generation through PLS-MGA, none of the pairs found any significant differences in path coefficients, as the values obtained were 0.05 < p < 0.95 for all five paths (SM → NR, SM → IS, SM → E, SM → P, SM → PPB). This indicates all the generations behave in a similar manner irrespective of them being older or younger, and age does not moderate social media’s impact on decision-making among Indian tourists. Research limitations/implications: The study establishes India as a unique geographical market and suggests tourism marketers to treat all generations at par, irrespective of age, as they behave and interact with social media in a similar manner. But, because this study is restricted to a single geographical location, i.e. India, further regions can be explored for global generalisation. Future research can also explore other demographics for combined, moderated analysis. Findings from the study suggest that marketers should ensure that equal attention is given to all generations as they engage with social media in a similar manner. Targeted marketing using artificial intelligence can help in ensuring custom ads. Personalisation according to generations can also facilitate greater purchases. Originality/value: The study fills a major population and knowledge gap by exploring a topic that has been highly under-researched. Also, the study adopts an inclusive approach by analysing all the generations, both younger and older, to understand the potential effect of age on moderating the impact that social media has on tourist decision-making. Further, real-time suggestions and implications are offered to tourism marketers with special reference to the Indian tourism industry. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Gulati S.,Tactical,10.1108/IDD-11-2022-0115,Generations; India; Social media; Tourist decision-making; User generated content,5.0,,20,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study provides insights into how different generations engage with social media for decision-making in tourism, implying a structured approach for marketers to target various demographic groups effectively.

"Purpose: This study evaluates the effect of the media image content of business to business (B2B) organizations to accelerate social media engagement. It highlights the importance of strategically designing image content for business marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study designed a computation extensive research model based upon the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory using 39,139 Facebook posts of 125 organizations selected from Fortune 500 firms. Attributes from images and text were estimated using deep learning models. Subsequently, inferential analysis was established with ordinary least squares regression. Further machine learning algorithms, like support vector regression, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree and random forest, are used to analyze the significance and robustness of the proposed model for predicting engagement metrics. Findings: The results indicate that the social media (SM) image content of B2B firms significantly impacts their social media engagement. The visual and linguistic attributes are extracted from the image using deep learning. The distinctive effect of each feature on social media engagement (SME) is empirically verified in this study. Originality/value: This research presents practical insights formulated by embedding marketing, advertising, image processing and statistical knowledge of SM analytics. The findings of this study provide evidence for the stimulating effect of image content concerning SME.

"Online product reviews are ubiquitous and helpful sources of information available to consumers for making purchase decisions. Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research. © 2022",Carlson K.; Kopalle P.K.; Riddell A.; Rockmore D.; Vana P.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.02.004,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Online reviews; Review synthesis; Wine reviews,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the application of AI in writing online product reviews, which aligns with marketing analytics and creative optimization, indicating a focus on structured decision-making with clear boundaries.",scopus-artificial intelligence,10,70,Complementing human effort in online reviews: A deep learning approach to automatic content generation and review synthesis,2023
"In the current phase of artificial intelligence development, more and more attention is being paid to technologies that make autonomous decisions. Little attention has been paid to the customers’ and job seekers’ perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers’ attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers’ intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital’s unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies.

"Today, the use of machine learning technology in combination with the use of big data are topics that are actively discussed in business around the world. This topic has long gone beyond the information sphere, as it now applies to almost every sphere of life: economic, telecommunications, education, medicine, administration, and especially defense. Predicting customer behavior based on scoring models is in its infancy in Ukrainian companies, the main ones being the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning, which will be the leading catalyst that will facilitate decision-making in business in the nearest future. The aim of the study is to develop a scoring model that predicts the behavior of target segments, namely, updating their activity to activate advertising tools.

"The use of machine learning (ML) methods has been widely discussed for over a decade. The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

"An understudied area in the field of social media research is the design of decision support systems that can aid the manager by way of automated message component generation. Recent advances in this form of artificial intelligence has been suggested to allow content creators and managers to transcend their tasks from creation towards editing, thus overcoming a common problem: the tyranny of the blank screen. In this research, we address this topic by proposing a novel system design that will suggest engagement-driven message features as well as automatically generate critical and fully written unique Tweet message components for the goal of maximizing the probability of relatively high engagement levels. Our multi-methods design relies on the use of econometrics, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics, all of which are widely used in the emerging fields of Business and Marketing Analytics.

"Objective: To study the relevance of Instagram posts in the construction of forecasting models for the variation of daily sales revenues for retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Methodology: Time series of daily sales between the years 2017 and 2019 of 10 retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector were considered. Methods based on machine learning were used and the forecasting models were increased with numerical variables from the official profile of the company, from the posting made by the contracted digital influencer and the characteristics of the images posted by the digital influencer were included in the models. Relevance and Originality: The study is innovative, as it goes beyond qualitative reflections on the theme and provides empirical evidence regarding the impacts on forecast accuracy from the inclusion of social media variables. A data fusion strategy (numerics and images) was also presented to forecast daily sales of retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Main results: The models proved to be efficient in forecasting and the importance of the likes and engagement variables reinforces the idea that the identification and social reference generated by the ID are important aspects in the purchase decision process. It was found that the images are responsible for adding exclusive attributes that help in forecasting and understanding the patterns of the sales series.

"In the wake of the global disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, digital channels have emerged as a significant driver of business sales. As such, the value of digital business management has received considerable attention from industrial practitioners. Beyond conventional promotion techniques, collaboration with digital market influencers has shown significant potential for business organisations by creating a circle of trust. However, managing influencers in the business-to-business market is far more complex than in business-to-consumer markets, as it involves balancing business processes, competitive advantages, company image and risks rather than solely motivating customer engagement. It is, therefore, critical for organisations to carefully select key opinion leaders (KOLs). To address this challenge, this study introduces an intelligent multi-criteria KOL analytics framework that embeds the fuzzy best-worst method and the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. The framework converts subjective and linguistic criteria, determines the attribute most relevant to the business, and then selects the most suitable KOLs for the campaign. A case study was conducted in partnership with a digital marketing agency in Hong Kong to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this approach. This model facilitates the evolution of digital business management by systematically identifying and assessing KOLs, contributing to significant changes in the digital business environment for companies. © 2024 The Authors",Lam H.Y.; Tang V.; Wu C.H.; Cho V.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jik.2024.100502,Artificial intelligence; Business-to-business; Digital business management; Key opinion leaders; Multi-criteria decision-making,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of an intelligent multi-criteria KOL analytics framework, which is focused on selecting key opinion leaders for marketing campaigns.

"The insurance sector plays a crucial role in fostering sustainable economic development within a country. As the customer base grows, insurance companies must prioritize transitioning to data-driven strategies to cut costs and make more informed marketing choices in today's digital era. This study proposes a new decision-making framework for precision marketing, based on a real case study from a Moroccan insurance company that aims to solve a practical problem. The proposed decision-making system consists of four components, with each component involving important steps. Firstly, data preparation was performed, consisting of four critical stages: data acquisition, data cleaning and filtering, feature selection, and oversampling. Secondly, top 20% and top 50% consumers are taken as examples to present their customer persona in detail. Based on the processed data, we analysed consumer consumption behaviors using four ML algorithms and made a performance comparison of the four algorithms. Additionally, we conducted feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features and evaluate the system's performance. The aim of the proposed precision decision-making system is to assist managers in discerning the distinctive characteristics of potential customers and proposing tailored precision marketing strategies. This approach is expected to substantially reduce advertising expenses and enhance overall marketing efficiency.

"Purpose: Artificial Intelligence-based smart farming technologies have brought impressive changes in farming. This paper aims at exploring the farmers’ intention to adopt smart farming technologies (SFT). Also, the authors intend to know how far the belief of farmers on land as God influences their decision to adopt SFT. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from 500 farmers chosen purposively. A well-crafted survey instrument was employed to amass data from farmers for measuring their adoption of SFT. As the authors sought to measure the farmers’ behavioural intention (BI) towards the adoption of SFT, the technology acceptance model developed by Davis (1989) came in handy, including perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and BI. The authors have adopted this model as it was considered a superior model. The items on the attitude of confidence (AC) were adapted from Adrian et al. (2005). Survey instruments of Thompson and Higgins (1991) and Compeau and Higgins (1995) were also referred to finalize the statements relating to attitude towards use. Moreover, the authors developed items relating to the perceived belief of land as God based on frequent interaction with the farmers. Findings: The study results divulged that attitude to use (AU) is directly influenced by the rural farmers’ PU, PEU and AC. Similarly, this investigation has observed behaviour intention directly influenced by the AU of farmers. It is observed that AU was the most influential variable, which ultimately influenced the BI to use SFT. Research limitations/implications: This study has an important limitation in the form of representing only the culture, belief and value system of farmers in India. Practical implications: The outcome of this study will facilitate the policymakers to draw suitable policy measures keeping the sensitivities of the farmers in mind in their technology adoption drive. The agricultural officers can encourage farmers to take logical decisions by supplying adequate information in a time-bound manner. Marketers can make suitable adjustments in their sales and promotion activities that focus on farmers. Social implications: The belief of farmers on land as God has a small yet unmissable influence on farmers’ AU and BI in their technology adoption decision.

"As the World Wide Web has developed considerable bargaining power has been transferred from suppliers to consumers; there is a real need to improve market intelligence and market research for private and public tourism organisations and facilitate timely consumer decision making. This article explores the development of user generated content and specifically the use of web logs or blogs. Tourism organisations cannot afford to ignore the development of user generated content, peer-to-peer web applications and virtual communities. A recent survey found that consumers trusted more websites with reviews than professional guides and travel agencies and far from being an irrelevance, blogs are often perceived to be more credible and trustworthy than traditional marketing communications. But there is a problem: given the sheer number of possibly relevant travel blogs there is a need to locate, extract and interpret blog content and this has proven so far to be time consuming, exhausting and costly, thus negating the relative value of the information obtained. A way forward may be the use of artificial intelligence and ""opinion mining"" or a blog visualisation system.",Akehurst G.,Tactical,10.1007/s11628-008-0054-2,Blogs; Internet; Marketing; Tourism; Travel; User generated content,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the need for tourism organizations to effectively utilize user-generated content and blogs to enhance market intelligence and consumer decision-making, indicating a focus on operational targets and structured decision-making processes.",scopus-artificial intelligence,10,70,User generated content: The use of blogs for tourism organisations and tourism consumers,2009
"Purpose: While the motivation for collecting art has received considerable attention in the literature, less is known about the characteristics of the typical art collector. This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating the “doubling” procedure to deal with percentile data. Practical implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of art collectors that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating a non-traditional application of correspondence analysis using the “doubling” procedure. Buyer behavior in the fine art market is not exhaustively studied. By understanding the personality traits of consumers in the art market, sales forces can better provide assistance and product to consumers. Further, understanding the personalities of consumers is better for art retail spaces to better serve consumers.

"Global supply chains reduce cost but increase lead times, complexities and uncertainties. Retailers in consumer products industry are getting shorter lead time to respond to market demand. To meet this challenge, many rely on third party supply chain managers (SCMs) for economically supplying required quantities of finished products quickly. However, due to shorter time to market, the SCM has to procure raw materials and start production process based on expected demand. Since SCM absorbs financial penalties associated with under-and over-estimation of demand from retailer, finding an optimal production lot size and product customisation strategy are essential to an SCM's operation. We develop a profit maximisation model and provide a close-form solution that allows an SCM to calculate optimal production lot size. The model is used to examine profitability of postponing product customisation. Finally, the effect of demand variation on SCM's profitability is explored. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Banerjee S.; Golhar D.Y.,Tactical,10.1080/09537287.2011.639586,customisation postponement; decision support system; demand uncertainty; supply chain manager,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses optimizing production lot sizes and product customization strategies, which are tactical decisions related to managing supply chain operations and responding to market demands.

"When customers journey from a need to a purchase decision and beyond, they rarely do so alone. This article introduces the social customer journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by explicitly integrating the important role that social others play throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of “traveling companions,” who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages.

"The main purpose in influence maximization, which is motivated by the idea of viral marketing in social networks, is to find a subset of key users that maximize influence spread under a certain propagation model. A number of studies have been done over the past few years that try to solve this problem by considering a non-adversarial environment in which there exists only one player with no competitor. However, in real world scenarios, there is always more than one player competing with other players to influence the most nodes. This is called competitive influence maximization. Motivated by this, we try to solve the competitive influence maximization problem by proposing a new propagation model which is an extension of the Linear Threshold model and gives decision-making ability to nodes about incoming influence spread. We also propose an efficient algorithm for finding the influential nodes in a given social graph under the proposed propagation model which exploits the community structure of this graph to compute the spread of each node locally within its own community. The aim of our algorithm is to find the minimum number of seed nodes which can achieve higher spread in comparison with the spread achieved by nodes selected by other competitor. Our experiments on real world and synthetic datasets show that our approach can find influential nodes in an acceptable running time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bozorgi A.; Samet S.; Kwisthout J.; Wareham T.,Tactical,10.1016/j.knosys.2017.07.029,Community detection; Competitive influence maximization; Influence maximization; Linear threshold model; Social network,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses an algorithm for competitive influence maximization in social networks, focusing on finding influential nodes within a community.

"A framework for developing marketing category management decision support systems (DSS) based upon the Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) model is extended. Since the BVAR model is vulnerable to permanent and temporary shifts in purchasing patterns over time, a form that can correct for the shifts and still provide the other advantages of the BVAR is a Bayesian Vector Error-Correction Model (BVECM). We present the mechanics of extending the DSS to move from a BVAR model to the BVECM model for the category management problem. Several additional iterative steps are required in the DSS to allow the decision maker to arrive at the best forecast possible.

"In many important settings, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to a stimulus or ""treatment."" For instance, a treatment that works for the overall population might be highly ineffective, or even harmful, for a subgroup of subjects with specific characteristics. Similarly, a new treatment may not be better than an existing treatment in the overall population, but there is likely a subgroup of subjects who would benefit from it. The notion that ""one size may not fit all"" is becoming increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from economics to medicine. This has drawn significant attention to personalize the choice of treatment, so it is optimal for each individual. An optimal personalized treatment is the one that maximizes the probability of a desirable outcome. We call the task of learning the optimal personalized treatment personalized treatment learning. From the statistical learning perspective, this problem imposes important challenges, primarily because the optimal treatment is unknown on a given training set. A number of statistical methods have been proposed recently to tackle this problem. However, considering the critical importance of these methods to decision support systems, personalized treatment learning models have received relatively little attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method labeled causal conditional inference trees and its natural extension to causal conditional inference forests. The performance of the new method is analyzed and compared to alternative methods for personalized treatment learning. The results show that our new proposed method often outperforms the alternatives on the numerical settings described in this article.

"Viral marketing refers to marketing techniques that use social networks to produce increases in brand awareness through self-replicating viral diffusion of messages, analogous to the spread of pathological and computer viruses. The idea has successfully been used by marketers to reach a large number of customers rapidly. If data about the customer network is available, centrality measures provide a structural measure that can be used in decision support systems to select influencers and spread viral marketing campaigns in a customer network. Usage stimulation and churn management are examples of DSS applications, where centrality of customers does play a role. The literature on network theory describes a large number of such centrality measures. A critical question is which of these measures is best to select an initial set of customers for a marketing campaign, in order to achieve a maximum dissemination of messages. In this paper, we present the results of computational experiments based on call data from a telecom company to compare different centrality measures for the diffusion of marketing messages.

"Customization and personalization services are a critical success factor for Internet stores and Web service providers. This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules for personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique for personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store.

"Customer lifetime value (CLV) has received increasing attention in database marketing. Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Tsai C.-F.; hu Y.-H.; Hung C.-S.; Hsu Y.-F.,Tactical,10.1108/03684921311323626,Customer information; Customer lifetime value; Data mining; Database marketing; Hybrid models; Machine learning,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the implementation and comparison of hybrid models for predicting customer lifetime value (CLV), which falls under tactical decision-making as it relates to structured approaches in marketing analytics and customer acquisition.",scopus-artificial intelligence,10,70,A comparative study of hybrid machine learning techniques for customer lifetime value prediction,2013

"Emerging technologies in online commerce, mobile and customer experience have transformed the retail industry so as to enable the marketers to boost sales and the customers with the most efficient online shopping. Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance.

"Bank agencies daily store a huge volume of data regarding clients and their operations. This information, in turn, can be used for marketing purposes to acquire new clients or sell products to existing clients. A Decision Support System (DSS) can help a manager to decide the sequence of clients to contact to reach a designed target. In this paper we present the BIG CHASE, a DSS that translates bank data into a reliability graph. This graph models relationships based on a probability of traversal function that includes social measures. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with Banco Santander, S.A., fits the parameters of the probability function to explicit solution evaluations given by experts by means of a specifically designed Projected Gradient Descent algorithm. The fitted probability function determines the reliabilities associated to the edges of the graph. An optimization procedure tailored to be efficient on very large sparse graphs with millions of nodes and edges identifies the most reliable sequence of clients that a manager should contact to reach a specific target.

"It can be expensive to acquire the data required for businesses to employ data-driven predictive modeling - for example, to model consumer preferences to optimize targeting. Prior research has introduced ""active-learning"" policies for identifying data that are particularly useful for model induction, with the goal of decreasing the statistical error for a given acquisition cost (error-centric approaches). However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly. We also show that this method is robust in the face of decreasing quality of utility estimations, eventually converging to uniform random sampling, and that it can be extended to situations where different data acquisitions have different costs. The results suggest that businesses should consider modifying their strategies for acquiring information through normal business transactions. For example, a firm such as Amazon.com that models consumer preferences for customized marketing may accelerate learning by proactively offering recommendations - not merely to induce immediate sales, but for improving recommendations in the future. © 2007 INFORMS.",Saar-Tsechansky M.; Provost F.,Tactical,10.1287/isre.1070.0111,Active learning; Classifier induction; Decision making; Decision-support systems; Predictive modeling,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a new decision-centric approach to active data acquisition, which emphasizes how data acquisition affects decision-making in marketing contexts.

"Customer relationship management (CRM) aims to build relations with the most profitable clients by performing customer segmentation and designing appropriate marketing tools. In addition, customer profitability accounting (CPA) recommends evaluating the CRM program through the combination of partial measures in a global costĝ€""benefit function.

As an alternative, decision trees are machine learning models that do not consider a priori hypotheses, achieve a high performance, and generate logical rules clearly understood by managers.

"Mobile value added services has emerged as one of the significant revenue generators for the mobile telecommunication industry. With the large array of service offerings, telecom providers engage in active advertising of service bundles to attract new as well as retain the existing customers. Focused advertising by personalising the service bundles based on individual customer preferences is a key success factor of such campaigns. This paper proposes the application of a neural network-based decision support model for pattern association using which mixed bundles of such services may be identified, as per customer preferences, so as to induce higher conversion in cross-sales and up-sales. Consumer service preferences can be combined with some standard packages of VAS bundles to personalise the service bundles and these service bundles would be generated dynamically. Identifying and promoting such services identified through pattern association rules will have a direct impact on the overall profitability of the service provider.

"Innovative methods of artificial intelligence such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been increasingly adopted to predict consumer responses to direct marketing. However, appropriate learning algorithms, evaluation criteria, and validation procedures are necessary for effective implementation of neural networks to provide decision support to managers. This study compares the performance of Bayesian neural networks with that of logistic regression and the backpropagation method in modelling consumer responses. The results of a ten-fold stratified cross-validation suggest that although the three methods perform equally well under the error rate, Bayesian neural networks generate higher statistics for the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and cumulative lifts. The findings suggest that researchers should adopt effective learning algorithms, relevant evaluation criteria and appropriate validation procedures for neural networks to model consumer responses and solve marketing problems facing today's businesses.",Cui G.; Wong M.L.,Tactical,10.1177/147078530404600204,,5.0,,15,0,Market Research Society,"The abstract discusses the performance of different methods (Bayesian neural networks, logistic regression, and backpropagation) in modeling consumer responses to direct marketing, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and customer acquisition strategies.",scopus-artificial intelligence,10,70,Implementing neural networks for decision support in direct marketing,2004
Goal programming (GP) is an important technique for solving many practice applications. This paper adopts multi-choice goal programming model (MCGP) approach to solve a multi-objectives decision-making problem. The decision model is developed as a multi-choice aspiration levels goal programming model base on a case study. The overall objective is to select an effective resource distribution in a knowledge management system (KMS) projects selection process. The main contribution of this work is development a mathematical model for KMS project evaluate and selection. The advantage of this method is that it allows decision makers to set multi-objective aspiration levels for KMS selection problems. The MCGP model facilitates decision-making process in business resources planning. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Manufacturers of consumer goods need to see the market situation and end customer demand in order to efficiently allocate production capacity and procure materials. However, the difficulty to obtain timely and accurate demand data from the point-of-sales (POS) calls for alternative solutions to be developed. This paper presents a solution that is based on readily available sell-through data from channel partners, such as distributors, to monitor what happens on the market in product introduction situations. The difficulty with using demand information from distributors rather than the POS is the bullwhip effect that distorts demand as you move upstream in the supply chain.

"The basis of the modern marketing of a business entity is to know the behavior of its customers. Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior. To reach the main goal we perform a data analysis of the online sales data by using machine learning methods as clustering, decision tree and association rules mining. After evaluating the proposed model, we discuss its use of the proposed model in the field of internet sales in the agricultural sector.; JEL Classification: C53, D11, D91, M21, M31 © 2020",Exenberger E.; Bucko J.,Tactical,10.7160/AOL.2020.120302,association rules; Classification; consumer behavior; data analysis; online shopping,5.0,,20,0,Faculty of Economics and Management,"The abstract focuses on applying advanced AI methods like data mining and machine learning to analyze online customer behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"In many categories consumers display cyclical buying: they repeatedly purchase in the category for several periods, followed by several periods of not buying. We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of crosscategory substitution by the consumer, caused by ""variety-seeking"" tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high versus low purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3% households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions-customized timing of price reductions. © 2011 INFORMS.",Park S.; Gupta S.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1110.0643,Brand choice; Endogeneity; Heterogeneity; Logit model; Random coefficients; Scanner data; Simulated maximum likelihood,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses a model for understanding consumer purchasing behavior and its implications for marketing strategies, particularly in terms of timing price promotions to enhance sales.

"The authors explore product category and customer characteristics that affect consumers' likelihood of engaging In unplanned purchases. In addition, they examine consumer activities that can exacerbate or limit these effects. The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46%, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93%.

"Previous research on charitable giving has devoted little attention to the fundamental question of how consumers actually respond to charitable donation requests via direct mail. Specifically, researchers have relied on the untested assumption that consumers engage in fairly extensive evaluations of requests. The present research challenges this assumption. By means of a simple scenario-technique, cognitive and behavioural responses to donation requests were first elicited from a sample of 90 consumers. A qualitative constant comparative analysis of responses resulted in the discovery of three different donor categories with different styles of decision-making: analysts (ANA), relationists (REL) and internalists (INT). ANA were characterised by high involvement and thorough evaluations of both the organisation behind a request and the specific cause promoted. REL were loyal to specific organisations and seldom attended to other information than the organisation behind the request. Interestingly, consumers in the final category, INT, neither evaluated the organisation nor the cause promoted. For these consumers, recognition of the requesting organisation was usually enough to trigger a positive response. In a follow-up survey including responses from more than 400 consumers, the typology of response styles was further explored and validated. In line with predictions from study 1, significant differences were observed in the ways ANA, REL and INT perceive, evaluate and give money to charitable organisations. The findings offer important implications for consumer psychology, public policy and charity marketing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Supphellen M.; Nelson M.R.,Tactical,10.1016/S0167-4870(01)00056-3,3920; 3940; Charity marketing; Decision making; Fund raising; L3; M3; Non-profit organisations,5.0,,15,0,,"The research offers insights into how consumers respond to charitable donation requests, providing an understanding that can directly influence marketing strategies and campaigns.

"Previous research has focused primarily on affect generated from counterfactual thinking after decisions have been made. The current study, in contrast, examined how predecision mental simulations (prefactuals) and feelings of anticipated regret are affected by different marketing strategies. A preliminary investigation found that consumers frequently produce upward prefactuals (e.g., if I buy it today and find it for less next week, I'll regret my purchase) when considering a major purchase. It was hypothesized that providing price guarantees would reduce upward prefactual generation and reduce anticipated regret. The primary investigation supported these predictions. When price guarantees were available, prefactuals were more downward in direction and negative affect was reduced. Also, price guarantees increased long-term satisfaction and happiness even when they were not exercised.

"We develop a testing methodology that can be used to predict the performance of e-mail marketing campaigns in real time. We propose a split-hazard model that makes use of a time transformation (a concept we call virtual time) to allow for the estimation of straightforward parametric hazard functions and generate early predictions of an individual campaign's performance (as measured by open and click propensities). We apply this pretesting methodology to 25 e-mail campaigns and find that the method is able to produce in an hour and fifteen minutes estimates that are more accurate and more reliable than those that the traditional method (doubling time) produces after 14 hours. Other benefits of our method are that we make testing independent of the time of day and we produce meaningful confidence intervals. Thus, our methodology can be used not only for testing purposes, but also for live monitoring. The testing procedure is coupled with a formal decision theoretic framework to generate a sequential testing procedure useful for the real time evaluation of campaigns.© 2009 informs.",Bonfrer A.; Drèze X.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1080.0393,Advertising campaigns; Database marketing; E-mail; Pretesting,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract describes a methodology for predicting the performance of email marketing campaigns, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Kim J.; Rao R.S.; Kim K.; Rao A.R.,Tactical,10.1509/jmkr.48.1.157,Analytical models; Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Pricing; Trade-ins,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses consumer preferences in trade-in transactions, which relates to decision-making processes that are more structured and target-oriented, fitting within the tactical level of marketing decisions.",scopus-prediction,10,70,More or less: A model and empirical evidence on preferences for under- and overpayment in trade-in transactions,2011
"The objective of the present research is to study consumer decisions to utilize a line of credit. The life-cycle hypothesis from economics argues that consumers should intertemporally reallocate their incomes over their life stream to maximize lifetime utility. One form of intertemporal allocation is to use past income (in the form of savings) in the future. A second form is the use of future income in the present. This can only be done if consumers have access to a temporary pool of money that they can draw from and replenish in the future - a function performed by consumer credit. However, our research reinforces prior findings that consumers are unable to correctly value their future incomes, and that they lack the cognitive capability to solve the intertemporal optimization problem required by the life-cycle hypothesis. Instead, we argue that consumers use information such as the credit limit as a signal of their future earnings potential. Specifically, if consumers have access to large amounts of credit, they are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be high and hence their willingness to use credit (and their spending) will also be high. Conversely, consumers who are granted lower amounts of credit are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be low and hence their spending will be lower. However, based on research in the area of consumer skepticism and inference making, we also argue for a moderating role of the credibility associated with the credit limit. Specifically, we argue that the above effect of credit availability would be particularly strong for consumers who believe that the credit limit credibly signals their future earnings potential (i.e., a naïve consumer who has limited experience with consumer credit). However, as consumers gain experience with credit, they start discounting credit availability as a predictor of their future and start questioning the validity of the process used to set the credit limit. Hence, with experience the effect of credit limit on the willingness to use credit should be attenuated. We test these predictions in five separate studies. In the first experimental study, we manipulate credit limit and credibility and pose subjects with a hypothetical purchase opportunity. Consistent with our prediction, credit limit impacted the propensity to spend, but only when the credibility was high. In the second experimental study, we replicate these findings even when subjects were given information about their expected future salaries, and also show that the credit limit influences their expectation of future earnings potential. In the third study, we show that the mere availability (and increase) of current liquidity cannot explain our findings. In the fourth study, we conduct a survey of consumers in which we measure a number of demographic characteristics and also ask them for their propensity to spend in a given purchase situation. In the fifth study we use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset, a triennial survey of U.S. families that is designed to provide detailed information on the use of financial services, spending behaviors, and selected demographic characteristics. Results from both studies 4 and 5 provide further support for our proposed framework-credit limits influence spending to a greater extent for consumers with lower credibility: younger consumers and less-educated consumers. Across all studies we achieved triangulation by using a variety of approaches (surveys and experiments), subjects types (young students and older consumers), nature of predictor variables (manipulated and measured), dependent measures (purchase likelihood, credit card balance, new charges), and methods of analysis (ANOVA and regression), and consistently found that increasing credit limits on a credit card increases spending, especially when the credibility of the limit is high. This paper joins a growing body of literature in marketing and behavioral decision theory that goes beyond the traditional domains of inquiry (e.g., product choice, effects of marketing mix variables) and focuses on consumer decisions relating to the appropriate use of income to finance consumption. Our framework differs from prior research on the effect of payment mechanisms on spending in two significant ways. First, we are interested in the effects of the availability of credit on spending, and not necessarily in the effect of the transaction format that is associated with each payment mechanism. Second, while prior research has studied the point-of-purchase and historic (i.e., prepurchase) effects of credit, the present research is concerned with the availability of credit in the future. Specifically, our framework is invariant to the current and prior usage of credit by the consumer.",Soman D.; Cheema A.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.21.1.32.155,,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The research focuses on the specific consumer decisions related to the utilization of credit and how credit limits influence spending behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-prediction,10,70,The effect of credit on spending decisions: The role of the credit limit and credibility,2002
"Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be ""realistic"" in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or ""base-case"" scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base-case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base-case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because defining the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base-case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment. © 2008 INFORMS.",Gilbride T.J.; Lenk P.J.; Brazell J.D.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1080.0369,Bayesian decision theory; Conjoint analysis; Constrained optimization; Cross-validation; Hierarchical bayes; Loss function; Market share prediction; Penalized maximum likelihood; Posterior risk,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporate base-case market shares into conjoint analysis, which aligns with structured decision-making processes and targets related to marketing analytics and consumer preferences.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Market share constraints and the loss function in choice-based conjoint analysis,2008
"Widely available web 2.0 technologies not only bring rich and interactive user experiences, but also easily help users advertise products or services on their own blogs and social network webpages. Online referral marketing, for example, is a business practice that rewards customers who successfully refer other customers to a website or upon completion of a sale usually via their own social contacts. The referral rewards come in different forms such as shopping vouchers, redeemable points, discounts, prizes, cash payments, etc. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the business potential of incorporating an online referral marketing program into the firm's product selling strategies. Under different demand dynamics, we investigate the optimal decision making including the pricing and referral strategies to maximize the seller's profitability. We find that, under simple decision making environment such as fixed product price and myopic strategy, different demand dynamics yield the same prediction of the referral payment, which turns out to be a static policy. However, under complex market situations, both the optimal product pricing and referral offering critically depend on the demand side dynamics. Under the nonlinear demand dynamics, the referral payment is an all-or-nothing decision throughout the product selling horizon. In contrast, under the linear demand assumption, the referral payment can be partially offered in initial phase of the product introduction. We further offer some managerial insights to guide practical implementation of the online referral marketing strategy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"In spite of the high financial stakes involved in marketing new motion pictures, marketing science models have not been applied to the prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures. The motion picture industry poses some unique challenges. For example, the consumer adoption process for movies is very sensitive to word-of-mouth interactions, which are difficult to measure and predict before the movie has been released. In this article, we undertake the challenge to develop and implement MOVIEMOD - a prerelease market evaluation model for the motion picture industry. MOVIEMOD is designed to generate box-office forecasts and to support marketing decisions for a new movie after the movie has been produced (or when it is available in a rough cut) but before it has been released. Unlike other forecasting models for motion pictures, the calibration of MOVIEMOD does not require any actual sales data. Also, the data collection time for a product with a limited lifetime such as a movie should not take too long. For MOVIEMOD it takes only three hours in a ""consumer clinic"" to collect the data needed for the prediction of box-office sales and the evaluation of alternative marketing plans. The model is based on a behavioral representation of the consumer adoption process for movies as a macroflow process. The heart of MOVIEMOD is an interactive Markov chain model describing the macro-flow process. According to this model, at any point in time with respect to the movie under study, a consumer can be found in one of the following behavioral states: undecided, considerer, rejecter, positive spreader, negative spreader, and inactive. The progression of consumers through the behavioral states depends on a set of movie-specific factors that are related to the marketing mix, as well as on a set of more general behavioral factors that characterize the movie-going behavior in the population of interest. This interactive Markov chain model allows us to account for word-of-mouth interactions among potential adopters and several types of word-of-mouth spreaders in the population. Marketing variables that influence the transitions among the states are movie theme acceptability, promotion strategy, distribution strategy, and the movie experience. The model is calibrated in a consumer clinic experiment. Respondents fill out a questionnaire with general items related to their movie-going and movie communication behavior, they are exposed to different sets of information stimuli, they are actually shown the movie, and finally, they fill out postmovie evaluations, including word-of-mouth intentions. These measures are used to estimate the word-of-mouth parameters and other behavioral factors, as well as the movie-specific parameters of the model. MOVIEMOD produces forecasts of the awareness, adoption intention, and cumulative penetration for a new movie within the population of interest for a given base marketing plan. It also provides diagnostic information on the likely impact of alternative marketing plans on the commercial performance of a new movie. We describe two applications of MOVIEMOD: One is a pilot study conducted without studio cooperation in the United States, and the other is a full-fledged implementation conducted with cooperation of the movie's distributor and exhibitor in the Netherlands. The implementations suggest that MOVIEMOD produces reasonably accurate forecasts of box-office performance. More importantly, the model offers the opportunity to simulate the effects of alternative marketing plans. In the Dutch application, the effects of extra advertising, extra magazine articles, extra TV commercials, and higher trailer intensity (compared to the base marketing plan of the distributor) were analyzed. We demonstrate the value of these decision-support capabilities of MOVIEMOD in assisting managers to identify a final plan that resulted in an almost 50% increase in the test movie's revenue performance, compared to the marketing plan initially contemplated. Management implemented this recommended plan, which resulted in box-office sales that were within 5% of the MOVIEMOD prediction. MOVIEMOD was also tested against several benchmark models, and its prediction was better in all cases. An evaluation of MOVIEMOD jointly by the Dutch exhibitor and the distributor showed that both parties were positive about and appreciated its performance as a decision-support tool. In particular, the distributor, who has more stakes in the domestic performance of its movies, showed a great interest in using MOVIEMOD for subsequent evaluations of new movies prior to their release. Based on such evaluations and the initial validation results, MOVIEMOD can fruitfully (and inexpensively) be used to provide researchers and managers with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive audience response to new motion pictures, and it can be instrumental in developing other decision-support systems that can improve the odds of commercial success of new experiential products.",Eliashberg J.; Jonker J.-J.; Sawhney M.S.; Wierenga B.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.19.3.226.11796,Decision support; Forecasting; Markov chains; Motion pictures; New products; Pretest market evaluation,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract describes a model (MOVIEMOD) designed for prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures, which supports marketing decisions and forecasts box-office performance.

"Internet retailing offers merchants limitless shelf space. This has led experts to highlight the existence of a ""long tail"" of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is ""selling less of more."" However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Schwartz and his colleagues have proposed individual differences in consumer decision goals. Maximizers are those who always strive to make the best possible decision, whereas satisficers are those who are usually willing to settle for a ""good enough"" option. In this study, we explore the influence of the maximizing trait in situations where consumers have to make quick purchase decisions. The context for our empirical study is online gift purchases made under a time constraint. The results support our predictions that maximizers (vs. satisficers) engage in more prepurchase browsing behavior and also perceive more decision time pressure. Furthermore, these effects are moderated by the size of the available choice assortment. The results also show that maximizers are more likely to change their initial time-constrained choices if given the opportunity to do so. We discuss the implications of the research for the study of individual differences in consumer behavior and also for customizing retail sales and Internet marketing tactics based on buyer segmentation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Chowdhury T.G.; Ratneshwar S.; Mohanty P.,Tactical,10.1007/s11002-008-9063-0,Assortment size; Browsing behavior; Consumer decision making; Maximizing trait; Time pressure,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior in decision-making processes, particularly in the context of online gift purchases under time constraints.

"We examine the key factors that influence a firm's decision whether to use front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives. When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage. The data in both studies are consistent with the model predictions.",Zhang Z.J.; Krishna A.; Dhar S.K.,Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.46.3.348.12062,,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses specific promotional strategies (front-loaded vs rear-loaded incentives) and their impacts on sales and profitability, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-prediction,15,65,Optimal choice of promotional vehicles: front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives?,2000
"Walking the path from new product concept to successful commercialization is a tightrope act. Product developers must carefully balance a variety of factors, including predictions of consumer price sensitivity as well as which combination of product attributes will be most valued by the intended market. A well-chosen mix of analytical tools can enhance a firm's chances of accurately predicting market demand. Chuck Tomkovick and Kathryn E. Dobie describe how the integration of two product attribute assessment techniques-hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys-allows product designer to more accurately gauge price sensitivity and market receptivity to new product designs. They also describe how these analytical tools were used to improve decision-making in product development at the Parker Pen Company, and they discuss the role these tools can play in facilitating the transition from concept to commercialization. Hedonic price analysis is an econometric method for determining the value purchasers place on attributes of existing products. In product development, factorial surveys are used to identify the value members of the target market place on new product concepts and prototypes. When used in combination with identified hedonic prices, the responses to a factorial survey allow product developers to predict consumer willingness-to-pay for various combinations of new product attributes. Following development of prototypes for two new product lines, product developers at the Parker Pen Company used hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys as a means for reducing demand uncertainty and for clarifying what consumers were willing to pay for various combinations of product attributes that were under consideration. The integration and use of these techniques involved a five-step process of target market identification, product attribute identification, hedonic price estimation, administering of the factorial survey, and determination of consumer willingness-to-pay. The results of these analyses allowed Parker Pen to better focus product development efforts on those design elements for which test market customers indicated both demand and willingness-to-pay. The Parker Pen Company found hedonic pricing and factorial surveys useful for predicting both the rat and the degree of change in consumers' marginal utility for specific product attributes. The usefulness of these techniques also extends beyond the early stages of new product conception. These techniques are helpful in the development and implementation of dynamic new product marketing mix strategies, including such elements as product design, pricing, channel selection, and promotion. © 1995.",Tomkovick C.; Dobie K.E.,Tactical,10.1016/0737-6782(95)00028-R,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of analytical tools like hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys to improve decision-making in product development, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making focused on structured processes and specific targets.",scopus-prediction,20,60,Applying hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys at Parker Pen to enhance new product success,1995
"This paper attempts to shed light on the following research questions: When a firm introduces a new product (or service) how can it effectively use the different information sources available to generate reliable new product performance forecasts? How can the firm account for varying information availability at different stages of the new product launch and generate forecasts at each stage? We address these questions in the context of the sequential launches of motion pictures in international markets. Players in the motion picture industry require forecasts at different stages of the movie launch process to aid decision-making, and the information sets available to generate such forecasts vary at different stages. Despite the importance of such forecasts, the industry struggles to understand and predict sales of new movies in domestic and overseas markets. We develop a Bayesian modeling framework that predicts first-week viewership for new movies in both domestic and several international markets. We focus on the first week because industry players involved in international markets (studios, distributors, and exhibitors) are most interested in these predictions. We draw on existing literature on forecasting performance of new movies to formulate our model. Specifically, we model the number of viewers of a movie in a given week using a Poisson count data model. The number of screens, distribution strategy, movie attributes such as genre, and presence/absence of stars are among the factors modeled to influence viewership. We employ a hierarchical Bayes formulation of the Poisson model that allows the determinants of viewership to vary across countries. We adopt the Bayesian approach for two reasons: First, it provides a convenient framework to model varying assumptions of information availability; specifically, it allows us to make forecasts by combining different sources of information such as domestic and international market-specific data. Second, this methodology provides us with the entire distribution of the new movie's performance forecast. Such a predictive distribution is more informative than a point estimate and provides a measure of the uncertainty in the forecasts. We propose a Bayesian prediction procedure that provides viewership forecasts at different stages of the new movie release process. The methodology provides forecasts under a number of information availability scenarios. Thus, forecasts can be obtained with just information from a historical database containing data on previous new product launches in several international markets. As more information becomes available, the forecasting methodology allows us to combine historical information with data on the performance of the new product in the domestic market and thereby to make forecasts with less uncertainty and greater accuracy. Our results indicate that for all the countries in the data set the number of screens on which a movie is released is the most important influence on viewership. Furthermore, we find that local distribution improves movie sales internationally in contrast to the domestic market. We also find evidence of similar genre preferences in geographically disparate countries. We find that the proposed model provides accurate forecasts at the movie-country level. Further, the model outperforms all the extant models in the marketing literature that could potentially be used for making these forecasts. A comparison of root mean square and mean absolute errors for movies in a hold out sample shows that the model that combines information available from the different sources generates the lowest errors. A Bayesian predictive model selection criterion corroborates the superior performance of this model. We demonstrate that the Bayesian model can be combined with industry rules of thumb to generate cumulative box office forecasts. In summary, this research demonstrates a Bayesian modeling framework that allows the use of different information sources to make new product forecasts in domestic and international markets. Our results underscore the theme that each movie is unique as is each country-and viewership results from an interaction of the product and the market. Hence, the motion picture industry should use both product-specific and market-specific information to make new movie performance forecasts.",Neelamegham R.; Chintagunta P.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.18.2.115,Forecasting; Hierarchical Bayes; International Markets; Motion Pictures; New Products,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The paper discusses methodologies and models for generating performance forecasts for new movie releases, which align with tactical decision-making processes that translate strategic goals into specific targets and actions.",scopus-prediction,20,60,A Bayesian model to forecast new product performance in domestic and international markets,1999
"Marketing managers typically have to use and integrate many pieces of data and marketing intelligence when taking decisions such as whether to launch a product and, if so, at what price. Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers’ responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity – a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making.

"Logit models attempt to answer the following question. Given a set of alternatives, each with multiple attributes, what is the probability that a decision maker will choose a certain alternative? Initially psychologists, then economists and marketing strategists, more recently transportation policy makers and design engineers have employed logit models. A brief review of these models is given in an attempt to show their relevance to more general decision-making situations, and their descriptiveness of human decision-making processes. A new model which synthesizes the desirable features of earlier models is then presented. The new model is applied to an actual case of predicting customer purchase probabilities for a particular brand of an industrial product. The prediction capability of the model is externally validated statistically, using real data, by comparing model results with the actual market share of the company. © 1985 Operational Research Society Ltd.",Coskunoglu O.; Hansotia B.J.; Shaikh M.A.,Tactical,10.1057/jors.1985.5,Decision making; Marketing; Probabilistic choice; Utility theory,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of logit models for predicting customer purchase probabilities, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing strategies and campaign execution.",scopus-prediction,10,70,A new logit model for decision making and its application,1985
"One potentially useful multivariate procedure somewhat overlooked in admissions marketing efforts is a linear compensatory model presented by Cook and Zallocco (1983). This model defines an individual's attitude about a particular college or university as the importance the individual attaches to a specific attribute of the school, and the belief that the institution under consideration possesses that attribute. In this study we extend the model by investigating the importance of applicants' attitudes about competitor institutions, and by controlling for demographic and ability factors that may affect attitudes. Our research demonstrates that attitudes have a significant, positive relationship to enrollment decisions. As well, we incorporate an attitude difference measure that contrasts applicants' attitudes about one institution compared to admissions competitors.

Specifically, we manipulate the number of consumer recommendations and measure motivation to process information in a realistic online shopping environment. Consistent with predictions of dual information processing theories, we find that the amount of eWOM has a significant impact on buyer confidence in product choice. In addition, we find that for buyers less motivated to process information, the effect of eWOM on their choice confidence is mediated by their attitude towards the recommended product, suggesting that the amount of eWOM functions as a purchase cue.

"The dominant approach in brand-extension research has focused on the role of fit in the extension evaluation process. Overemphasis on fit has resulted in research designs that involve singular evaluation of the extension without considering how competing brands in the target category might affect the evaluation of brand extensions. Singular evaluations are known to result in brand positivity effects; that is, brand extensions are evaluated more favorably than is warranted. This research finds that singular evaluations do indeed lead to brand positivity effects. However, brand positivity effects are mitigated when respondents were provided with competitive information along with target-category structure and comparative/non-comparative brand positioning statements. Results also suggest that parent brand-extension fit, though an important determinant of an extension's assessment, plays a less critical role in a comparative evaluation context when an extension's brand strength is accounted for in relation to its competition in the target category. Therefore, the findings stress the importance of both competition and parent-brand fit in making informed positioning decisions and more realistic predictions of extension success.

"Electroencephalography (EEG) offers insights into the neural responses of consumers to marketing stimuli which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such stimuli in directing favorable consumer behavior in real-world settings. This practical review provides guidelines for using EEG in consumer and marketing research. It provides recommendations for how EEG may effectively be employed in neuromarketing in the future. EEG requires careful experimental design, and as such, we outline current recommendations for the collection, processing, analysis, and interpretation of EEG evoked potentials (i.e., event related potentials; ERP) and spectral content (i.e., EEG frequency). By providing an introductory overview of EEG measures in marketing and consumer research, this practical review extends previous literature that is primarily focused on other neuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging) and other disciplines (e.g., economics and organizational behaviour). Furthermore, by reviewing how EEG has been used throughout psychophysiological and neuromarketing research, we provide recommendations on how EEG can be used to measure marketing-related outcomes.

"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, influencer marketing has snowballed into a big phenomenon when businesses around the world are trying to use influencers to promote their products and services. However, even though influencer marketing is a craze in the market, the engagement rate and conversion rates of micro-influencers with a smaller size of followers are higher than that of celebrities and mega influencers. It is important to understand the reasons why certain influencers are successful and others are not. Past research mainly focuses on micro-influencers as one group but does not differentiate between micro-influencers who are known personally by their followers and those who are not personally known. This is important as consumers are sceptical towards the product promotion not only of mega-influencers because they believe that influencers, in general, are using their base of followers to promote a product or service for money and fame. Therefore, consumers trust the words and opinions of micro-influencers, who provide information based on their own experience and expertise. It is worth investigating the underlying reason for the success of these micro and nano influencers. Is it the personal connection with the follower? Is it the engagement rate and the choice of products and recommendations? These are some of the points that have been investigated in this research. The objective of this research paper was to explore if followers who share a relationship with or know the micro-influencers personally make their purchase decisions based on the recommendations provided by the influencers. The research findings highlighted that when micro-influencers are known to their followers on a personal level, they wield more persuasive power over their followers. © 2023 Oxbridge Publishing House Ltd UK",Gerlich M.,Tactical,10.58262/tmj.v11i1.1010,consumer behaviour; digital marketing; influencer marketing; marketing; micro-influencer; social media marketing,5.0,,15,0,Transnational Press London Ltd,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of micro-influencers in marketing, particularly their personal connections with followers and how this affects purchase decisions.

"Influencer marketing aims to promote brands and influence consumer decisions, and recent technological advances have created options for non-human, virtual influencers. Such developments suggest the need to determine whether the effects of virtual influencers on consumer decisions differ from those of human influencers, depending on the type of product they are promoting. With a 2 (virtual vs. human influencer) × 2 (utilitarian vs. hedonic product) experimental design, using Instagram influencer posts and data from 275 participants, the current research establishes that the type of influencer does not affect intentions to adopt recommendations. But the influence process varies by type of influencer: Virtual influencers’ recommendations appear more useful, especially for utilitarian products, but consumers identify more with human influencers’ posts. Both usefulness and identification increase intention to adopt influencers’ recommendation. Overall, these results suggest that, while virtual influencers should endorse utilitarian products, human influencers should be hired to endorse hedonic products. © 2023 The Author(s)",Belanche D.; Casaló L.V.; Flavián M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114493,Behavioral intention; Human influencer; Identification; Type of product; Usefulness; Virtual influencer,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The research examines the effectiveness of different types of influencers in marketing campaigns, focusing on how they impact consumer decision-making based on product type.

"With the proliferation of mobile communication technology, many firms, including retailers and consumer banks, are making efforts to develop mobile platforms to better engage with their customers and reduce operational costs. However, the cost advantage of these mobile technologies will not yield fruition unless the mobile channel accounts for a significant share of total transactions. In this article, we explore potential options for firms to promote usage of the mobile channel. To achieve this, we propose a hidden Markov model to both model customers’ decisions and assess different managerial strategies through simulations. While we apply our proposed model to data from a leading financial institution, our approach is equally applicable to other retail settings. The results show that customers’ choices of services and channels are sensitive to process time by type of channel. A 10% increase in process time through non-mobile channels leads to a nearly 14% increase in utilization of mobile banking channel. Therefore, retailing firms could potentially influence customers’ choice of different channels by changing channel-specific process times. Motivated by these findings, we present and compare performances across five different policies, in promoting the usage of mobile channel. Drawing on our simulation results, we also make personalized policy recommendations to firms facing different levels of financial constraints. For those with financial constraints, we recommend a policy of increasing process time for a selected subset of service requests through non-mobile channels. Firms not constrained by the resources might be better off improving process time with the mobile channel by targeting customers identified as having a better relationship with the firm. © 2022 New York University",Chen J.; Rao V.R.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretai.2022.07.001,Customer relationship management; Digital marketing; Hidden Markov model; Mobile channel,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses specific managerial strategies and policies that firms can implement to promote the usage of mobile channels, which aligns with tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Evaluating strategies for promoting retail mobile channel using a hidden Markov model,2023
"Purpose: Communities representing groups of agents with similar interests or functions are one of the essential features of complex networks. Finding communities in real-world networks is critical for analyzing complex systems in various areas ranging from collaborative information to political systems. Given the different characteristics of networks and the capability of community detection in handling a plethora of societal problems, community detection methods represent an emerging area of research. Contributing to this field, the authors propose a new community detection algorithm based on the hybridization of node and link granulation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed algorithm utilizes a rough set-theoretic concept called closure on networks. Initial sets are constructed by using neighborhood topology around the nodes as well as links and represented as two different categories of granules. Subsequently, the authors iteratively obtain the constrained closure of these sets. The authors use node mutuality and link mutuality as merging criteria for node and link granules, respectively, during the iterations. Finally, the constrained closure subsets of nodes and links are combined and refined using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and a local density function to obtain communities in a binary network. Findings: Extensive experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks followed by a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research limitations/implications: The study also contributes to the ongoing effort related to the application of soft computing techniques to model complex systems. The extant literature has integrated a rough set-theoretic approach with a fuzzy granular model (Kundu and Pal, 2015) and spectral clustering (Huang and Xiao, 2012) for node-centric community detection in complex networks. In contributing to this stream of work, the proposed algorithm leverages the unexplored synergy between rough set theory, node granulation and link granulation in the context of complex networks. Combined with experiments of network datasets from various domains, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal co-occurring disjoint, overlapping and nested communities without necessarily assigning each node to a community. Practical implications: This study carries important practical implications for complex adaptive systems in business and management sciences, in which entities are increasingly getting organized into communities (Jacucci et al., 2006). The proposed community detection method can be used for network-based fraud detection by enabling experts to understand the formation and development of fraudulent setups with an active exchange of information and resources between the firms (Van Vlasselaer et al., 2017). Products and services are getting connected and mapped in every walk of life due to the emergence of a variety of interconnected devices, social networks and software applications. Social implications: The proposed algorithm could be extended for community detection on customer trajectory patterns and design recommendation systems for online products and services (Ghose et al., 2019; Liu and Wang, 2017). In line with prior research, the proposed algorithm can aid companies in investigating the characteristics of implicit communities of bloggers or social media users for their services and products so as to identify peer influencers and conduct targeted marketing (Chau and Xu, 2012; De Matos et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). The proposed algorithm can be used to understand the behavior of each group and the appropriate communication strategy for that group. For instance, a group using a specific language or following a specific account might benefit more from a particular piece of content than another group. The proposed algorithm can thus help in exploring the factors defining communities and confronting many real-life challenges. Originality/value: This work is based on a theoretical argument that communities in networks are not only based on compatibility among nodes but also on the compatibility among links. Building up on the aforementioned argument, the authors propose a community detection method that considers the relationship among both the entities in a network (nodes and links) as opposed to traditional methods, which are predominantly based on relationships among nodes only. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Gupta S.; Deodhar S.,Tactical,10.1108/ITP-10-2020-0682,Cohesion; Community; Decision support; IT artifact; Network analysis; Social computing,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses a community detection algorithm that has practical implications for marketing, networking, and customer engagement.

"In the current landscape of ever-increasing levels of digitalization, we are facing major challenges pertaining to data volume. Recommender systems have become irreplaceable both for helping users navigate the increasing amounts of data and, conversely, aiding providers in marketing products to interested users. Data-driven models are susceptible to data bias, materializing in the bias influencing the models’ decision-making. For recommender systems, such issues are well exemplified by occupation recommendation, where biases in historical data may lead to recommender systems relating one gender to lower wages or to the propagation of stereotypes. In particular, consumer-side fairness, which focuses on mitigating discrimination experienced by users of recommender systems, has seen a vast number of diverse approaches. The approaches are further diversified through differing ideas on what constitutes fair and, conversely, discriminatory recommendations. This survey serves as a systematic overview and discussion of the current research on consumer-side fairness in recommender systems. To that end, a novel taxonomy based on high-level fairness definitions is proposed and used to categorize the research and the proposed fairness evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight some suggestions for the future direction of the field. © The Author(s) 2024.",Vassøy B.; Langseth H.,Tactical,10.1007/s10462-023-10663-5,Consumer-side fairness; Fairness; Recommender systems; Survey,5.0,,15,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses consumer-side fairness in recommender systems, which involves structured decision-making processes related to marketing and product recommendations.

"Consumers increasingly rely on social media to obtain product information. The vlog, a new kind of social medium, has been adopted by sellers to connect with consumers. Through this platform, sellers can cooperate with vloggers to recommend products or services to consumers. Extending beyond the previous perspective that consumers’ perceptions and behaviors are influenced by vloggers’ attributes, we herein investigate the influence of recommendation content. Drawing on the means-end chain framework, this paper investigates how the attributes of recommendation content affect consumers’ intention to adopt (i.e., follow) the recommendation. Data collected from 513 respondents provides support for the proposed influences. The results indicate that source credibility, content diagnosticity, and content serendipity drive consumers’ recommendation adoption intention. This research contributes to the literature on rec-vlog marketing by clarifying the significant role of recommendation content.

"In highly developed countries, more and more people use culinary services. Cooking at home, for the family, is giving way to culinary services. Consumers either order food home or use the offers of restaurants and bars. Consumers’ choice of culinary form may be influenced by cooking television programs. Many TV stations broadcast cooking programs. This study examined the impact of television culinary programs on consumer behavior in the restaurant services market. The article examines the interplay of emotional responses, personality traits, and culinary preferences to understand how TV cooking programs influence dining decisions. The study was conducted using the CAWI method, which involved 742 respondents. The study, conducted between May 2021 and April 2022, was addressed to people who visited restaurants presented in the Polish culinary TV show titled “Kitchen Revolutions”. The study revealed that almost 3/4 of the respondents chose restaurants based on the program’s recommendations. Although there was a strong emotional connection with this program—nearly half of the respondents expressed delight in the taste of snacks and main courses—this did not always translate into an increased frequency of eating meals away from home. Only every third respondent said that the program influenced their gastronomic behavior. The research hypotheses examined the extent to which culinary TV shows influence the frequency of visits to restaurants, the perceived quality of life, and the influence on consumers with specific personality traits. The results partially supported the hypothesis that cooking programs on television encourage people to eat out more often, but the perceived impact on quality of life and on some personality traits was less clear. The article contributes to the understanding of consumer behavior in the food service market by highlighting the complex dynamics of emotional reactions, personality traits, and the impact of culinary television programs. The findings have practical implications for the restaurant industry, suggesting a focus on emotional impact, food quality and presentation, and targeting marketing strategies towards consumers who are open to new experiences and ready to experiment. © 2023 by the authors.",Gajdzik B.; Jaciow M.; Wolniak R.; Wolny R.,Tactical,10.3390/foods13010115,consumer behaviors; culinary programs; food choices; gastronomic consumer; television cooking,5.0,,15,0,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The study examines how television culinary programs influence consumer behavior in the restaurant services market, indicating a focus on specific marketing tactics and consumer engagement strategies rather than long-term strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Gastronomic Curiosity and Consumer Behavior: The Impact of Television Culinary Programs on Choices of Food Services,2024
"Numerous marketing scholars have been overly loyal to seminal (and out-dated) analytical processes when using surveys. If this continues, these individuals may receive rejection decisions, as the standards of the so-called publishing game have increased. Accordingly, from an Associate Editor perspective, this commentary provides a contemporary guide (with thirteen stages) on how survey data can be effectively analyzed. This covers a series of basic techniques (like treating missing values, presenting profiling information about samples, and undertaking descriptive statistical analyses), alongside describing some scale purification tools and several complex procedures (e.g., running tests for various forms of reliability and validity, addressing common method variance, and testing for endogeneity bias). Then, some conclusions and methodological recommendations are offered to help authors to advance theory and practice with robust survey data. It is anticipated that these discussion points will facilitate debates among readers of the Journal of Strategic Marketing (and beyond) about the analysis of survey data. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The aim of the study was to determine the factors contributing to online or in-store shopping behaviour among academics from a private higher education institution in South Africa. In addition, the study examined types of products or services consumers are likely to purchase in-store and online and particular aspects relating to store atmosphere, as well as the challenges that were experienced using both modes of shopping. The study was conducted at a private higher education institution. A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among all the academics in the organisation. The study show that the majority of respondents belonged to generation X and Y and that they are more inclined to purchase from both in-store and online stores rather than a singular mode of shopping. However, there is an element of fear, anxiety and uncertainty that customers face when purchasing online. This is motivated by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model. Factors that influence the overall purchasing decision for both online and in-store shopping include accessibility, convenience, delivery service, store aesthetics (atmosphere and ambience) and the availability of an assistant. Recommendations for retail marketing managers include the fact that they should consider a hybrid model of both in-store and online shopping. Moreover, invest in enhancing the store image of both physical stores as well as virtual online stores as the subtle atmospheric cues trigger impulse purchasing. © 2023, Econjournals.

"Safety in consumer goods is maintained by product safety laws and associated regulations. However, the legislation and regulations are specific to product categories and legal jurisdictions, thus impeding one's ability to understand what a recall is and isn’t, and how it differs from related phenomena (e.g., product-harm crisis). The authors aim to provide such an understanding. They reviewed 510 reports from academics, managers, governments, and regulators; conducted interviews with 25 practitioners; and used 10 recall data sets to identify seven fundaments of recall. They synthesize the fundaments to propose a definition and a decision tree of recall, which can help inform academics, journalists, managers, lawyers, and safety advocates regarding what term is appropriate in what context. The authors apply the fundaments to identify similarities and differences between a recall and a harm crisis, the term used frequently in marketing research in association with recall. The fundaments also enable the authors to make five recommendations each for lawmakers and regulators in an effort to guide the academic and practitioner discourse on product recall. © American Marketing Association 2024.",Astvansh V.; Antia K.D.; Tellis G.J.,Tactical,10.1177/07439156241242419,conceptual; product recall; product-harm crisis; research agenda; review,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses the identification of product recalls and their distinctions from related concepts, which implies structured decision-making and recommendations for lawmakers and regulators.

"In recent years, social media influencers (SMIs) have become part of the strategic communication of firms because the traditional form of mass media communication is losing its effectiveness. Thus, it is imperative to study the effects of communication through SMIs on marketing outcomes, such as purchase intentions. Based on the fairness dimensions, that is, information, distributive, interpersonal, and procedural, and dimensions of source credibility, that is, attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, and similarity, this research investigated how technology-oriented SMIs (T-SMIs) foster parasocial relationships (PSRs) with followers. Purposive sampling was employed to collect data from 506 active social media users. Data were analysed through IBM AMOS and SPSS 26. The results of the study suggested that attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, similarity, interpersonal, procedural, and information fairness are positively related to fostering PSR with followers. In contrast, distributive fairness does not strengthen PSR with followers; furthermore, the study findings suggested an indirect positive influence of attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, similarity, interpersonal, procedural, and information fairness on the purchase intentions of consumers via PSR. This study is useful for academia and industry since it fills important gaps in the literature and provides recommendations to brand managers of technology companies about selecting appropriate SMIs for the endorsement of their brands. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Ashraf A.; Hameed I.; Saeed S.A.,Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12917,fairness; parasocial relationships; purchase intention; social media influencers; source credibility,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses specific variables influencing marketing outcomes through social media influencers, indicating a focus on structured decision-making related to marketing strategies and user engagement.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,How do social media influencers inspire consumers' purchase decisions?

"Purpose: This paper aims to assess the representation of women of color (WOC) in the top 3 fashion magazines and explore the implications of underrepresentation within marketing communications. The authors draw from diffusion theory and marketplace omission and commission to situate the research focus and highlight its application to the study findings. Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis was conducted on 481 cover models on the top three fashion magazines of 2018 – Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair during 2006–2018. Findings: The findings indicate WOC are underrepresented despite the strides of inclusion in the marketplace in America during a postracial period. Representation is as follows: white – 412 (86%); black – 41 (9%); Latina – 19 (3.9%); biracial 7 (1.5%); Asian – 1 (0.2%); and Native American – 1 (0.2%). Latina models had the lowest representation. Native and Asian women were completely excluded. When they do appear, black and Latina cover models are more likely than white models to be shown wearing sexually suggestive attire. Practical implications: This study makes four recommendations to promote antiracism in marketing: diversify staff hiring and editorial decision-makers for public-facing talent; solicit counsel from multicultural marketing agencies; create antiracist marketing curriculum; and cultivate a pipeline of diverse talent for future hiring.

"Difficult economic times might encourage private label purchases, though most such decisions occur in-store. The current study therefore presents an analysis of whether in-store displays (ISD) exert similar effects on private labels versus national brands, which ISD are most effective, and how retailers can maximize their effects. With a triple coherence line (TCL) framework, the authors determine ISD that favor a decision process in which the consumer can easily recognize the benefits of a promotion, increase their impact on sales, especially if the product itself offers similar benefits. They establish a novel, unique data set of scanner and observational data about daily product prices and sales in 22 categories, according to the uses of different ISD (shelf signage, end-of-aisle, islands) and promotions (price, product). The results confirm their different effects on private labels versus national brands; when ISD facilitate decision processes that are congruent with private-label purchase motivations, they exert greater effects on sales, and these effects can be maximized by applying the TCL framework. In detail, shelf signage that stimulates more cognitive and rational purchase decisions exerts powerful effects on private label purchases, which get reinforced by price promotions. These insights extend previous studies of in-store marketing actions and purchase decisions, leading to some useful recommendations for retailers. © 2023 The Authors",Garrido-Morgado Á.; González-Benito Ó.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103642,In-store display; National brand; Private label; Triple coherence line,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on how in-store displays affect consumer purchasing decisions for private labels versus national brands, providing actionable insights for retailers.

"Aim/Purpose Parasocial relationships are today established on social media between influenc-ers and their followers. While marketing effects are well-researched, little is known about the meaning of such relationships and the psychological mecha-nisms behind them. This study, therefore, explores the questions: “How do fol-lowers on Instagram interpret explicit fiction cues from influencers?” and “What does this reveal about the meaning of parasocial attachment?” Background With a billion-dollar advertising industry and leading in influencing opinion, In-stagram is a significant societal and economic player. One factor for the effec-tive influence of consumers is the relationship between influencer and follower. Research shows that disclosing advertisements surprisingly does not harm credi-bility, and sometimes even leads to greater trustworthiness and, in turn, willing-ness to purchase. While such reverse dynamics are measurable, the mechanisms behind them remain largely unexplored. Methodology The study follows an explorative approach with in-depth interviews, which are analyzed with Mayring’s content analysis under a reconstructive paradigm. The findings are discussed through the lens of critical psychology. Contribution Firstly, this study contributes to the understanding of the communicative dy-namics of influencer-follower communication alongside the reality-fiction-gap model, and, secondly, it contributes empirical insights through the analysis of 22 explorative interviews. Findings The findings show (a) how followers rationalize fiction cues and justify compul-sive decision-making, (b) how followers are vulnerable to influences, and (c) how parasocial attachment formation overshadows rational logic and agency.Rationalizing Fiction Cues 86 The findings are discussed with regard to mechanisms, vulnerabilities, rationali-zations and cognitive bias, and the social self, as well as the ethics of influencer marketing and politics. Recommendations for Practitioners The paper has relevance for professionals working with children, the youth, and adults, in understanding their relationships and their meaning both on the indi-vidual and societal level. Such improve insights and adequate measures in peda-gogy, education, health, and therapy. Furthermore, critical perspectives on par-asociallity and its mechanisms can contribute to ethical policymaking. Recommendations for Researchers The contribution is relevant to relationship research, group dynamics and socie-tal organizing, well-being, identity, and health perspectives, within psychology, sociology, media studies, and pedagogy to management. Impact on Society This paper contributes to comprehending nowadays relationships and processes of identification through a systemic lens and develops a critical reflection on current conditions in life. Future Research Future research might seek to understand more about (a) quantifiable vulnera-bilities, such as attachment styles, dispositions, and demographics, (b) usage pat-terns and possible factors of prevention, (c) cognitive and emotional mecha-nisms involved with larger samples, (d) the impact on relationships and well-be-ing, and (e) possible conditions for the potential of parasocial attachment. © 2023, Informing Science.

"Several factors have contributed to a downward trend in postgraduate education enrollment in Vietnamese higher education. Understanding postgraduate students’ university choice criteria is crucial for developing effective marketing strategies in higher education settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate postgraduate students’ perceptions of their university choices and to evaluate the correlations between their marketing and communication, social support, and economic factors and their university choices. A survey consisting of 401 questionnaires and 05 semi-structured interviews was conducted at some of the most prestigious multidisciplinary universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The findings reveal that postgraduate students generally show a high degree of agreement in their university choice decisions. Additionally, differences in demographic characteristics, such as family income and father's education, were found to influence their preferences. Furthermore, the study suggests that marketing and communication, social support, and economic factors have varying and significant impacts, both positive and negative, on their decisions. The results of this study hold theoretical and practical implications for Vietnamese higher education.

"This study unpacks how a person’s multiple identities affect their decision making when selecting a tourism destination. We propose that different aspects of identity yield distinct yet competing emotions. For instance, perceived social audience admiration combined with animosity might produce ambivalence, leading to greater decision-making uncertainty. Findings show that tourists with greater ambivalence towards particular destination countries are more likely to cancel or postpone their travel decisions. Additionally, the destination country’s economic development and a tourist’s pursuit of material happiness interact as moderators in the relationships between identities, emotions, and travel intention.

"It is already a fact that young people are addicted to social networks, particularly, generation Z. This social-savvy netizen uses social networks extensively to engage with socially connected people, but also actively interacts with online retailers and brands through social networks. This suggests that generation Z consumers seamlessly involve their connected social community to obtain reviews and recommendations, and then use this information to guide their purchasing decisions. This study argued that desire is the leading predictor influence online social shopping purchase intention. We applied the Model of Goal-directed behaviour to examine the influence of social desire and commercial desire on online social shopping purchase intention. At the same time, it attempts to examine whether social desire and commercial desire play a mediator role. This study, which is confined to Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, focuses on generation Z consumers aged 17 to 26 years old. A total of 288 samples were collected using the purposive sampling technique and analysed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings revealed that social attitude influences social desire and commercial attitude influenced commercial desire. Lastly, online social shopping purchase intention was influenced by both social desire and commercial desire. It indicates that both social desire and commercial desire play a mediating role.

"Purpose: The growth in social content such as video facilitates consumer exposure to social information at e-tail settings. Research has recommended enhancing the e-store socialness. Focusing on focal consumer outcomes (flow and purchase intentions), the current research delineates a boundary condition, proposing that e-tail socialness improves outcomes when the consumer interdependent self, rather than the independent self, is activated. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental approach is employed to test the research thesis. Two experiments (N1 = 303 Females 42.4%; N2 = 387 Females 51.4%) that used different manipulation for socialness and sample frames (USA and Canadian) are performed. Analysis of variance was applied. Findings: The results generally support the research thesis, suggesting that e-tail socialness enhances consumer flow and purchase intentions when the interdependent self is activated. The effect, however, is marginal for segments with high brand preference. Practical implications: As more information increase overload and reduce decision quality, e-tail practitioners should focus on providing social information predominately for consumers whose interdependent self is activated. This recommendation is particularly relevant for segments with low brand preference. Originality/value: So far, studies recommend enhancing the e-store socialness, or increasing the social volume, to achieve better outcomes. Such research stream is giving rise to the “social is better in e-tail” conventional wisdom. The current work contributes by delineating a boundary condition based on consumer self-construal. This work suggests that the use of online socialness is fruitful predominantly for interdependent consumers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Aljukhadar M.; Senecal S.,Tactical,10.1108/BJM-10-2022-0397,Digital marketing; E-store socialness; Etsy; Flow; Purchase intentions; Social cues,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract focuses on enhancing e-tail socialness to improve consumer outcomes like flow and purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific marketing targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Consumer self-construal modulates the relevance of E-tail socialness,2023
"The considerable marketing potential brought by the rapid growth of social media has been extensively examined in the literature, particularly in terms of the impact of influencers' recommendations on their followers' decisions. However, little attention has been given to how the individual influencers' use of multiple social networking sites affects their followers' behavioral intentions. Hence, this academic gap warrants further exploration. Drawing on cue consistency theory, social identity theory, and stimulus-organism-response framework, this research proposes three research questions and constructs an integrated research model to explore how the influencers' cue consistency affects the social identification of their followers, subsequently influencing their behavioral intentions. A structural equation modeling technique is performed to analyze the data of 510 valid respondents. The findings show that influencers' consistent cues (i.e., information and image consistency) across social media have positive impacts on followers' cognitive and affective identification toward the influencers. Furthermore, the determinants for followers' purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth intention are affirmed to serve as both cognitive and affective identification. Especially, the results indicate that the relationships between followers’ social identifications and behavioral intentions are moderated by the type of influencer (i.e., lifestyle vs. review). Accordingly, the results indicate how the use of multiple social networking sites by influencers impacts the behavioral intentions of their followers. The findings offer new insights into influencer marketing and provide important lessons for marketers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Hsieh J.-K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103397,Cue consistency theory; Influencer marketing; Multi-SNS usage; Social identity theory; Social networking site (SNS); Stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research explores the impact of influencers' consistent cues on followers' behavioral intentions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions.

"Whereas much research has looked at how recommendation systems influence online purchase intentions, this article illustrates the dual process model by which they occur. Using two studies, we fill the research void in interactive marketing by demonstrating how the dual processes of social proof and risk avoidance mediate the impact of recommendation labels on consumer decision-making contingent upon their level of involvement. Study 1 (n = 73), used a mixed-subjects design with a college student sample to demonstrate that both types of recommendation labels will lead to higher purchase intentions in an online setting. Most importantly, it provides evidence for the main effect of our theoretical model across different product categories. Study 2 (n = 160) provides support for our remaining four hypotheses by demonstrating the underlying process through which recommendation labels have a two-fold effect on purchase intentions. Specifically, the recommendation label increased the risk avoidance effect for high-involvement consumers and enhanced the social proof effect for low-involvement consumers. In both cases, the recommendation labels increased purchase intentions. Implications of our findings for theoretical and practical contributions and future directions are also explored. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Xu L.; Roy A.; Niculescu M.,Tactical,10.1080/15332861.2022.2049113,Low and high involvement; online purchase intention; recommendation label; risk avoidance; social proof,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses how recommendation systems affect consumer decision-making through specific mediators such as social proof and risk avoidance.

"Purpose: There is much evidence in the literature showing the benefits of input market participation on farmers’ welfare. The same is true for participation in marketing. However, there are very few studies on the expected benefit of input market participation and marketing. This study fills this gap by examining the issue in the Senegalese context for food and cash crops. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression using a highly detailed 2017 agricultural survey in Senegal. They first identify factors that shape farmers’ decision to participate in the input market and marketing and then assess the impact of market participation choices on farmers’ profits. Findings: The results show that the most profitable market participation regime depends on the crop under consideration. For food crops, joint participation in markets maximizes profit per hectare, while for groundnuts, the main cash crop in Senegal, participation in the input market is not necessary to maximize farm profit. Research limitations/implications: Using panel data would improve the quality of estimations (time-variant effects) and help to consider the role of risk in output and input markets. Originality/value: This paper helps to characterize different profiles of farmers based on their market participation and crop choices and provide policymakers with recommendations for maximizing farmers’ profit. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Camara A.; Goundan A.; Henning C.; Savard L.; Beye A.,Tactical,10.1108/JADEE-08-2021-0201,Agricultural market participation; Farm household model; Multinomial endogenous switching regression,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study offers insights into market participation strategies for farmers, which aligns with tactical decisions that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets focused on maximizing profits.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Joint market participation choices of smallholder farmers and households’ welfare: evidence from Senegal,2023
"University students in China are increasingly embracing the use of celebrity endorsement in teaching. Celebrities are now able to rapidly and easily reach a huge audience because of the growth of social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin, which makes them an appealing marketing tool for educational institutions. The potential advantages of leveraging celebrity endorsements to advertise their programs and draw students have been acknowledged by educational institutions in China. In addition to examining educational celebrity endorsement and educational purchase intention attainment, the study examines students' desire to act as moderators and planned behavior theory in Chinese universities. 440 students from various Chinese universities participated in an online and in-person survey that collected the data for the analysis. According to the findings of structural equation modeling (SEM), teaching strategies have a positive impact on students' desires. The study's results also showed a connection between achieving educational purchase intentions and celebrity endorsement of educational products, student consumer choice, and student desire. Cross-sectional analysis, close-ended questions, and quantitative research are all used in the current study. In light of this, it is deemed crucial to use creative and engaging teaching strategies in the higher education sector. Educational institutions can create marketing plans that boost students' purchasing intentions and enrollment levels by focusing on attitudes, arbitrary standards, and perceived behavioral control. To demonstrate the relationships between the constructs under consideration, future research on this topic should involve longitudinal or field testing.

"The present study attempted to determine the elements affecting users' opinions about using electronic auctions in Jordan. The study's target audience was Jordanian university students. We ran-domly selected 600 students from three public universities in Jordan after 600 users from each of the three universities responded to the surveys. The primary data for this study were gathered using a specially created questionnaire that was based on earlier research. SEM software (smart PLS 4.0.8.3) was employed in the evaluation of data. This study looked into the factors that led Jordanians to use electronic auctions and found four indirect significant relationships and ten direct significant relationships. First, user attitudes and independent variables (usefulness, aware-ness, ease of use, and techno trust) are directly significant antecedents of utilizing e-auctions in Jordan. The use of e-auctions is related to the independent variable in five direct and significant ways: usefulness, awareness, ease of use, digital divide, and techno trust. Thirdly, there are direct and statistically significant correlations between user attitudes and the independent variables (use-fulness, awareness, ease of use, and techno trust). Fourthly, there appears to be a clear and significant link between user attitudes and the intention to use e-auctions. Fifth, there are four mediated meaningful indirect correlations between the intention to use e-auctions and the independent var-iable. The findings of the current study are based on a number of factors that affect the demand for e-commerce in Jordan. They also include some recommendations for academics and decision-makers in e-marketing affairs.

"Purpose: The study investigates the mediated moderation impact of Memorable Religious Experience (MRE) and Religiosity (REL) on the relationship between Memorable Tourism Experience (MTE) and Attitude towards Pilgrimage (ATT) finally driving Recommend Intention (RCI) of visitors to a religious site. It suggests visitors' incentive variable religiosity can influence their decision to recommend visiting a religious destination. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a quantitative cross-sectional approach wherein a self-administered survey was used for data collection from 223 pilgrims who visited a popular pilgrimage site. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed for analysis. Findings: The results showed that MTE has a significant influence on ATT which further influences RCI (a dimension of behavioral intention-BI) of visitors towards a religious destination. Further, MRE mediates the relationship between MTE and ATT. Nevertheless, REL illustrated a significant moderation influence on the relationship between MRE and ATT, further verifying the mediated moderation impact of MRE and REL in the model. Practical implications: Recommendation of existing customers is one of the most powerful indicators of customer loyalty and usually leads to revisit. The research provides destination managers/tourism planners of pilgrimage sites to formulate appropriate marketing strategies to develop RCI and sustainable branding. Originality/value: This study adds to the empirical studies conducted on REL by constructing a composite picture of the memorable tourism experience within a pilgrimage tourism context. The uniqueness lies in the attempt to investigate the mediated moderation impact of MRE and REL using a symmetric (PLS-SEM) approach. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bhandari H.; Mittal A.; Arora M.,Tactical,10.1108/JHTI-11-2023-0848,Memorable religious experience; Memorable tourism experience; Pilgrimage; PLS-SEM; Recommend intention; Religiosity,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on understanding the relationship between memorable tourism experiences, attitudes towards pilgrimage, and recommendation intentions, which involves structured decision-making for marketing strategies.

"Social media influencers have become important motivators in shaping tourist attitudes and behaviors. This study analyzed how exposure to influencer content impacts key outcomes for the destination Jordan. A survey of tourists who visited Jordan in the past 3 years measured their perceptions of influencer credibility, content quality, awareness/interest, trust/engagement, destination image, general tourism behavior, and intentions to revisit. Results of SEM analysis found significant positive effects of influencer marketing on both destination image and visit intentions. Awareness/interest and trust/engagement were most impactful, highlighting influencers' role in sparking early motivation. Content quality additionally predicted visit intentions by informing decisions. Perceived credibility made recommendations more persuasive. Furthermore, usage intensity positively moderated the mediated relationships, amplifying effects among heavy social media users. Findings provide theoretical validation of how influencers act as digital opinion leaders. By enhancing destination image through compelling portrayals, influencers shape audience travel interests and behaviors. Managerial implications suggest destinations should invest in influencer campaigns for reach and inspiration while ensuring content quality. Performance tracking informs optimal platform and demographic targeting. Overall, influencer marketing demonstrated significant persuasive appeal for potential tourists. This quantitative study pioneer’s measurement of influencer marketing's tangible impacts on key tourist metrics. The results empirically substantiate the ability of strategically leverage influencers to motivate visitation and guide decisionmaking.

"Purpose: The Bed and Breakfast (B&B) enterprises generally lack sufficient human resources and time to conduct research on important social media marketing factors for visitors’ satisfaction and visitors’ intentions. Therefore, this study aims to provide crucial social media marketing and factors and service quality elements for improving customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in B&B sectors. This study also provides some recommendations for attracting more visitors and increasing customer satisfaction and customer loyalty through social media. Design/methodology/approach: First, social media marketing factors and service quality elements were identified through the systematic literature review. Then these identified factors and elements were used to design a survey questionnaire for collecting data. The research data included responses of 64 B&B enterprises and 625 customers. The collected data was analyzed by feature selection approaches including Decision Tree algorithm and Information Gain to identify the key factors for improving customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Findings: The findings of this study determined that featured choice is an important social media marketing factor, and assurance is the common service quality element for both B&B enterprises and their customers in terms of satisfaction and loyalty. Originality/value: This study adds a value to the growing literature on customer satisfaction and loyalty in B&B sectors by exploring key social media marketing factors and service quality elements. The study reveals several implications for theories and practices. The findings hopefully help B&B enterprises better social media marketing with less workforce and budget. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Nalluri V.; Yang K.-F.; Chen L.-S.; Yang T.-Y.K.,Tactical,10.1108/IJTC-10-2022-0230,B&B enterprises and customers perspectives; Bed and breakfast sectors; Feature selection; Service quality elements; Social media marketing,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on identifying specific social media marketing factors and service quality elements that can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty in B&B enterprises, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving strategic goals through concrete actions.",scopus-recommendation,15,70,Exploring crucial social media marketing factors for improving customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in bed and breakfast sectors in Taiwan,2023
"In the post-pandemic landscape, scant research has been conducted on the timely, in-depth examination of how food-related attributes affect tourist food choices. To tackle this issue, this study employed a discrete choice experiment and latent class nested logit models for a nuanced exploration of tourist food preferences. This approach captured both tourists’ preference heterogeneity and substitution effects among fast, local, and hometown-style food options. Findings reveal that price, food taste rating, waiting time, service, and environment are key determinants of tourists’ food choices. Our model identified two distinct tourist classes, Local-food-image class and Anti-price-quality class, each displaying unique food preferences and substitution patterns. This research contributes to tourism and hospitality literature by offering an updated and nuanced understanding of post-pandemic tourists’ food preferences and decision-making trade-offs. It offers practical recommendations for targeted marketing and effective resource allocation, ultimately strengthening resilience and fostering sustainable development within hospitality, catering, and tourism sectors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Zhou H.; Song C.; Chi X.; Li W.; Han H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijhm.2023.103652,Discrete choice experiment; Food preference; Hospitality manager; Latent class nested logit; Local food; Willingness-to-pay,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study provides insights into specific food-related attributes that influence tourist choices, which can be utilized for targeted marketing strategies and operational decisions.

"Today, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is considered one of tourism businesses’ most effective forms of communication. Using eWOM on social media as an alternative decision aid can benefit consumers. This study examines the information adoption model to determine how consumers adopt eWOM on Instagram, and the subsequent influence on their travel behaviour. This study identifies the need for information as a predictor of information usefulness, converted to adoption and visit intentions. To test the research hypotheses, 263 respondents who had visited destinations based on eWOM recommendations on Instagram participated in the experiment. The data were analysed using a structural equation modelling approach using Smart-PLS 3.0. The findings indicate that the need for information is the most significant factor affecting the usefulness of the information. Furthermore, source credibility and argument quality are critical factors in enhancing the information’s usefulness. Thus, this study has significantly contributed to the theory by adding the need of information to predict visit intentions in the IAM model. Consumers are more likely to adopt high-quality information and convert it into a visit intention. This study provides practical guidelines for tourism managers who wish to utilise social media platforms (e.g., Instagram) as marketing communication tools to encourage eWOM about their destinations. © 2023 The Author(s).

"– General societal developments show that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about lasting changes in attitudes towards education and lifestyle, among others. The presented study aims to verify, using a quantitative questionnaire survey method on a sample of 500 respondents each, whether there have been changes in the preferences of potential students at a selected university in the Czech Republic between pre-Covid (2017) and post-Covid (2022) years. Current studies show that the post-COVID decision-making process is, among other things, generally more affected by the relationships with family and friends. Also, the paper’s goal is to verify whether this fact also applies to the area of preferences of university applicants and whether it is differentiated by gender. Based on the statistical testing and interpretation of the data, recommendations will be formulated for the marketing management of universities concerning how to adapt to changes in the preferences of applicants and how to effectively adjust the communication mix and message to the given target group, thereby increasing its interest in studying at the university. The proposed measures will thus contribute to increasing the competitiveness of universities, as they identify opportunities to target potential students more effectively. © 2024 Martina Juříková, Josef Kocourek & Eliška Káčerková; published by UIKTEN.

"This study aimed to examine the impact of augmented reality (AR) on the purchasing behavior of Saudi customers using analytic–descriptive methods and data from a snowball sample of 812 online buyers. Positive correlations were found between AR factors (hermeneutic, embodiment, and background) and dimensions (quality, fun, and creativity) and the purchase experience. Young women aged 17–26 mainly use AR for buying clothes and accessories, and the majority of the sample shops are available locally through mobile apps. The findings indicate that AR has a significant influence on buying decisions and suggest its potential use in marketing communications. The results also reveal that gender, social status, education level, and monthly income have an impact on participants’ responses to AR, with women and those who are married having more favorable views. Clothing and accessories were found to be the most frequently purchased products through AR. There were no significant differences based on age or the number of family members. Participants reported positively about their AR experience, and their concerns and anxiety did not affect their purchasing experience. Based on the main study’s results, a number of recommendations can be made: Saudi businesses need to use AR in their marketing communication strategies to meet consumer needs and trends. To maximize the benefits of brand awareness, they should use AR techniques and adopt this technology for products that depend on design in their production. When using AR in general and in light of the theories that have been studied, it is important to think about the cultural traits and dimensions of Saudi consumers and conduct further exploratory research before implementation. © 2023 by the author.",AL Hilal N.S.H.,Tactical,10.3390/su15065448,advertising; augmented reality (AR); marketing communications; online buying; purchasing decisions,5.0,,15,0,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The study examines specific factors influencing the purchasing behavior of Saudi customers through augmented reality (AR), which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to offer a conceptual model that bridges gaps in the current research by combining constructs from the health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Furthermore, the researchers applied the constructed model to analyse the determinants of workers’ intentions to use e-wallet payment options for business transactions rather than physical currency during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the paper examines whether there are any significant variations in the usage intentions of Ghanaian workers in the formal and informal sectors. Design/methodology/approach: The non-probability convenience sampling technique was used to compile the primary respondents among Ghanaian users of e-wallets. Based on constructs derived from the HBM and TPB, an online survey involving the use of a questionnaire was administered to collect quantitative data from 285 formal and informal sector workers in Ghana. Data collected was analysed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling approach involving the measurement, structural model tests, hypothesis tests and multi-group analysis (MGA) tests. Findings: This study reveals that workers’ attitudes, subjective norms and perceived susceptibility as the main determinants of intentions to use e-wallets, as the analysis of data lends support to hypotheses involving these constructs. Perceived behavioural control was however not supported by the data analysis as a determinant of workers’ intention. Finally, there were no significant differences between e-wallet usage intentions of formal and informal sector workers in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: Given the ongoing pandemic, the study recommends that governments of emerging economies should formulate policies that promote the use of e-wallets, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and at the same time contribute to the quest for a cashless economy. However, the results of the study are only based on data collected from workers in Ghana. Therefore, practitioners should apply the recommendations with discretion and make modifications where necessary. The results of the study also provide evidence from the context of a developing country that can support future academic pursuits. Practical implications: This study provides evidence that influences practitioners’ decisions and practices regarding the design and implementation of e-wallet services and innovations among workers in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. Originality/value: This study provides useful business insights to user acquisition managers, marketing managers and business development managers during the formulation of policies, strategies and approaches for their mobile wallet subscriber base. Moreover, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first to apply the constructs of the HBM (mainly applied in health research) to the study of workers’ intentions to use e-wallets. It, therefore, makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by examining the combined effects of the constructs of the HBM and the TPB on workers’ intention to use e-wallets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Amankwa E.; Amissah G.; Okoampa-Larbi R.,Tactical,10.1108/JSTPM-09-2021-0137,Attitude; Cashless economy; COVID-19; E-wallet; Intentions; Mobile money; Perceived severity; Perceived susceptibility; Subjective norm; Theory of planned behaviour,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a conceptual model to analyze the determinants of workers' intentions to use e-wallets, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on specific targets and structured approaches to user engagement and technology adoption.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Cashless economy – the nexus of COVID-19 and E-wallet usage intentions: a multi-group analysis between formal and informal sector workers in Ghana,2023
"The study aims to discover the effect of marketing deception practised by mobile phone companies in after-sales services, whether they are providing guarantee services, after-sales service price, promotion or distribution regarding the decision for consumer purchase. A descriptive analytical method has been selected. Data was collected through a questionnaire that was distributed electronically to random individual samples, represented by graduate students in both the Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology for Post-graduate studies and the Higher Institute for Financial and Accounting Studies / University of Baghdad. The sample size consisted of (60) students while the data analysis showed that there is a correlation between marketing deception of after-sales service and consumer purchasing decision. Marketing deception related to price significantly affects consumer purchase decisions, however marketing deception in service, promotion and distribution does not significantly affect consumer sparks decision. This result is due to the nature of consumer culture, the studied sample and the extent of their understanding of the questions. Amongst the most important recommendations of the study is the necessity of working to activate the role of the Consumer Protection Association to monitor the market in the after-sales services sector by conducting awareness campaigns for consumers of their rights to enhance their ability to test the quality of services provided to them and impose penalties on marketing companies that demonstrate the practice of marketing deception in order to reduce unethical practices.  © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Al-Heali A.N.,Tactical,,Analytical study; Consumer purchasing decision; Marketing deception,5.0,,15,0,Primrose Hall Publishing Group,"The study provides insights into consumer behavior regarding after-sales services and marketing deception, which relates to structured decision-making in marketing practices.

"The synergy between accounting and marketing is often overlooked despite the implications in strategic decision-making (Roslender & Hart 2006) and cross-functional operations (Cravens & Guilding 1999). Marketing students are rarely exposed to the accounting information they need to be effective decision-makers. Accounting information is typically not included in comprehensive marketing case studies. Yet, management accountants provide financial information and analysis such as product line and individual product profitability, product and customer costs and brand valuations to marketing professionals that is crucial effective decision-making. This case exposes accounting and/or marketing students to the interdependencies of accounting and marketing and provides an opportunity to analyze and evaluate internal financial reports for Ryder Rides® (R2), a company that assembles and sells professional and recreational bicycles.

"The research study explored the role of Public Relations (PR) elements such as seminars and speeches, digital media in creating a positive corporate image and corporate identity and explored how selected private colleges in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe can leverage on publicity to boost students’ enrolment. Extant literature of PR was approached and the Hedging and Wedging theory of communication was used as the theoretical framework for the research. The researcher applied mixed-pluralist research approach, where the qualitative research design was nested into partially quantitative research design. Methodology applied was exploratory, deductively anchored on the critical analysis of the data and discussion of findings to arrive at an informed decision.

This research focus is contextualised with analysis on the CDM process and the disparity between UK and international students, to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the influential factors. The findings of this research point to accreditation, price and rankings having the most influence on CDM among prospective online MBA students. It suggests that the CDM process among international students is more extensive than among UK students. International students’ searches had a longer duration, compared more programme alternatives, favoured detailed information such as course content and marketing materials, and searches often culminated in an application to more than one university. Meanwhile, UK students were more influenced by outbound university phone communications, which the data imply is attributable to English being their first language.

"Successful marketing efforts and professional sales encounters often depend on consumer involvement in the purchase decision process itself, which in turn may impact firm performance. Despite the importance of consumer involvement, research has yet to fully explain the relationship between consumer personality characteristics and the nature of consumer purchase involvement. This study explores the degree to which consumer perception of salesperson ethical treatment helps explain the relationship between consumer personality characteristics and nature of involvement. Data were collected from a large sample of working adults placed in two scenario-based positive professional sales encounters featuring an important purchase decision. The results indicated that adult consumers’ personality characteristics functioned through judgment of salesperson ethical treatment to affect the nature of purchase involvement. Specifically, consumer judgment of salesperson ethical treatment fully mediated a positive relationship between internal locus of control and cognitive (as opposed to affective) involvement. By comparison, consumer judgment of a salesperson ethical treatment partially mediated the positive relationship between emotional awareness and cognitive (as opposed to affective) involvement. The above findings were similar for informational and relational salesperson customer-orientated scenarios. Key implications for selling professionals and sales organizations are discussed, such as augmenting consumers’ self-assessments to increase their perceptions of salesperson ethics and purchase involvement.

"Aim/Purpose This article takes ‘tourism decision-making behavior’ as an entry point, and deeply analyzes the factors influencing the travel decision-making of Chinese ‘American Travel’ tourists and their degree of influence, so as to provide a reference for the development of Chinese outbound tourism. Background With the development of China’s economy and the improvement in people’s level, the outbound tourism market of Chinese residents has developed rapidly. The United States has become an important tourism destination country for Chinese residents’ outbound tourism, and China has also become one of the important tourist source countries of American tourism. However, the rapid development of ‘American tourism’ has also caused competition problems in China’s tourism industry. For example, prices and tourism products have become a means of competition among tourism enterprises. As the main body of consumption, tourists’ decision-making behavior will be affected by various factors. Methodology Drawing lessons from previous scholars’ research results on tourism decision-making behavior, the influencing factors of tourism decision-making behavior are summarized. A theoretical model and index system of factors influencing tourism decision-making behavior of Chinese residents ‘Travel in the United States’ are established, research hypotheses are put forward, questionnaire data are collected, and SPSS and Amos are used to analyze and verify the theoretical model. Contribution This research expands the literature on topics related to tourism decision-making in research and practice. It establishes a theoretical model and index system for the factors that influence the decision-making behavior of Chinese residents’ ‘American Travel’ tourism. In addition, we propose countermeasures for tourism products, enterprises, and the government. Findings Prior knowledge and external information have a positive influence on tourism perception and value perception, and a negative influence on risk perception. Risk perception value perception has a positive and negative influence on tourism decision-making and tourism motivation, respectively. Tourism motivation has a positive influence on tourism decision-making and has a positive impact. Recommendations According to the research conclusions of this article, the following counter-for Practitioners measures and suggestions are put forward from three aspects of tourism: products, enterprises, and governments. On the basis of existing tourism products, relevant operating companies should pay more attention to the upgrading and transformation of tourism, leisure and entertainment products in scenic spots to increase the willingness of tourists to travel. When considering corporate marketing and promotion plans, tourism companies operating related businesses should increase the weight of their marketing budgets in online marketing, increase investment in online marketing, and develop mobile applications that meet the preferences of Chinese residents in the United States. Do a good job in the timely publication of safety reminders and local information. Safety is an important foundation for tourism development and the core concern of many tourists. Future Research Due to the important research on the impact of tourism activities, the influencing factors are many and complex, and the psychological process of tourism decision-making is carried out directly. There are still unconsidered factors that need to be studied in depth. In the future, it is possible to compare multiple resource-featured themes, and increase the characteristics of potential tourists, and the factors affecting the selection behavior of regional cultural tourists, and so forth, in order to make the research more applicable and practical instructive significance. © 2021.

"Background: Entanglement of marine species, particularly endangered sea turtles and cetaceans, in abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear is a major conservation concern. Focus of the Article: This case study applies Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to reduce marine wildlife net entanglement in the waters surrounding Masirah Island, a marine biodiversity hotspot in Oman. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The study demonstrates the use of social marketing tools in biodiversity conservation, bringing new knowledge to the cross-application of these two fields. Methods: The CBSM methodology was applied to select behaviours, identify barriers and benefits, develop strategies and design a pilot study. The responsible disposal of derelict nets in skip bins was selected as the target behaviour, and a mix of behavioural change tools was applied to achieve change: convenience (installation of three skip bins), education (installation of informative signs, distribution of awareness posters, one-to-one engagement with fishers on the beaches), prompts (installation of signs and posters on vessels) and social norms (one-to-one engagement with key influencers and decision makers). The monitoring of behaviour change took place through structured observations over 23 weeks, focussing on the number of nets disposed of in the allocated skip bins. Results: Results showed a low level of behaviour adoption rate by skiff and launch vessel fisheries, respectively, 5.36% and 2.58%. Positive results were observed for a short time but did not reach the estimated target value throughout the study period. Recommendations for Research: Our pilot study did not lead to broad-scale implementation and we recommend further awareness and engagement with the target audience, trials of various behaviour change tools and increase field monitoring time. We further recommend the application and funding of behaviour change methods applied to fishers with the incorporation of conventional financial, conservation and regulatory tools to support resource management.

"This study explores the usage of mobile marketing tools in the market of restaurant food delivery services. While new mobile tools become available, the enterprises need to rationally select and use those tools. In the study, the market of restaurant food delivery in Ukraine has been analyzed, and the enterprises operating in the market have been classified based on their business processes. It was discovered that the usage of mobile marketing differs for aggregators and food producers, depending on their business processes and marketing goals. For each group of enterprises operating in the market, classification of mobile marketing tools has been done, and approaches for selecting mobile marketing tools by the stages of a purchase decision process have been proposed, based on marketing objectives at every stage of the purchase process. Online customer survey has been conducted, and the Kano model has been applied to estimate customers' satisfaction and their attitude toward mobile marketing tools. Based on the research results, the practical recommendations for selecting the most suitable mobile marketing tools have been developed, and these recommendations take into account the interests of both sides: customers and companies implementing marketing tools. It was found out that the main selection criteria include enterprise internal business processes, marketing objectives, and customer attitudes. The recommendations developed in this study, provide businesses with the approaches necessary to rationally allocate their marketing resources. © 2021.

"Dupe—slang for duplicate—influencers are individuals who persuade buyers to purchase counterfeits using social media platforms to drive a brand message intended to confer legitimacy on the purchase decision. Dupe influencers sell fake luxury goods online to their cadres of followers, who relate to the influencers’ fashion savviness and who trust their judgment of products’ quality. In this article, I provide a synopsis of a case Amazon settled against two dupe influencers who used social media to promote the sale of counterfeit luxury products. I highlight the persistent challenge of luxury counterfeits sold online, the consumer complicity of obtaining luxury fakes, and the problem of discerning a knockoff from a counterfeit product. Dupe influencers leverage trust with their followers and use social media tactics, such as unboxing videos and designer haul promotions, to peddle luxury fakes. Recommendations to combat dupe influencers center on monitoring and working with e-commerce platforms to shut down social media posts that infringe a company's intellectual property, raising consumer awareness of the illicit activities of counterfeiters through education campaigns, leveraging legitimate social influencers to debunk the dupe influencers, and pursuing legal remedies. © 2022 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Chaudhry P.E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.bushor.2022.07.005,Counterfeit goods; Dupe influencer; Influencer marketing; Social media marketing; Trademark infringement,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses specific actions and recommendations to combat dupe influencers and counterfeit luxury goods, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making focused on structured approaches to achieve strategic goals.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Dupe influencers exploiting social media to peddle luxury fakes,2022
"Purpose: Marketers are focusing on the need for customer advocacy to influence other customers and drive consumption. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether online or digital advocacy influences customer decision-making related to the purchase of travel and tourism services. This paper will also identify the categories of influencers that stimulate purchase for travel and tourism. Influencers do want to know the kind of information customers are looking for. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a primary survey of travelers to understand their degree of dependence on online reviews while making hospitality consumption-related decisions. Findings: This paper looks at both influencer marketing and online reviews by consumers to understand consumption toward advocated brand. Influencers who are perceived as unbiased in their viewpoints are trending on social media. Consumers gain trust in reviews that disclose reviewer information, number of relevant reviews are present over a period and presence of both unbiased positive and negative recommendations related to the establishment and prices versus performance. Practical implications: Marketers and influencers alike can gain from the factors influencing consumer trust toward online advocacy and reviewed information. Originality/value: Research is relevant for all stakeholders as it highlights the fact that consumers are looking at online reviews and one does not have to be a famous personality to influence purchase. It is relevant for influencers, as it highlights reasons for trust and various information cues that consumers are looking for. Research also gives perspective to influencers to refine online strategy and gain trust of more followers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dutta K.; Sharma K.; Goyal T.,Tactical,10.1108/WHATT-09-2020-0123,Consumer trust; Customer’s digital advocacy; Electronic WOM; Influencer marketing; Online reviews,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract focuses on understanding consumer behavior in relation to online advocacy and reviews, which directly informs marketing strategies and campaigns to influence customer decision-making in the travel and tourism sector.

"This study aims at understanding the channels through which the students have become aware, the channels which they used to search for information on the schools, and the key factor that pushed them to apply for a given school. Through primary data research with n=788 respondents who are currently enrolled in VET across eight schools in Kosovo, the study has identified the critical importance of word-of-mouth through family & relatives, and friends in generating awareness for a given school and sharing information on the school offering. As critical elements to decide to apply for the school have been considered the applicants visit directly to the school to get informed more on the offering and the desire to get equipped with the given qualification the school offers. It is important to note the impact that parents have across all levels from brand awareness development to information search and decision making. The study provides pragmatic recommendations to school management on better optimizing their marketing efforts from a communication channel perspective, such as the importance of the open-days events of the school and the usage of the social media channels (especially Facebook) to communicate their offering. © 2022, Pro Global Science Association.

"Consumers use brands in many combinations, from mixing-and-matching multiple brands (e.g., Nike shoes, Puma shirt, and Asics shorts) to using products primarily or solely from one brand (e.g., Nike shoes, shirt, and shorts). This work explores how such combinations affect observers’ trust in another consumer’s recommendations. Comparing two combination types—mixed-brand combinations (where all/most branded products are from different brands) and dominant-brand combinations (where all/most branded products are from the same brand)—nine studies establish that observers tend to have less trust in recommendations from those who use dominant-brand combinations (studies 1A–1C). This is driven by inferences about how the products were chosen: observers believe others who use dominant-brand combinations placed relatively greater importance on the brand—a feature that often serves as a mental shortcut for choices—and therefore infer these consumers made quicker, less thoughtful decisions (studies 2A and 2B). While the effect diminishes when observers hold particularly favorable attitudes toward the focal brand (study 3), it can alter observers’ own downstream behaviors (e.g., social media following intentions, information seeking, and recommendation taking; studies 4A–4C). Together, the findings confirm that brand combinations elicit responses distinct from single brands, offering fruitful avenues for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.

"Mining for truly responsive customers has become an integral part of customer portfolio management, and, combined with operational tactics to reach these customers, requires an integrated approach to meeting customer needs that often involves the application of concepts from traditionally distinct fields: marketing, statistics, and operations research. This article brings such concepts together to address customer value and revenue maximisation as well as risk minimisation for direct marketing decision-making problems under uncertainty. We focus on customer lift optimisation given the uncertainty associated with lift estimation models, and develop risk management and operational tools for the multiple treatment (recommendation) problem using stochastic and robust optimisation techniques.

"This paper investigates the incentives of e-commerce platforms to show personalized recommendations and its effects on performance. A theoretical framework is developed that characterizes the optimal decision policy of a firm, given current state of shoppers. The key finding is that the firm must always show recommendations to shoppers in the high state above a certain price or value threshold. In the low state, recommending is optimal if the “salience effect” is above a threshold that maximizes discounted future stream of profits. An empirical model provides support to the theoretical findings, highlighting the reputation effects of personalized recommendations, using browsing and purchase data from a Finnish multi-product platform. While recommendations are associated with a 29% increase in firm revenue, relevance of such recommendations potentially boost revenue by a significant 30%. Furthermore, strong evidence is presented that consumer state is endogenous in firm revenue regressions. A three-step IV process extracts the direct effect of consumer state on revenue which shows positive association between reputation effects and firm performance. © 2021 The Author(s)",Basu S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101074,e-commerce; personalized recommendations; reputation effects,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implications of personalized recommendations on e-commerce performance, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on optimizing specific operational strategies to achieve defined targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Personalized product recommendations and firm performance,2021

"Tourists’ satisfaction plays an important role in their decision to return to their previous destinations. The complexity of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty, however, has been increasingly acknowledged in marketing thought and practice. The objective of this study is to explore and test the combined roles of perceived risk and destination knowledge in the satisfaction-loyalty intention relationship. The results indicate the direct effects of perceived risk on visitors’ satisfaction and loyalty intentions. Furthermore, perceived destination knowledge is positively related to visitors’ satisfaction and both the intention to make WOM (word-of-mouth) recommendations and to return. In particular, the effects of visitors’ satisfaction on intention to return and to make WOM recommendations become stronger through the positive moderating effect of perceived destination knowledge. The findings clarify the understanding of how perceived risk and destination knowledge can predict the satisfaction and destination loyalty of tourists. This paper provides a number of managerial implications for communication strategies to improve tourist loyalty. Management implications: This study reinforces established ideas for communication strategies to improve European tourist loyalty: Perceived risk is negatively related to both visitors’ satisfaction and the intention to return. Tourists’ satisfaction is positively related to the intention to recommend by WOM. A positive impact on intentional loyalty, perceived destination knowledge helps to increase tourists’ satisfaction.

"Problem definition: Sequential experiments that are deployed in a broad range of practices are characterized by an exploration-exploitation trade-off that is well understood when in each time period feedback is received only on the action that was selected in that period. However, in many practical settings, additional information may become available between decision epochs. We study the performance that one may achieve when leveraging such auxiliary information and the design of algorithms that effectively do so without prior knowledge of the information arrival process. Methodology/results: Our formulation considers a broad class of distributions that are informative about rewards from actions and allows auxiliary observations from these distributions to arrive according to an arbitrary and a priori unknown process. When it is known how to map auxiliary observations to reward estimates, we characterize the best achievable performance as a function of the information arrival process. In terms of achieving optimal performance, we establish that upper confidence bound and Thompson sampling algorithms possess natural robustness with respect to the information arrival process, which uncovers a novel property of these popular algorithms. When the mappings connecting auxiliary observations and rewards are a priori unknown, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition under which auxiliary information allows performance improvement and devise an adaptive policy (termed 2UCBs) that guarantees near optimality. We use a data set from a large media site to analyze the value that may be captured by leveraging auxiliary observations in the design of content recommendations. Managerial implications: Our study highlights the importance of utilizing auxiliary information in the design of sequential experiments and characterizes how salient features of the auxiliary information stream impact performance. Our study also emphasizes the risk in processing auxiliary information using nonadaptive approaches that are predicated on correct interpretation of this information, as opposed to deploying flexible, adaptive methods. © 2022 INFORMS.",Gur Y.; Momeni A.,Tactical,10.1287/msom.2022.1116,experiments; OM-marketing interface; pricing and revenue management; service operations; stochastic methods,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the design of algorithms and methodologies for leveraging auxiliary information in sequential experiments, which implies structured decision-making processes to improve performance.

"The research aims to assess the extent of overtourism in Budapest. The analysis first introduces a system of criteria for a sustainable destination, highlighting the capacity network, institutional system, structural aspects, and architectural infrastructure load of a sustainable region. A survey of the relevant literature reveals the increasing scholarly attention paid to the phenomenon of overtourism, while singling out Budapest as one of the most affected urban areas. One potential explanation for Budapest's situation is that it developed as a result of a decreasing ability of the central districts to absorb a growing visitor load, along with a decline in the seasonal distribution of tourism. The current situation could also have emerged because the respective negative consequences were not counteracted by the inclusion of local residents. The residential segments and inhabitants were not allocated a share in the tourism-related income and, despite the steady growth in visitor numbers, they were not consulted either. The in-depth interviews with the residents of Erzsébetvâros confirm that the intensity of the irritation level indicated on the Irridex scale developed by Doxy (1975) can be divided into various stages with time. As part of the research, the authors surveyed 510 international visitors concerning tourism activities. Furthermore, the study proposes solutions to the problems related to overtourism and presents a survey of relevant recommendations by international organizations. To address overtourism, the capital requires quick decisions. Demand needs to be diversified; new sustainable tourism products need to be introduced. Visitors to Budapest should be extended in space and time, while the interest of domestic tourists in the city should be raised through strong marketing activities. Stricter regulations should be adopted for local entrepreneurs; more support should be given to contactless solutions (Jamal-Budke 2020). In the post-COVID-19 period, the overtourism is reduced and the search for close-to-nature experiences is replaced by creative tourism (Nagy et al. 2018). © 2021.

"Brand resonance is a marketing concept under-explored in the performing arts context. This paper responds by analysing focus group findings from a large Opera group, “Big Opera[1]” (For research integrity and anonymity requirements of focus group research, the company pseudonym is Big Opera) on how decision-makers can enhance brand resonance. Opera patronage was dwindling before the COVID-19 pandemic, which was further crystallized during the pandemic. As the performing arts sector tries to revive, it is useful to understand how brand resonance concepts can be used to reinvigorate patronage at the opera. A qualitative study of four opera focus groups, which included 24 participants with varying levels of attendance was conducted to examine brand resonance. The study reveals that when customers have brand attachment and love, developed through intense experiences at the opera, facilitated by engagement with the brand, and community, then brand loyalty develops for the opera by intention to re-purchase. The paper contributes to the literature by making recommendations on how to enhance brand resonance thereby increasing attendance. Intense experiences at the opera and engagement can be enhanced by offering packaged deals, such as accommodation and dinner, or drinks and canapés packages, backstage access, the development of a social club, social media brand community and loyalty programs to increase brand loyalty. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Hall E.; Menzies J.; Zutshi A.; Creed A.,Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12743,attendance; brand resonance; focus group; opera; performing arts,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses specific strategies and recommendations to increase brand resonance and attendance at the opera, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Opera participants’ perceptions of brand resonance,2022
"Market diversification, one critical means by which tourism-dependent small island states can maintain sector resilience and destination life cycle stability, requires understanding of the destination loyalty of strategic new inbound markets such as China. An online survey of 1260 Chinese adults with previous travel experience to the Maldives identified positive proclivities with respect to revisitation and recommendation intentions as well as agreement that Chinese visitors were well catered for. Sample diversity, however, was demonstrated by cluster analysis, which revealed dominant ‘highly loyal’ (31.2%) and ‘loyal’ (37.1%) segments along with specialized clusters ambivalent about the catering (14.3%) or the revisitation intent (17.4%). Loyalty was strongly associated with older, married and higher income visitors who were aware that the Maldives is an Islamic country and who included the capital city of Male in their itinerary. Such information is invaluable for assisting target marketing and product development strategies, but situates in a context of bilateral asymmetry in which the Chinese government can destabilize small island tourism through decisions that curtail visitation by otherwise loyal residents. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Weaver D.; Tang C.; Lawton L.; Liu Y.,Tactical,10.1080/14616688.2019.1623300,China; destination life cycle; destination loyalty; Small island resilience; the Maldives; 中国,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the loyalty segments of Chinese tourists to the Maldives and suggests implications for target marketing and product development strategies.

To address this gap, this exploratory study surveyed Indian consumers’ social media behaviors. Observations from 313 Indian consumers were collected to compare how their social media behaviors for consumer decision-making have changed since the COVID-19 pandemic started. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test mean differences in social media behaviors prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic began. The findings demonstrated increased usage of social media as a tool for consumer decision-making.

"A significant area of Social Computing is the Social Network Service (SNS), known as Social Network Applications. In recent years, researchers have commonly used SNS as an instrument for linking and communicating. Homestay travel has been prevalent for a long time with the rise of social media. The goal of this study is to examine the influence of Social Network Service functions on homestay travel intention in Vietnam. Fourteen Social Network Service functions were summarized from the literature review and used as the variables influencing the purpose of homestay travel to develop a five-point Likert scale questionnaire for convenience sampling to perform an online survey. For further study, two hundred and twenty valid respondents were included. The GM(1, N) analysis showed interest sharing, photo sharing, and video sharing as the first to third most principal factors in their highly seasoned weighting towards homestay travel intention. On the other side, helping decision, helping interaction, and helping planning as the last three lists of weighting scores. Besides, multiple regression analysis shows that offering recommendations, helping planning, and sharing interest simultaneously predict homestay travel intention while the others don’t. That means consumers would heavily rely upon the functions of sharing interest of social network services to evaluate their traveling options. It is proposed that homestay traveling vendors should pay more attention to the marketing of previous travelers’ experiential interests to provoke the awareness of customers. © 2022 Institute of Information Science.

"It has become a marketing trend for marketers to use influencers to advertise and sell products because influencers can affect the attitudes and decision-making of other social media users. Most previous research on influencer marketing has concentrated on its effectiveness as a promotional tool. In contrast, there have been limited studies on the influencer-social media user relationship. The relationship that influencers have with other social media users is the foundation for the success of influencer marketing. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the factors that affect the influencers’ relationships with other users. In accordance with the concept of information relevance, this study presents a model relating the various attributes of influencer-generated content with emotional attachment and information quality to examine the relationship between influencers and other social media users. The findings of a survey of 280 respondents indicate that the interestingness, novelty, reliability, and understandability of influencer-generated content can effectively increase users’ emotional attachment to influencers. Reliability and understandability can also have a significant positive impact on information quality. This eventually inclines social media users to follow or recommend influencers to others, which can increase the popularity of influencers. This study helps researchers and marketers advance their understanding of influencers’ relationships with other social media users and offers management-related recommendations for influencers and marketers. © 2022 by the authors.

"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of sustainability certifications on consumer preferences. The study investigates whether product certifications have a significant influence on consumer preferences and examines which certificate groups work best from a marketer's perspective for matching the different consumer preferences. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a quantitative survey approach, based on a conjoint analysis carried out in the Brazilian juice market. Findings: The results of 210 respondents indicate that the certifications chosen generally increase the evaluation of products. The effects, however, differ significantly between the three segments identified, especially between the two most important ones that have a combined market share of almost 90%. Our results show that demographic differences between the clusters are only marginal, as are the specific certification preferences, with a small advantage for organic certification. Research limitations/implications: The certificates chosen serve as an example that represents the various categories. The utility of similar certificates of the same category might be different. The scope of the research is also limited to the market for ready-to-drink juice. Practical implications: Using a dual targeting strategy, this study makes relevant recommendations for managing product certification. On the one hand, managers should consider a highly priced, certified product and, on the other, a low priced, uncertified product for satisfying identified demands. Decisions with regard to certification differentiation should mostly rely on the specific costs of the process because of limited consumer differentiation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on the influence that product certification has on consumer preferences by adding to the matter of certificate choice, especially from a marketer's perspective. Resolving this issue is important for facilitating the choice of those certificates that contribute most toward increasing consumer preference. Little research has been conducted into different certification groups and categories or the joint appearance of their different labels. Most of the research being carried out is aimed at the food market in developed countries, particularly in North America and Europe. Research in an emerging economy, therefore, introduces new scientific insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Prell M.; Zanini M.T.; Caldieraro F.; Migueles C.,Tactical,10.1108/MIP-12-2019-0616,Certification; Labeling; Product preference; Sustainability marketing; Sustainable certifications,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on how product certifications influence consumer preferences and offers recommendations for product pricing and certification strategies, which are tactical aspects of marketing decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Sustainability certifications and product preference,2020
"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online reviews are important sources of information that help consumers decide which products and services to buy. Although C2C reviews in video format (e.g., on YouTube) have become increasingly popular, research remains focused primarily on textual reviews. This article emphasizes the importance of C2C video reviews in influencing consumer outcomes through parasocial interaction, a special—albeit one-sided—connection with reviewers. Interactivity and self-disclosure are suggested as online communication techniques reviewers can use to foster parasocial interaction with their viewers in a single encounter. Parasocial interaction is further established as a psychological mechanism that underlines the impacts of interactivity and self-disclosure on source credibility, leading to improved consumer purchase intentions. The authors also propose that strong parasocial interaction with reviewers exerts a particularly powerful influence on the purchase decisions of consumers who experience low levels of decision confidence, while arguing for the importance of C2C video reviews in guiding the decisions of various consumer groups. Research recommendations reveal how managers can encourage consumers to create and share video reviews on different platforms and offer guidance on the ways companies can foster parasocial interaction through firm-related marketing communications. © The Author(s) 2022.",Penttinen V.; Ciuchita R.; Čaić M.,Tactical,10.1177/10949968221102825,C2C reviews; interactivity; parasocial interaction; self-disclosure; video reviews,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,The abstract discusses the influence of C2C video reviews on consumer purchase intentions and suggests communication techniques (interactivity and self-disclosure) that can be employed by reviewers.

"In-store displays aim to boost sales of both utilitarian and hedonic products. Noting typical differences in the information processing and purchase behavior evoked by these product types, and building on congruency theory principles, the authors propose that different types of in-store displays (i.e., island, end-of-aisle, or shelf signage) are more appropriate for utilitarian versus hedonic products, and the use of price or product promotions might reinforce these effects. With a database that combines three data sources (scanner, observational, and survey), this article presents an analysis of a market share model at the SKU level. The results confirm that in-store displays have differential effects on sales, depending on their characteristics; congruency between the decision-making process of utilitarian versus hedonic products and the characteristics of in-store display types moderates their effectiveness in terms of SKU sales. Shelf signage strongly increases the sales of utilitarian products, whereas island and end-of-aisle displays increase sales of hedonic product categories more effectively. The use of congruent promotions creates synergistic influences that reinforce these effects. In particular, price promotions improve the impact of shelf signage on utilitarian products, and product promotions strengthen the impacts of island and end-of-aisle displays on hedonic products. These results extend prior research on in-store marketing actions and the nature of utilitarian versus hedonic products, as well as providing recommendations for retailers and manufacturers seeking to optimize their retail space and commercial budgets. © 2020 New York University",Garrido-Morgado Á.; González-Benito Ó.; Martos-Partal M.; Campo K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretai.2020.10.005,Congruency principle; Dual information processing mode; Hedonic product; In-store display; Utilitarian product,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the effects of in-store displays on sales of utilitarian and hedonic products, focusing on specific marketing tactics such as display types and promotions.

"Purpose: This study investigates how Danmu (danmaku) technological features (DTFs) of recommendation vlogs (rec-vlogs) impact consumer experiences and decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique with a sample of 422 viewers of Danmu-enabled rec-vlogs to examine the proposed model. Findings: The DTFs positively affect consumer loyalty intentions through the mediation of social presence and immersion. Also, vlogger-product congruency significantly moderates the relationship between social presence and immersion. Originality/value: With the increasing popularity of vlogs, retailers have adopted the vlog as a new marketing channel to connect with consumers. Although a growing body of studies focuses on this phenomenon, little is known about how DTFs help to increase consumer loyalty toward using rec-vlogs as product information sources. Anchored on the stimulus–organism–response framework, this study investigates how pseudo-synchronicity, Danmu-content congruency and parallelism, three DTFs used in rec-vlogs, impact consumer experiences of social presence and immersion, eventually influence the consumers' loyalty intentions toward rec-vlogs. The authors also examine whether the effect of social presence on immersion is contingent on vlogger-product congruency.

"This article explores the role of information in high risk consumer decision making. Forty-two qualitative interviews were undertaken with international non-EU postgraduates when making the high risk decision to study in a UK Business School. Prospective international postgraduates moved iteratively through the stages in Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process model and learnt from the search process they had undertaken in a continuous cyclical manner. Word-of-mouth recommendations were the most influential sources of information gathered, and online sources were perceived to be credible regardless of their origins. The perception of risk impacted the rigour of the information search process. An iterative decision making cycle model is proposed with Kuhlthau’s model and word of mouth information at its core, which reflects the connectedness of individuals in this digital era.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study resides in a better understanding of the relationship between the use of traditional operators, online travel agencies, such as Booking.com and Expedia, comparators, tour operators and traditional travel agencies, airlines, new non-tourist companies like Google and the use of sharing economy platforms to obtain information about a travel destination. Design/methodology/approach: Applying an analysis to 13,243 tourists from 19 European countries, a binomial logit analysis was carried out with the latest version of the SPSS statistical analysis program. Findings: The use of Expedia and Booking.com has a positive effect on the use of sharing economy platforms to obtain information about travel destinations. However, it can also be observed how the use of Google, Facebook, tour operators and travel agencies, airlines and Twitter can have a negative effect. Practical implications: The study provides interesting recommendations for destinations to be able to design better marketing strategies which focus on cognitive components of the destination image in different information sources. Originality/value: Tourists search for information that helps them make better decisions when it comes to choosing a travel destination and they do so using different channels that have evolved over time. The proliferation of internet platforms has transformed the way tourists search for information and consequently the way the secondary image of destination is formed. The sharing economy plays an important role in this new tourism ecosystem.

"Every year about 95% of new products fail for a simple reason that most customers do not have the time or energy to think about the advantages or disadvantages of the products they place in their shopping carts, so they rely on shortcuts to make a purchase decision such as quality, beauty and excellence of product packaging. Packaging becomes part and parcel of our contemporary life especially in the continuous development for the conception of marketing. It becomes one of the basic dimensions for the concept of production because it plays big role to emphasize the mental image of the product on the consumer’s side. The importance of packaging leads several of marketing thinkers to consider it as enclosed marketing mix elements and one of corner stone in which goods depend on its success process. Therefore, the current study aims to study the concept and the importance of packaging and its role in attracting the consumer’s attention, and to determine the difficulties that the companies undergo in the field of packaging. The study depends on assembling the primary data on questionnaire designed especially for this purpose, and distributed to 600 consumers in Riyadh city. In addition to that secondary data is collected from resources related to the study subject. Simple statistical analysis is used to analyze the data. The results of research confirm the big role for the packaging in consumer attraction in study sample with all dimensions (design, color, size, and shape). The most important recommendation of the study is that to adopt a clear policy for packing in industrial organizations that cope with high technological development and the fast changing in consumer's tastes.

"Purpose: Customers are interested in finding service recommendations, reviews and word of mouth using social networking platforms. These service reviews are useful for enhancing service quality, level of information and engagement, and purchase intention of customers. The purpose of this paper is to uncover which social networking platform is more useful for the exchange of service reviews and how organizations are improving purchase intention as well as service quality in the light of customer’s reviews/experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The study is exploratory in nature because it aims to understand the use of social networking platforms for enhancing service quality and the purchase intention of customers using a purposive sampling technique. To meet the objective of this study, non-directive and semi-structured interviews have been conducted with customers and marketing teams in the banking sector and internet service providers. Findings: The results show that social networking websites are helpful in fostering responsiveness, awareness, assurance, reliability and empathy. However, respondents revealed serious concerns regarding the privacy of personal and financial information especially in the context of the banking sector. It has been found that official Facebook pages of service-providing organizations, open and closed local community Facebook groups, sponsored ads and promotional advertisements on Facebook, WhatsApp groups and YouTube video comments are more frequently used to exchange service reviews (i.e. influence the process of purchase decision) among friends, friends of friends, family members and the general public. The selected customers and market team respondents revealed that local community Facebook groups (i.e. open groups and closed groups) have gained prime importance for enhancing service quality and purchase decisions. Practical implications: The effective and well-organized use of social networking platforms can foster service reviews, word of mouth, level of service awareness, interactive communication, intention to purchase, social influence, social trust and services quality. Furthermore, online social networking platforms require a lower level of advertisement costs and offer huge amounts of information, discussions, enquires, service stories, word of mouth, transactions and interactions of consumers. Originality/value: The present study is exploratory in nature because it selects an under-researched issue regarding the use of social networking applications to enhance levels of purchase intention and service quality. There is limited literature which has combined the multiple constructs in a single study (i.e. social media platforms, cross-platform platforms, service quality and purchase intention of consumers). Most of the previous studies are dependent on various dimensions of service quality (i.e. “reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empath and tangibles”).

"In spite of vast business potential, targeted advertising in public transportation systems is a grossly unexplored research area. For instance, SBS Transit in Singapore can reach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than $35 million. To bridge the gap, we propose a probabilistic data model that captures the motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an advertisement among the passengers. In particular, we leverage hundreds of millions of bus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as the extent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model, we study a top-k retrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation, which acts as a primitive operator to support various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to support real-Time decision making.

"Social relationships have long been recognised for their role in shaping consumers' opinions and decisions in the traditional offline world. While the number of people participating in online activities and purchases is continuously growing, there is a lack of understanding on whether and how explicitly established social connections might affect product evaluation and adoption in an online environment. Yet, online social relations are notably distinct from their offline counterparts. In this study, using a dataset collected from an online social networking and rating site, we conduct a comparative event analysis around the establishment of online social connections. Our findings provide supporting evidence that explicit online social relations positively influence users' product ratings and play a significant role in expanding a user's product adoption into new product categories over time, which offers important implications for product marketing strategies and design of online recommendation systems.

"Consumer return rates have been steadily rising in recent years, resulting in growing costs for retailers who must manage the returns process and the disposition of returned products. This cost pressure is driven in part by extremely generous return policies, such as giving consumers a full refund upon return. Interestingly, this common retail practice of full refunds is inconsistent with the recommendations of many analytical models of returns, which nearly always show that a partial refund is optimal. Such inconsistencies between theory and practice might arise when the decision drivers included in the analytical models do not match the decision drivers in practice. It might also be the case that retailers are overly optimistic about the value that consumers assign to a full refund, and thus assume that the value of such a policy outweighs its costs. In this paper, we use data collected from eBay, where identical products are sold with different return policies, to investigate these open questions in the literature. We analyze both the return policy drivers from the retailer's perspective and the return policy value from the consumer's perspective. Our results suggest that the value of a full refund policy to consumers may not be as large as one might expect, and it also exhibits a large heterogeneity across buyers with different levels of online purchase experience. In addition, we provide empirical evidence for what has long been suspected by online retailers – that a non-refundable forward shipping charge quickly erodes any value that consumers assign to return policies. The generality of our results is limited by the fact that eBay differs from traditional retail contexts in many respects, including the fact that eBay buyers may not be representative of the general buyer population. However, our study of how eBay consumers value free returns provides new insights into an understudied area, and it can serve as a starting point for future studies of the value of return policies in other retail contexts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Shang G.; Pekgün P.; Ferguson M.; Galbreth M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jom.2017.07.001,Consumer returns; eBay; Marketing-operations interface; Online retailing,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses specific return policies and their implications for retailers and consumers, which aligns with tactical decision-making regarding marketing strategies and customer engagement.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,How much do online consumers really value free product returns?

"The current research aims at revealing the relationship of the brand image, through its dimensions (brand image, confidence in the brand, the commitment towards the brand, the recommendation of the brand towards others), in the involvement with the purchase decision through its dimensions (The mental effort exerted in the search for information, evaluating between the alternatives, and for choosing the preferred brand). The problem of research has identified the main question of the current study, which is ‘What role does the brand image of the brand play in the customer's purchase decision?’ For the purposes of achieving the study objectives, a sample of hypotheses has been formulated. In order to verify the validity of the main hypothesis, several tests were carried out. The researcher used the questionnaire as a means of obtaining data. The study used the analytical descriptive approach as a method of analysis, which is composed of two measures: brand image and purchase involvement. The descriptive method was used to reinforce and strengthen these concepts and to focus on the University students as the largest segment that are concerned with the brands of sportswear. The study was applied to a random sample of 485 university students. The data were analyzed using a set of statistical methods and the results were extracted using statistical program SPSS v.20. The research has reached a number of conclusions, one of the most important of which is that achieving the customer's confidence in the brand is positively guided by the research sample by adopting the customer's confidence that the brand will not deceive him and that he is always at his service. The research has also researched to a number of recommendation, the most important of which is that the marketing managers should convince the customers that the brand has a set of attributes and benefits that can satisfy and meet their needs and aspirations. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

"Sales management plays an important role in firms' profit. Its main goal is to determine the best time to present insurance customers with prices, insurers, bundling strategies, and the intermediary's recommendation. In this study, a triangular approach was used. For attribute selection, three focus groups were performed with insurance customers and intermediaries. Conjoint analysis was carried out by presenting the attributes in three different orders. Primacy and recency effects were detected; a transfer or anchor effect was also found related to the importance of the attributes preceding and succeeding a given attribute. According to the findings, salespeople can improve their approach to customers by decreasing the importance given to price and increasing the positive impact of bundling strategies and the intermediary's recommendation in sales.

Findings: Personal taste was found to influence choice of a sparkling wine rather than another type of beverage, and selection of a particular style and brand of sparkling wine. Country or region of origin was found to be important, often linked to the product being champagne. Brand image, reputation and symbolism were found to influence purchase decisions (sometimes linked to consumption occasion), especially for purchases of gifts. Advice, recommendations and expert reviews, and consumption occasion also were found to influence purchase decisions. Price was found to influence style and brand of sparkling wine purchased. A high price was found to be a barrier for some participants, while other participants were found to avoid sparkling wines priced below some particular level. Thematic analysis enabled development of a preliminary model of purchasing preferences. Research limitations/implications: Being exploratory in nature, findings cannot be generalised. Further studies are required to confirm the preliminary model and to evaluate the validity and significance of proposed relationships. Practical implications: Findings suggest a producer could benefit from marketing a range of sparkling wines to cater to different tastes, occasions and gift purchases. Findings also confirm the importance of marketers pursuing opportunities to obtain and promote favourable expert reviews for their sparkling wines, and of identifying and promoting regional distinctiveness. Originality/value: The first comprehensive model of sparkling wine consumers’ purchasing preferences has been developed. Empirical testing would enable refinement and enhance understanding. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Verdonk N.; Wilkinson J.; Culbert J.; Ristic R.; Pearce K.; Wilkinson K.,Tactical,10.1108/IJWBR-10-2015-0048,Australia; Consumer behaviour; Psychometric/qualitative; Survey research; Wines,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses specific factors that influence purchasing preferences for sparkling wine, indicating structured decision-making and targeted marketing strategies.

"Aim/Purpose This paper describes an empirical examination of how users' willingness to dis-close personal data is influenced by the amount of information provided on landing pages - standalone web pages created explicitly for marketing or adver-tising campaigns. Background Provision of information is a central construct in the IS discipline. Content is a term commonly used to describe the information made available by a website or other electronic medium. A pertinent debate among scholars and practitioners relate to the behavioral impact of content volume: Specifically, does a greater amount of information elicit engagement and compliance, or the other way around? Methodology A series of large-scale web experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) were conduct-ed employing a between-subjects design and A/B testing. Two variants of land-ing pages, long and short, were created based on relevant behavioral theories. Both variants included an identical form to collect users' information, but dif-ferent amounts of provided content. User traffic was generated using Google AdWords and randomized between the page using Unbounce.com. Relevant usage metrics, such as response rate (called ""conversion rate""), location, and visit time were recorded. Contribution This research contributes to the body of knowledge on information provision and its effectiveness and carries practical and theoretical implications to practi-tioners and scholars in Information Systems, Informing Science, Communica-tions, Digital Marketing, and related fields. Findings Analyses of results show that the shorter landing pages had significantly higher conversion rates across all locations and times. Findings demonstrate a negative correlation between the content amount and consumer behavior, suggesting that users who had less information were more inclined to provide their data. Recommendations for Practitioners At a practical level, results can empirically support business practices, design considerations, and content strategy by informing practitioners on the role of content in online commerce. Recommendation for Researchers Findings suggest that the amount of content plays a significant role in online decision making and effective informing. They also contradict prior research on trust, persuasion, and security. This study advances research on the paradoxical relationship between the increased level of information and online decision-making and indicates that contrary to earlier work, not all persuasion theories are effective online. Impact on Society Understanding how information drives behavior has implications in many do-mains (civic engagement, health, education, and more). This has relevance to system design and public communication in both online and offline contexts. Future Research Using this research as a starting point, future research can examine the impact of content in other contexts, as well as other behavioral drivers (such as demo-graphic data). This can lead to theoretical, methodological, and practical rec-ommendations. © 2018 Informing Science Institute.",Dvir N.; Gafni R.,Tactical,10.28945/4015,Consumer behavior; Content strategy; Deci-sion making; E-commerce; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Informing science; Marketing; User engagement,5.0,,15,0,Informing Science Institute,"The research focuses on how the amount of information on landing pages affects user behavior and data disclosure, which aligns with structured decision-making in marketing campaigns and user engagement strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,When less is more: Empirical study of the relation between consumer behavior and information provision on commercial landing pages,2018
"This paper shares the details of an evaluation plan from an interdisciplinary climate change project that developed decision support tools (DSTs) DST = Decision Support Tool. 2 for agricultural advisors and farmers. It showcases how evaluation enhanced the project work by providing opportunities for the team to reflect on and use data to improve performance. The plan included both formative and summative approaches, team member interviews to assess team functioning, usability testing of DSTs, outreach and marketing campaign evaluation. Outreach evaluation included surveying those reached, monitoring project website traffic, and tracking and mapping outreach details. Marketing evaluation included pre-testing campaign materials, assessing open and click rates of email campaign, and monitoring associated traffic to website. The Useful to Usable (U2U) team was generally high functioning, but team interviews allowed the evaluators and leaders to discern factors that were influencing intended outcomes, respond to needs, assign resources, and catalyze activities that were crucial in shaping the outcomes. Usability testing surfaced issues related to default values and search and help features that were addressed by the team and resulted in improved usability. Outreach evaluation found geographic and methodological gaps that were filled, resulting in more target audiences reached and more effective methods used (e.g., hands-on events). Marketing evaluation allowed for improving contact lists over time and improving campaign messaging before deployment. Evaluators and project leaders working on similar projects may adapt or utilize methods detailed in this paper, along with the recommendations, while designing and implementing improvement-oriented evaluation plans. © 2016 The Authors",Klink J.; Koundinya V.; Kies K.; Robinson C.; Rao A.; Berezowitz C.; Widhalm M.; Prokopy L.,Tactical,10.1016/j.crm.2016.11.003,Interdisciplinary team; Marketing campaign; Mixed methods evaluation; Outreach evaluation; Stakeholder engagement; Usability testing,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of decision support tools and the methods used to improve project performance, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on structured approaches and specific targets like usability testing and outreach evaluation.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Enhancing interdisciplinary climate change work through comprehensive evaluation,2017
"Innovative marketers can now leverage augmented reality to craft immersive brand experiences, create more interactive advertising, and enable consumers to experience products and spaces in novel ways. Augmented reality (AR) is the practice of displaying digital information over people's real-time view of objects, people, or spaces in the physical world. While AR can play a valuable role in integrated marketing programs, little is known about the practice and how to execute effective AR programs in the marketplace. We address this gap by presenting a framework that describes the active and passive ingredients of augmented reality. We then describe the basic design decisions that marketers need to make when planning an augmented reality campaign. In addition, we explain how understanding and addressing the dynamics between various active and passive AR ingredients can help marketers to optimize their AR campaigns and enhance various types of consumer engagement: user-brand engagement, user-user engagement, and user-bystander engagement. Through our framework and analysis, we develop eight actionable recommendations-described with the acronym ENTANGLE-marketing managers can use to design immersive AR experiences that maximize consumer engagement. © 2015 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.",Scholz J.; Smith A.N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.bushor.2015.10.003,Advertising; Augmented reality; Branding; Consumer engagement; Interactive marketing; Mobile marketing; Social media; User-generated content; Virtual reality,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of augmented reality (AR) in marketing, focusing on specific design decisions and actionable recommendations to enhance consumer engagement.

"Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM) programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide them valuable assistance in doing so. The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network-level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1 ) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Chica M.; Rand W.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.15.0443,Agent-based modeling; Freemium business model; Marketing decision support systems; Targeting and referrals; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract describes a decision support system (DSS) designed to assist marketers in implementing word-of-mouth (WOM) programs and optimizing premium conversions through data-driven targeting and reward policies.

"In an attempt to market their services and connect with potential users, and particularly young people, many libraries are opening accounts on social media platforms. Research suggests a contradiction between the advice relating to marketing and that regarding the use of social media in libraries, with the former emphasising the importance of the user at the centre of all considerations and the latter placing library staff as central to decisions. In this work we attempt to re-address this imbalance by surveying the current state of library activity on Twitter and, by means of questionnaires, investigate the experiences and motivations of librarians (n=58) in using social media and whether students (n=498) are willing to engage with the library in this manner and why. Our findings confirm that libraries in the sector are indeed struggling to foster interest in their social media activities and go some way to understanding why this is so, leading to a number of conclusions and recommendations for practitioners. © The Author(s) 2016.",Jones M.J.; Harvey M.,Tactical,10.1177/0961000616668959,Library 2.0; marketing; social media,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses the current activities of libraries on social media and investigates the motivations of librarians and willingness of students to engage, which aligns with tactical decisions related to user engagement and marketing strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Library 2.0: The effectiveness of social media as a marketing tool for libraries in educational institutions,2019
"The concept of social media is top of the agenda for many organizations today. Decision makers, as well as marketers, try to identify ways in which organizations can make profitable use of social media platforms. The adoption of social media in marketing communication campaigns to carry the marketing communication message to the target audiences remains a challenge to organizations in the motor industry. The purpose of this paper was to establish an understanding of the online social media tools used by car dealerships in their marketing communication strategies and campaigns. In achieving the purpose of this paper, a qualitative research approach using semi-structured in-depth interviews with marketing personnel of different car dealerships in Gauteng province, South Africa was followed. In this paper, a qualitative content analysis was used to analyze primary data using Atlas ti version 10 computer software.

"Successful crowdfunding campaigns are multifaceted in nature and depend on marketing and organizational features. This study identifies the most appealing factors and analyzes the results through a multi-theory approach as follows. First, contrary to altruism and warm-glow giving theories, crowdfunding to support social impact projects does not perform well. Second, fixed campaigns, small-sized projects, and prolonged campaigns are more likely to be funded, in line with goal-setting theory. Additionally, the resource-based view of firms clarifies the importance of having large entrepreneurial teams. Further, narrative theories about persuasion and information processing provide insights into why detailed text descriptions are more persuasive than pitch videos.

"This study is about determining the different consumer segments in online shopping platforms. Consumer segmentation is a marketing strategy which involves firstly dividing customers into groups based on their underlying characteristics, needs and interests, and then designing and implementing strategies to target them. One of the most common types of segmentation approaches is behavioural segmentation analysis in which consumers are grouped based on their certain behavioural characteristics such as decision making, spending, usage, etc. This study carried out behavioural segmentation analysis based on real e-commerce transaction records of 10,000 online customers and found five different types of online consumer segments which are opportunist customers, transient customers, need-based shoppers, skeptical newcomers and repetitive purchasers. Behavioural characteristics of each segment were discussed in detail and recommendations were made about how to approach to each segment in order to increase their online shopping rates. Understanding the behavioural characteristics of each segment will enable the selling companies to develop marketing strategies accordingly. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Huseynov F.; Yildirim S.Ö.,Tactical,10.1504/IJEBR.2017.085549,B2C e-commerce; behavioural segmentation analysis; market segmentation; online consumer behaviour; online shopping; segmentation analysis; Turkey; two step cluster analysis,5.0,,15,0,Inderscience Publishers,"The study focuses on behavioral segmentation of online consumers, which involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable marketing strategies aimed at specific consumer segments.

"Due to the sweeping influence of capitalism, most food processing is now done through standardized production workflows in order to quickly replicate and churn out a large quantity of products. This has led to an increasing number of homogenized and delocalized products flooding the market and a disconnection between consumers and local food producers. Penghu outlying island is rich in unique local agricultural products but seriously lacks brand images and channel strategies, as manifested in an unstable demand and supply, a high degree of homogeneity (in products) and the majority of farmers producing and selling their products autonomously. This study applies the local food system and actor-network theory as the basis of theoretical frameworks as well as agricultural practices in Penghu as the research object. We used field investigation, in-depth interview and the means-end chain method to examine important contextual factors' influence on the local agricultural food system, important actors and challenges and key influential factors for local brand value that affect the development of the local agricultural food system in Penghu outlying island. The actor-network perceptual map of local brand value proposed in this study can help agricultural practitioners when making decisions and can formulate strategies for their products to increase the product visibility and recognition. This perceptual map can also facilitate the expansion of the target customers and channel distributions suitable for individual agricultural products. Our study presents the following recommendations: increase the manpower of agricultural practices through the working holiday approach; local government should provide support enabling agriculture producers to gain professional knowledge in marketing; and agriculture producers should form cooperatives which focus on the unique local agricultural products that are produced and marketed locally in Penghu. © 2018 by the authors.",Tang J.-W.; Chen M.-L.; Chiu T.-H.,Tactical,10.3390/su10114186,Actor-network theory; Local brand value; Local food system; Outlying island agriculture,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses specific strategies for improving the local agricultural food system in Penghu, including recommendations for brand value enhancement and marketing practices.

"Many successful companies spend substantial time and effort engaging with potential consumers on social media sites. They determine how consumers spend their time online and develop interesting content to increase awareness and enjoyment of the brand—often only to lose those potential customers because the purchase process becomes too difficult once consumers have decided to buy the product. New technology recently introduced by third-party vendors allows companies to offer a sales option directly on social media websites such as Facebook and Instagram. In this article, we present the effects on the consumer decision process created by the ‘Buy Now’ option across the consideration, evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase stages. We compare and contrast three distinct decision models: (1) traditional media only, (2) traditional media and social media with only a communication capability, and (3) traditional media and social media with the added function of immediate purchase. We argue that though the possibility of buying on social media will decrease the number of brands considered and evaluated, the number of purchases and amount of brand advocacy will increase significantly due to the ease of purchase. We conclude with some recommendations on future research. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Lindsey-Mullikin J.; Borin N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.bushor.2017.03.005,Brand social media; Consumer decision-making process; Digital marketing; Retail social media; Social media sales,5.0,,20,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a 'Buy Now' option on social media, which aligns with tactical decision-making to optimize the consumer purchase process and enhance user engagement.

"Despite the rise of emerging markets as lucrative destinations for business expansion, marketing literature in this area is largely anecdotal and conceptual. Further, owing to the largely unorganized retail structure in emerging markets, managers tend to make sub-optimal marketing-mix decisions by taking an aggregate view of their distribution network. In this study, we develop an econometric model to help firms develop a multichannel distribution strategy in emerging markets while accounting for (a) own-marketing mix, (b) competitive actions, (c) brand-level heterogeneity, and (d) dependencies that may arise between product offerings. The proposed model is tested on longitudinal data from a large Indian CPG manufacturer. The results indicate that firms must consider store format-specific distribution elasticities (as opposed to aggregate effects), especially in an emerging market, where the role of distribution is critical in brand success. Further, depending on the offering, price (own- and cross-) and advertising elasticities could vary even though the brand is essentially the same. Also, we find that there are significant dependencies between product forms that need to be considered when designing the marketing mix. Finally, we provide re-allocation recommendations to help managers choose the level of store format distribution in order to maximize profits. The proposed distribution re-allocation strategy resulted in an average of 7.7% increase in profits across three product forms for the focal firm. © 2014.",Kumar V.; Sunder S.; Sharma A.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretai.2014.08.005,Distribution elasticity; Emerging markets; Marketing mix; Multichannel retailing; Product forms; Store formats,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on developing a multichannel distribution strategy and suggests re-allocation recommendations for managers, which are tactical decisions that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Leveraging Distribution to Maximize Firm Performance in Emerging Markets,2015

"We use a general cellular automata model to study the consumer decision-making process. Within this general model we use three different rules governing word-of-mouth communication (w-o-m), one majority rule and two unanimity rules, and ask the question if differences between these three w-o-m rules, introduced on the microscopic level, will manifest on the macroscopic level. We show that in the model with the majority rule the neighborhood plays a significant role in terms of the market shares whereas movement (interpreted as seeking for information in other sources) is almost negligible. Exactly the opposite phenomena are observed for models in which unanimity, instead of majority, is needed to convince agents. We also introduce a modification of the unanimity rule, based on the Latane theory of the social influence, and show that on the macroscopic level this modification is indistinguishable from the simple unanimity rule.

"Using conservation tourism as a test case, this study explores the role high-end travel agents play in selling sustainable tourism. It examines a niche marketing activity in that process. The study focuses on agents’ consideration of ethics as they act as information brokers between tourists and operators. Data were collected from interviews with agents and analysed using a deductive content analysis based on six overarching concepts and theories on ethical decision-making. The findings emphasize the implicit influence within conservation tourism of tourism's ethical dimensions, whilst identifying many constraints that prevent a full consideration and/or disclosure of ethical concerns in the sales process. Most importantly, agents made assumptions using a false consensus bias about clients' preferences for service over concerns for the environment, and were not prepared to discuss the more sensitive issues surrounding conservation with their clients. A number of recommendations are proposed regarding the need to unpack conservation information, overcome the false consensus bias, and agents’ reluctance to discuss ethics in the sales process. Finally, the findings have broader implications for the development of sustainable tourism, which ultimately will depend on a dialogue of ethical concerns and values within the tourism supply chain between suppliers, brokers and tourists. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Mossaz A.; Coghlan A.,Tactical,10.1080/09669582.2016.1198358,Conservation; ethical decision-making; marketing; travel agents,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on the role of high-end travel agents in selling sustainable tourism, which involves structured decisions and considerations regarding marketing strategies and client interactions.

"The development of modern economy highlights the role and importance of information factor while making managerial decisions especially in the sphere of marketing activity of any organisation. Under such circumstances the problem of forming effective marketing information systems is becoming crucially important for Russian organisations. Marketing analysis is rather poor in modern Russian economy mainly because the history of Russian market economy is not so long and the analysis does not have enough bases of historical statistics data during the «new era» of functioning of Russian economy. Marketing information systems based on new technologies of processing and synthesising of information flows might improve the situation. The current research is dedicated to solving the following tasks: to classify different kinds of marketing information at the enterprise; to define the marketing information system according to the authors' point of view; to elaborate the methods of assessment of the enterprise information supply and to create a model of effective marketing information system.

"In this article we examine the possibility of using geomarketing as a tool for modeling the spatial location of a bank’s offices serving individuals and legal entities. Geomarketing is a marketing concept of modern production management based on geo-information technologies which involves the use of spatially localized information to support decision-making. This concept is particularly timely for commercial banks which present their services to customers in an extensive network of service offices, because for the majority of banking services the determining factor in the consumer’s choice of bank for a given service will be the convenience of the location of its office. The article describes a sequence of typical steps in geomarketing simulations and makes recommendations for the implementation of each selected stage. Methodical approaches to the implementation of geomarketing modeling for an optimal network of the bank’s service offices are highlighted. Problems in the organization of the network of service offices of the bank which can be solved with the help of geomarketing design are studied. Recommendations are presented for evaluating the capacity of a commercial bank’s office service network depending on their specialization in serving individuals or legal entities. An algorithm is presented for calculating the service office network capacity for individuals together with respective formulas. An approach to evaluating the capacity of the office network servicing legal entities is described. Recommendations are offered for implementing the evaluation of planned location of offices servicing the bank’s clients, as well as for determining the habitats of their preferred location to facilitate the most effective coverage of the local market while taking into account the return on investment in offices. © 2020 Business Informatics.

"Purpose: This study aims to describe South African consumers’ wine risk perception on varietal level with recommendations for Chenin blanc. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory mixed methods approach was followed where qualitative data were used to develop the questionnaire. Quantitative data were collected from 2,051 respondents using an online survey. ANOVA and Fischer least significance difference tests were used to indicate statistical significance. Findings: Significant perceived risks (PRs) associated with Chenin blanc across age and ethnic groups were functional, time and financial risks. Risk-reducing strategies (RRS) in the white wine category were favourite brands and a trusted store, while Sauvignon blanc was also described as an RRS. Recommended Chenin blanc RRS include tastings and events with food. Research limitations/implications: Measurement of PR remains challenging. This research approach can be reproduced and/or adapted to investigate other struggling varietals and/or regions-of-origin. The convenience sample limits generalisability. Practical implications: Segments were identified to develop new markets for Chenin blanc. RRS emphasise the importance of real sensory experience rather than media exposure to build knowledge and familiarity. Originality/value: This study is a pioneering endeavour in terms of using an exploratory mixed methods research approach to investigate and describe risk perception of a specific wine varietal.

"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of purchasing occasion on product value indicators for a selection of Australian and New Zealand branded wines, as evaluated by consumers. Value indicators were defined as conspicuous or inconspicuous. Conspicuous indicators include corporate advertising, such as the vineyard, region or brand, and are considered the same (or equal) for all recipients. Inconspicuous indicators are less visible and may differ from recipient to recipient, such as referrals. Purchasing occasions are either home (personal and private) or restaurant consumption (personal and public) or as a gift (impersonal and public). Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was used to understand the changing importance of value indicators based on differing purchase goals. The snowball sample was comprised of marketing professionals, who are highly educated and likely to be of prime working age (25-55 years). Initial participants were then asked to forward the email invitation to their networks. The majority of the 298 survey respondents were Australian-born and described themselves as Anglo-Saxon. Findings: Conspicuous indicators, such as advertising, are given more consideration for impersonal consumption experiences such as gifts or to drink in public. Less conspicuous, but more trustworthy, indicators, (personal recommendations), are more important for personal consumption experiences. These results offer insight into the indicators of product value that marketers could emphasise in their marketing mixes to target consumers buying with different purchase goals in mind and seek new markets. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited in geographical selection, and the methodology comprised an online survey. The nature of the purchase contexts was deliberately kept broad to highlight the overall impact of value indicators. Originality/value: While there have been some studies centering on wine purchase and consumption in different situations, direct comparisons between contexts are rare. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by comparing consumer behaviour across wine purchase contexts. The value of this paper stems from deepening understanding of the role of context in purchase decision-making and the implications for marketing practitioners and clearly identified opportunities for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dobele A.R.; Greenacre L.; Fry J.,Tactical,10.1108/IJWBR-07-2016-0021,Online survey; Purchase context; Purchase indicators; Seemingly unrelated regression; Value judgements; Wine marketing,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The paper examines the impact of purchasing occasions on product value indicators, providing insights that can inform marketing strategies and decisions related to targeting consumers based on different purchasing contexts.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,The impact of purchase goal on wine purchase decisions,2018

"Today's more “mindful” consumers’ food consumption decisions are changing as they attempt to balance egoistic and altruistic motivations. This study explores the relative importance of these types of motivations in influencing Australian consumers’ attitudes towards, and purchase frequency of, local food. Factors examined include ethical self-identity, environmental consciousness, health consciousness and food safety. Results indicate egoistic motivations may influence local food consumption decisions more strongly than altruistic motivations.

"Purpose – Primarily, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the interaction and direct effects of tie strength between sender and receiver of word of mouth (WOM) and the receiver’s service purchase decision involvement on WOM influence. A secondary aim is to investigate how a distinctive conceptualization of perceived risk, consisting of two types (outcome risk and psychosocial risk), affects service purchase decision involvement. A conceptual model incorporating these constructs and associated hypotheses is developed and tested. Design/methodology/approach – In a survey of actual service consumers, respondents were asked to recall a recent instance where they had received service purchase information via WOM, and relate their responses to this instance. Established scales were used to measure the constructs. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings – Principally, findings demonstrate a strong interaction effect between service purchase decision involvement and tie strength. Also, results highlight the complexity of the perceived risk construct, suggesting that it is appropriately modeled as two types: outcome risk, and psychosocial risk. Research limitations/implications – This research has contributed to the service marketing literature by testing a model that predicts WOM influence. Evidence confirmed that the effect of service purchase decision involvement on WOM influence is moderated by tie strength. Additionally, a conceptualization of two different types of risk associated with purchase decisions was suggested, together with empirical confirmation of their hypothesized antecedent effects on service purchase decision involvement. Findings have special implications for the literatures of persuasion, social and interpersonal influence, as well as consumer behavior in general. Practical implications – To harness the power of WOM, managers should understand who their target audience is and how consumers are related to each other (tie strength) and to the service purchase decision (service purchase decision involvement). Recommendations are made with specific illustrations of how firms can leverage tie strength under conditions of low service purchase decision involvement to enhance WOM influence. Originality/value – The formidable power of WOM wields substantial influence on consumers, particularly within a service (vs goods) purchase context, typically characterized by higher perceived risk and lower search qualities. The significant interaction between tie strength and service purchase decision involvement is a unique contribution to the service WOM literature. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Voyer P.A.; Ranaweera C.,Tactical,10.1108/JSTP-04-2014-0070,Influence; Involvement; Risk; Service purchase decision; Tie strength; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the interaction of word of mouth (WOM) influence with specific variables such as tie strength and service purchase decision involvement, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.

"The purpose of this research is to study consumer attitude towards mobile advertising in Malaysia, and whether this attitude results in the intention to purchase the products or services advertised. This article reports on the results, based on factors such as entertainment, informativeness, irritation and credibility, which the research framework derives from Ducoffe (1996, Advertising value and advertising on the Web, Journal of Advertising Research, 36(5), 21–35) and Mackenzie (1989, An empirical examination of the structural antecedents of attitude toward the ad in an advertising pretesting context, Journal of Marketing, 53(4), 48–65). Attitudes towards behaviours, and subjective norms, based on the research by Ajzen (1991, The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behaviour & Human Decision Processes, 50(2), 179–211), are included in understanding consumer intention. A survey is conducted on 150 respondents, and the partial least squares analysis is used to determine the antecedents of mobile advertising that lead to consumer acceptance of mobile advertising, and the resulting intention to purchase. Results show that the advertising message content has the largest impact on attitude in advertising that is done via mobile phone. Attitudes towards mobile advertising are linked to the intention to purchase the product or services advertised. The main implication of the study shows that marketing managers should focus their marketing communication on mobile advertising, and increasing the attractiveness of this form of advertising, so as to reflect consumers’ intention to purchase. This study opens a new channel of communication for multiple unexamined matters concerning the mobile advertising industry.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of social commerce constructs (SCCs), social support and relationship quality on social commerce intentions, which lead to use behaviour of social networking sites for social commerce. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 343 users of social networking sites in Pakistan. The data analysis was conducted using PLS-SEM. Findings: The results show that SCCs have empowered consumers through the existence of virtual groups, ratings and reviews and recommendations and referrals, thereby having a significant impact on social commerce intentions. The relationship quality with social networking sites, measured through commitment, satisfaction and trust, also proved to be a leading forecaster of social commerce intentions. The impact of social support could not positively influence the relationship quality with the social networking site. However, social support influences the social commerce intentions significantly.

"Purpose: Consumers increasingly depend on the internet as the information source to make their hospitality decisions, which highlights the need for more research in online recommendation. Due to the globalization, culture and its effects on marketing become an increasingly important subject to investigate. Therefore, this paper aims to offer a cross-cultural investigation of consumers’ different trustworthiness and credibility perceptions when facing online recommendations from different information resources. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the source-credibility theory to examine consumers’ responses to online recommendations from two sources. Participants were recruited from two equivalent marketing panels in each culture. A 2 (online recommendation source: in-group vs out-group) by 2 (culture: American vs Chinese) between-subjects quasi-experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results demonstrate that culture moderates consumer responses to the two types of online sources. Chinese consumers, due to their more collectivist nature, exhibit higher levels of purchase intent when the recommendation originates from an in-group rather than from an out-group. Such differences are not observed among the more individualist American consumers. Furthermore, trustworthiness plays an important role in influencing Chinese consumers’ perception of recommendation credibility and the consequent purchase intent. Practical implications: This research provides guidelines to hospitality practitioners when developing their social networking sites and online marketing strategies across different cultures.

"Interest in customer reacquisition has increased as firms embrace the concept of customer relationship management. Using survey and transactional data from defected subscribers of a publishing company, we investigate how defected customers evaluate their propensity to return to the company prior to any win-back offer. We introduce a new variable for relationship marketing, general willingness to return (GWR), and show that it is strongly and positively related to the actual return decision and the duration of the restarted relationship. Combining attribution theory elements with existing win-back explanations, which focus on economic, social, and emotional value perceptions, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the GWR to a former relationship. Importantly, we learn that regardless of whose fault it is, if the reasons for the relationship termination can change or are preventable and the firm can control those changes, then the defected customer has a higher general willingness to return to the former relationship. Also, we show that the duration of time absence before relationship revival moderates the impact of GWR on second relationship duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that satisfaction prior to defection and the length of time absence provide a reasonable basis for distinguishing defected customers who differ in their GWR. By applying our findings, we derive recommendations for firms on how to position marketing communications to recapture defected customers according to their general willingness to return. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",Pick D.; Thomas J.S.; Tillmanns S.; Krafft M.,Tactical,10.1007/s11747-015-0453-6,Consumer attributions; Customer relationship management; Relationship revival,5.0,,10,0,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of defected customers' propensity to return and the implications for marketing communications, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at executing strategies related to customer reacquisition and relationship marketing.",scopus-recommendation,15,70,Customer win-back: the role of attributions and perceptions in customers’ willingness to return,2016

"This article describes how e-marketing is increasingly gaining interest within Islamic businesses. It is important to consider the extent to which it fits comfortably within principle notions of Islam and Sharia law. An Islamic business should ensure that its e-marketing strategy must be devoid of any contentious or exaggerated claims and there must be no excessive risk. As marketing practices include accentuating the benefits and features of products and services, and downplaying the negative attributes which potentially could lead to a consumer making an informed decision based on this unbalanced presentation. Arguably, this presents a form of risk that may be at odds with the fundamental tenets of Islam.

"Purpose: – Word of mouth (WOM) plays an important role for the decision process of customers. This is especially interesting for service-dominant organizations like theaters where quality is more difficult to evaluate. In times of social media, third party recommendations can be given much more quickly, effectively and in greater detail. However, up to now not much has been researched on electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in a performing arts marketing context. The purpose of this paper is to provide some first exploratory insights into this research area. Design/methodology/approach: – To do so, a literature review is conducted to clarify the concept of eWOM and the relevance of recommendations in the performing arts. Then, parts of the results of an online survey on Facebook with 16 German theaters and their fans will be presented. Finally, the implications of the study results for theater marketing are considered and ideas for future research are discussed. Findings: – The study results confirm that recommendations have a high relevance for theatergoers and are very relevant in a social media context. They also show that the trustworthiness of eWOM on social media depends on the familiarity between the message sender and receiver. However, the results are limited with regard to the research design. Therefore, this paper concludes with ideas for further research.

"This research considers how marketers can encourage or “nudge” consumers to transmit word of mouth (WOM), such as referrals or recommendations to friends, in a manner that helps reach, inform, or influence large numbers of consumers quickly, which is an outcome referred to as faster diffusion. Building on studies showing diffusion is faster when higher-connectivity people are involved; the authors propose a mechanism based on network externalities that encourages regular customers to select receivers who have higher levels of social connectivity. Three experiments and a simulation demonstrate the mechanism's efficacy by showing (i) how regular consumers can be encouraged to select higher-connectivity friends as WOM receivers, (ii) why this mechanism works, and (iii) how encouraging this receiver selection behavior can lead to faster diffusion at the macro level. The findings extend the WOM marketing literature by introducing an approach for encouraging transmissions to specific types of consumers that is a viable alternative to directly targeting higher-connectivity consumers in seeded WOM campaigns, which is often practically infeasible. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Stephen A.T.; Lehmann D.R.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.08.003,Diffusion; Field experiments; Incentives; Referrals; Social networks; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on how marketers can encourage consumers to engage in word-of-mouth marketing through specific strategies that target consumer behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-recommendation,15,65,"How word-of-mouth transmission encouragement affects consumers’ transmission decisions, receiver selection, and diffusion speed",2016

Two types of farmers were surveyed: members of dairy cooperatives (DCs) and members of private organisations (POs) representing the two key marketing channels. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, and a binary probit regression model was used to examine the factors influencing farmers' decision regarding the choice of marketing channels. The study revealed that dairy farming experience, the number of years of membership in the milk collecting centres (MCCs), distance to the MCCs, milk price, payment period, access to market information, advisory service, credit service and farm input service had positive influence whereas marketing experience had negative influence on the choice of selling to the DCs.

"Research background: Endeavouring to develop healthy societies is a primary goal in many countries. As smoking is a major problem of public health, lowering the extent of smoking is one of the conditions for developing a healthy society. Based on the research revealing that the pairing of the product with negative stimuli enhances the possibility of negative reaction to the product as negative stimulus transfers it's meaning to the product, tobacco packaging was labelled with negative smoking-related pictures illustrating the danger of smoking. Nevertheless, the extent of smoking is still large in many countries. Hence, the effect of negative smoking-related pictures has been the subject of intense debate within the scientific community. Purpose of the article: The aim of this research is to determine the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. Methods: For the purpose of determining the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking, Implicit Association Test and questionnaire survey were provided. The questionnaire was elaborated based on the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. Findings & Value added: The theoretical analysis substantiated the influence of attitude toward the product on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, people do not always want to reveal their opinion, hence traditional marketing research methods for measuring explicit attitude are not sufficient as they are often not objective. Therefore, neuromarketing research methods complement traditional marketing research methods by providing more objectivity. Consequently, the Implicit Association Test and traditional questionnaire research are applied for the empirical research, revealing the effect of negative smokingrelated pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. The recommendations for the usage of negative smoking-related pictures on purpose to influence attitude toward smoking and consumer purchase behaviour are substantiated. © 2017 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

"Geographic proximity has become increasingly relevant due to the growing number of marketing services that use consumers' geographic locations, thus increasing the importance of gaining insights from this information. In five studies (both field and experimental), the authors analyze the effect of geographic proximity on social influence and demonstrate that not only social proximity but also perceived homophily can trigger social influence. They find that this effect holds under alternative representations of geographic distance and is confirmed for a range of different services and even for physical goods. Furthermore, the authors show that geographic proximity has a relative effect because the social influence of a closer sender is stronger than that of a more distant sender, regardless of the absolute distances. They present managerially relevant conditions under which the influence of geographic proximity not only is comparable to other types of information such as age or gender but also provides sufficient informational value for customers to offset differences among alternatives (e.g., due to higher prices) in trade-off decisions. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Meyners J.; Barrot C.; Becker J.U.; Goldenberg J.,Tactical,10.1509/jm.16.0057,Geographic proximity; Homophily; Online reviews; Recommendations; Social influence,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the effect of geographic proximity on social influence in marketing, providing insights that can be directly applied to marketing strategies and campaigns, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,The role of mere closeness: How Geographic proximity affects social influence,2017

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence, price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Susanty A.; Bakhtiar A.; Jie F.; Muthi M.,Tactical,10.1108/BFJ-10-2016-0462,Dairy industry; Milk; Suppliers; Supply chain management; Trust,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the relationships between various factors such as collaborative communication, trust, and supplier loyalty, which are actionable for managers in dairy cooperatives.

"With the rapid growth of native advertising, there has been an increased interest to address ethical concerns and deception online. To address this concern, we look at the consumer's ethical efficacy toward native ads and we compare native ads (such as in-feed and advertorial) to banner ads. Results confirm that consumers trust native ads more than banner ads. Moreover, we uncover that consumers ethical efficacy (i.e., confidence in ethical decision making) affects their intention to share native ads through eWOM. However, consumer individual differences influence intention to share content online and trust in the native ads. We study the moderating effects of salience, using the fashion context, and its influence on ad trust and willingness to share through eWOM.

"Considering the benefits of the organic production system, it is recognized as one of the main drivers of future economic development. However, the imbalance between demand and supply at the local market level represents one of the serious obstacles that prevents its future growth. Therefore, this article examines the key factors related to the main elements of the offer that have the strongest impact on consumer preferences and acceptance of organic food products. In that sense, organic product, price, distribution channel, and promotion are considered the main elements of the offer and are analyzed in this paper from the consumer preferences perspective. Further, this article provides insight into some of the sensory properties of the offer that are important to consumers. Finally, it gives recommendations for optimization of the offer on the organic food market based on the analysis of the influence of each of those elements (product, price, distribution, and promotion) on consumer acceptance of organic products and making purchasing decisions. The data were collected using a questionnaire, and analyzed using the structural equation model (SEM). The results revealed that price and promotion have the strongest impact on consumer acceptance and buying decisions. Further analysis revealed that attitudes towards organic food products, price/quality ratio, distribution barriers, and modern media as a promotion instrument are the factors that have the most significant impact on consumer perception and attitudes towards the available market offer. These findings can help producers and other decision makers to better understand what creates added value of the organic food products in consumers’ mind and therefore make an offer that is in line with their expectations and preferences, which is recognized as one of the main prerequisites for the acceptance and purchase of organic food products. © 2020 by the authors.",Melovic B.; Cirovic D.; Dudic B.; Vulic T.B.; Gregus M.,Tactical,10.3390/foods9030259,Consumer preferences; Market; Optimization; Organic food; Product acceptance; Sensory properties,5.0,,15,0,MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,"The abstract focuses on analyzing consumer preferences and acceptance of organic food products, which involves structured decisions related to marketing elements such as product, price, distribution, and promotion, making it more aligned with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,The analysis of marketing factors influencing consumers’ preferences and acceptance of organic food products—recommendations for the optimization of the offer in a developing market,2020
"Purpose: The number of studies on the use of choice cues in the purchase decision of a smartphone does not appear to be extensive, given the size and rate of growth of the market. Surprisingly, it appears that no study of this type in the Chinese context has been undertaken. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach: Best–Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings: Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important. Findings due to gender, income and age difference were also analyzed and discussed for orderly decision-making purposes. Practical implications: The ranking of factors showing what choice cues consumers consider most or least important in a particular market helps practitioners to develop appropriate adaptation strategies for the market. The comparison of findings for gender, income and age difference can further help practitioners to devise various alternative marketing strategies for different market segments and identify underserved segments, if any. Originality/value: The BW scaling method, however, appropriate in ranking order of importance, had never been used in ranking choice cues of smartphone purchase. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of studies about ranking of choice cues on smartphone purchases in the Chinese context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Pinto L.; Kaynak E.; Chow C.S.F.; Zhang L.L.,Tactical,10.1108/APJML-01-2018-0004,Best–Worst scaling method; Buying decision process; Chinese context; Product attributes; Ranking of importance; Smartphone,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on identifying and ranking choice cues that influence smartphone purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing strategies aimed at segmenting markets and optimizing product offerings based on consumer preferences.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Ranking of choice cues for smartphones using the Best–Worst scaling method,2019
"Purpose: As organisations are increasing their investment in social media marketing (SMM), evaluation of such techniques is becoming increasingly important. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to knowledge regarding SMM strategy by developing a stage model of SMM evaluation and uncovering the challenges in this process. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with 18 key informants working for specialist SMM agencies. Such informants are a particularly rich source, since they manage social media campaigns for a wide range of clients. An exploratory research was conducted and thematic analysis surfaced the key components of the SMM evaluation process and associated challenges. Findings: The SMM evaluation framework is developed. This framework has the following six stages: setting evaluation objectives, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying metrics, data collection and analysis, report generation and management decision making. Challenges associated with each stage of the framework are identified, and discussed with a view to better understanding decision making associated with social media strategies. Two key challenges are the agency-client relationship and the available social analytics tools. Originality/value: Despite an increasing body of research on social media objectives, KPIs and metrics, no previous study has explored how these components are embedded in a marketing campaign planning process. The paper also offers insights in the factors that make SMM evaluation complex and challenging.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how students in a Malaysian context, as a result of their experience of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) undergraduate teaching and learning experience in the subject of Marketing, perceive the knowledge, skills and competencies required of a practicing marketer and, conversely, what curriculum developers need to do if there is a ""shortfall"". Design/methodology/approach: Based on a total sample of a UG student population from an Accountancy, Finance and Business Faculty, the primarily descriptive, positivist, cross-sectional study used inferential statistics to measure the relationship between the four components of marketing knowledge, skills and competencies (the marketing mix, performance, social and emotional competencies, and responsible decision making). Findings: Quantitative results revealed that all student perceptions of the requirements to be a ""fit for purpose"" marketer were highly correlated with requirements from the literature, subject benchmarks and practice with few exemptions. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on one institution. Moreover, knowledge, skills and competency requirements by students' level of study and practitioner experience may vary by type of HEI, organisation and geographic location.

"Recently, most companies interact more with their customers through the social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter. This has made large amount of textual data freely available on the internet for competitive intelligence analysis, which is helping reposition more and more companies for better profit. In order to carry out competitive intelligence, financial institutions need to take note of and analyse their competitor's social media sites. This paper, therefore, aims to help the banking industry in Nigeria understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge, which will form the foundation for decision-making and internet marketing of such institutions. The study describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyse unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the five largest and leading financial institutions (banks) in Nigeria: Zenith Bank, First Bank, United Bank for Africa, Access Bank and GTBank. Analysing the social media content of these institutions will increase their competitive advantage and also lead to more profit for the banking institutions in question.

"Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this modelbased recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%.

"Purpose: Blogging has become part of a consumer's decision making process when shopping online; however, the understanding of blog recommendation's effect on consumer purchase decision is still vague. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the blog reader's trusting belief in the blogger is significant in relation to the perceived usefulness of the blogger's recommendations; and how the blog reader's perceptions influence his/her attitude and purchasing behavior online. The moderating effect of blogger's reputation on readers' purchasing intentions is also tested. Design/methodology/approach: Based on various theories, a model was proposed in this study. A survey involving 327 blog readers as participants was analyzed in the empirical study to investigate whether the usefulness of bloggers' recommendations and trusting beliefs toward blogger had influence on consumers' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward online shopping. Findings: The results indicated that perceived usefulness of bloggers' recommendations and trust had significant influential effect on blog users' attitude towards and intention to shop online. Moreover, the findings showed that different determinants affected the users of perceived-high-reputation and perceived-low-reputation blogs. Originality/value: The findings suggest bloggers' electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to be a promising marketing strategy for increasing sales. The marketers should provide free trial products and services to the perceived-high-reputation bloggers who, as valued opinion leaders, will influence and prompt others to shop online through a trusting effect.

"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Lambrecht A.; Tucker C.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.11.0503,Construal level theory; Field experiments; Online advertising; Online decision process; Retargeting,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of dynamic retargeted ads versus generic ads in an online advertising context, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to campaign optimization and targeting strategies.",scopus-recommendation,15,65,When does retargeting work?

"We measure the value of promotional activities and referrals by content creators to an online platform of user-generated content. To do so, we develop a modeling approach that explains individual-level choices of visiting the platform, creating, and purchasing content as a function of consumer characteristics and marketing activities, allowing for the possibility of interdependence of decisions within and across users. Empirically, we apply our model to Hewlett-Packard's (HP) print-on-demand service of user-created magazines, named MagCloud. We use two distinct data sets to show the applicability of our approach: an aggregate-level data set from Google Analytics, which is a widely available source of data to managers, and an individual-level data set from HP. Our results compare content creator activities, which include referrals and word-of-mouth efforts, with firm-based actions, such as price promotions and public relations. We show that price promotions have strong effects but are limited to the purchase decisions, whereas content creator referrals and public relations efforts have broader effects that impact all consumer decisions at the platform. We provide recommendations as to the level of a firm's investments when ""free"" promotional activities by content creators exist.

To determine if Twitter use is a beneficial pursuit for marketing educators, we investigated classroom community, pedagogical effectiveness, and learning outcomes based on Twitter use and non-use within a required marketing course. Method/Design and Sample. For comparative purposes, a quasi-experimental design was employed across two semesters of the same undergraduate integrated marketing communications course. One semester (48 students) employed heavy Twitter use by both students and the instructor; the other semester had no Twitter use (36 students). Results. Independent sample t-tests (p <.05) were conducted to test the hypotheses. The course using Twitter had a significantly higher sense of classroom community and perception of pedagogical effectiveness.

Ideally, the incentives would encourage the top tier customers to refer more friends to help AHL further penetrate the market and expand its customer base. Instead, the programme worked the reverse on these customers and referrals from “Apostles” fell. Ray Stevenson had to find out why this was so and think of a way to rectify the problem.

"Customer relationship management is a continually evolving domain that has been particularly affected by social media, which have revolutionised the way businesses and consumers interact. This paper on social CRM builds on a previous model of CRM prior to the growth of social media (Jayachandran etal., 2005). We present a new model for social CRM, including a new construct of customer engagement initiatives and adaptations of other constructs to cater for the impact of social media. An online survey was used to collect data from a population of marketing practitioners and partial least squares analysis was used to test the model. Findings show the importance of an underlying customer relationship orientation; how it impacts on social media technology use and customer engagement initiatives, and also directly on customer relationship performance. A relationship is also shown between engagement and relational information processes, which is viewed as a performance outcome of social CRM.

"The methodological discussion on the calibration of aggregate marketing response models has shifted away from how to obtain usable input for optimization toward how to avoid biases in statistical estimation. The purpose of this article is to remind researchers that such calibration is performed either to support managers in their marketing-mix decisions or to create general knowledge that leads to a better understanding of marketing relationships and thus indirectly supports decisions. Both goals require response models that are optimizable. The models must also be implementable if actual decision support is the objective. Herein, I identify several aspects for which these requirements are not always fulfilled: First, the appropriateness of the chosen functional form of the marketing response models is rarely discussed, although different forms imply quite different optimal solutions. Second, endogeneity is taken into account by structural equations, even though we lack sufficient information on how managers reach their decisions. Third, estimation methods for response models are often evaluated based on goodness-of-fit, while an assessment of their usefulness for subsequent optimization is neglected. Therefore, I provide recommendations for improving the current practice by better specifying the response function and undertaking more simulation-based evaluations of the best estimation method for use in subsequent optimization. With respect to implementation, usability can be facilitated using spreadsheets and heuristics. Moreover, gaining generalizable and replicable knowledge requires better documentation of results, which can be achieved through providing elasticities and as many details as are necessary to replicate a study, thereby enabling faster learning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Albers S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2012.03.001,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the calibration of marketing response models to support managers in making marketing-mix decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets.

"A concept of consumers' behavior in social networks, which is interpreted as a study of the Internet consumers' activity in online associations and comprehension of their decision making in relation to the commodity purchase under the influence of marketing instruments relevant to their advancement in social networks with the aim satisfying the consumers' demands; making repeated purchases and providing loyalty towards a trade mark, has been specified in the article. it is determined that Facebook is widely used by Internet consumers of the European Union, whereas VKontakte (literally «in touch»), Odnoklassniki (literally «Classmates»), Twitter as well as Facebook are the most popular online associations in the Ukrainian Internet segment. The factors that induce Internet consumers to subscribe to brand accounts in social networks are the following: discounts, consumers' favourable attitude towards the brand, their personal interest in a brand, opinions and recommendations of their acquaintances, traditional advertising, media coverage, professional interest, social network posts. It has been found out that 57% of people in the developed countries do not want to contact with brands through social media. In the USA this number grows to 60%, in Great Britain to 61%. A barrier to advancement of brands through social networks in Ukraine is substantial. In our country almost half of all Internet consumers (49%) do not want companies or brands to contact with them. Although 54% of consumers in the world (47% in Ukraine) recognize that social networks are positioned correspondingly in order to get information about food; researches show that brands should care more about their online behavior. To establish long-term relations with consumers online, a new approach has been offered for the enterprise to attract consumers via social networks, to satisfy their needs in social networks and to combine technologies, social platforms and media channels. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2015.",Kapinus L.; Skryhun N.; Semenenko K.,Tactical,,Brand; Internet Consumers' Behavior; Social Media Marketing; Social Networks,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Society Transformation,"The content discusses specific consumer behaviors and marketing strategies in social networks, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Purpose: The research goal of this study was to determine how flow experience and perceived behavioral control (PBC) affect participation behavior in the backpackers' forum. Design/methodology/approach: Subjects were self-selected by placing messages on over five recommendations members in the backpackers' forum. In total, 2,000 invitation messages were mailed to members of the Taiwanese backpackers' forum, of which 435 were returned completed (a return rate of 21.75 percent). Findings: As our analysis, flow experience in a virtual community is positively associated with the behavioral intentions to use the virtual community. Perceived enjoyment in a virtual community is positively associated with the behavioral intentions to use the virtual community, and behavioral intentions to visit a virtual community are positively associated with the member's actual participation in a virtual community. Research limitations/implications: While this study has produced meaningful data for the development of multidimensional measures of factors that influence participation behavior in the Taiwanese backpackers' forum, the validity of an instrument cannot be firmly established on the basis of a single study. All of the data used for tests were collected only from a single backpackers' forum. Practical implications: Our study shows that travel agencies must become technologically astute to keep up with its customers, should be viewing the internet as a vital distribution channel for marketing, and should be linked to other well-known reservation web sites. Social implications: The backpacker community served as a reference group that could significantly influence travelers' beliefs, attitudes, and choices. Originality/value: In the present study we found that a basic understanding of the essence of the backpacker community is a prerequisite for any organization operating a travel-oriented community if they are to be clear about their mission, purpose, and the right direction to take to achieve their goal. That goal will increase the commitment of the members to a virtual community by increasing their helping behavior and active participation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Ku E.C.S.,Tactical,10.1108/10662241111139318,Recommendations; Travel; Virtual worlds,5.0,,20,0,,"The study focuses on understanding behavioral intentions and participation in a virtual community, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into more structured targets, such as user engagement and participation behavior.",scopus-recommendation,15,60,Recommendations from a virtual community as a catalytic agent of travel decisions,2011
"The increasing demand for chicken meat has caused producers to increase their productivity through enhanced production techniques. Further increase in demand for quality meat products has been predicted in the country. This study seeks to investigate factors that influence consumer perception toward chicken meat quality. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 569 consumers at selected shopping malls located in Klang Valley areas. The majority of the respondents perceived quality as an important criterion for buying decisions. The finding revealed that nine factors have influenced consumer perception on meat quality, namely color, size, springiness, chicken aroma, fatty/oily taste, sweetness, visible fat, tenderness, and fibrousness. Among these factors, tenderness was found to be the most important criterion that influenced consumer preference toward chicken meat quality during buying decisions. Good production practices and proper marketing strategies are among recommendations to poultry industry players toward fulfilling consumer demand for good quality chicken meat. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Imran S.N.; Kamarulzaman N.H.; Latif I.A.; Mohd Nawi N.,Tactical,10.1080/10454446.2014.921878,awareness; chicken meat; consumer; perception; quality,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses specific factors influencing consumer perception of chicken meat quality, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"This study investigates tourist behaviour in the Canton of Ticino Switzerland, a geographically dispersed destination, by analysing use patterns of a ‘destination card’ sold by the local destination management organization. Destination cards offer free or highly discounted entry into partner attractions and activities often coupled with free public transport access in the area. Within this context, the study sought to determine if evidence of concentrated behaviour existed, either spatially or by activity. Cluster analysis revealed four discrete market segments. Three of them showed a high degree of spatial concentration in their movements, augmented by some clearly defined activity preferences. The fourth showed no clear pattern, travelling widely throughout the Canton and sampling a range of activities. Hence, the combination of transport and attractions’ entrance appeals to two different user groups, one looking to gain access to attractions and one seeking ease of transport. Discriminant analysis further supported the results with defining the determinant variables of the cluster membership and confirmed that the point of sales has an important role in identifying the consumption of activities and the extension of the area visited. Thus, to conceptualize the decision process in an intra-destination level, the spatial structure of the destination seems to play a greater influence on behaviour than its product structure. The paper illustrates how analysis of destination card data can assist destinations in better understanding their markets and discusses potential research opportunities that can generate real marketing benefits. A number of recommendations especially for destination managers and tourism operators are also identified to enhance the information gathered. Product bundling, regional cooperation and strategic marketing opportunities at sales points are suggested in this context to further incentivize tourist mobility. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Zoltan J.; McKercher B.,Tactical,10.1080/14616688.2014.927523,activity consumption; destination card; discriminant analysis; intra-destination movement patterns; segmentation; Ticino,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study analyzes tourist behavior and provides recommendations for destination managers and tourism operators to enhance marketing strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Social media technologies have greatly facilitated the creation of many types of user-generated information, e.g., product rating information can be used to generate preference-based recommendation. As a decision support tool, a Recommendation Agent (RA) has been widely adopted by many e-commerce websites. The impact of RAs on online shopping has been extensively examined in the IS literature. However, from Marketing and Social Media perspectives, the widely adopted cognitive-affect-conative-action framework of customer loyalty has not been tested in the presence of RAs. Moreover, there has been little research assessing the impact of increasing consumer knowledge about specific product domains on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Based on these important constructs, this study proposes and empirically tests a parsimonious model assessing the moderating effect of consumer product knowledge and online shopping experience on using RA for customer loyalty. The results show that consumer product knowledge relationship between RA's recommendations negatively impacts the recommendation quality and customer satisfaction, however, consumer online shopping experience does not have a significant effect on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The results make a significant contribution to a better understanding of the constructs in our research model and provide evidence useful for the management of websites using RAs for product recommendations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Yoon V.Y.; Hostler R.E.; Guo Z.; Guimaraes T.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2012.12.024,Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction with website; Customer value; Intelligent agents; Online shopping experience; Product knowledge,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of Recommendation Agents (RAs) in e-commerce, focusing on their impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

"The paper analyses the tourist's first stay booking decision and the factors (such as advertising, word-of-mouth, and travel agency recommendation) that most significantly influence it. Three research hypotheses have been considered and a logistic regression model has been specified. The factors ""advertising"" and ""word-of-mouth"" have significant power to explain direct-contact booking. Hence, there is not only a strong association between first stay booking and the Web, but also a very strong association between the booking and the recommendation of someone close to the tourist who has previously stayed at the hotel. This means that these are two important sources of information for inducing the tourist's decision in this respect. The research contributes to both the understanding of the first stay booking decision-making process and the management of the hotel marketing communication media plan. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",Almeida N.M.; Silva J.A.; Mendes J.; do Valle P.O.,Tactical,10.1080/13032917.2012.687690,Advertising; Booking; Marketing communication media; Word-of-mouth,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract focuses on the decision-making process related to tourists' booking decisions and identifies specific factors influencing those decisions, such as advertising and word-of-mouth.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine shelf management practices of grocery retail chains and their category captains (CCs) in the marketing of consumer packaged goods. Design/methodology/approach – This is a qualitative, exploratory study that is set in a duopoly retail environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The study employed 18 in-depth interviews with executives and managers of two umbrella retail organisations and their suppliers/manufacturers. The method of data analysis employed was content analysis. Findings – Despite CC input in merchandising decisions, it is the retail chains that have the final say on shelf matters. There is no risk of strategic loss of power in employing CCs to manage store product categories on behalf of, or in partnership with retailers provided the retail chains closely monitor the activities and decisions/recommendations of the captains. Research limitations/implications – The paper is developed from data obtained from the grocery retail industry of one economy. Future research would need to extend this study to other economies with similar as well as different conditions. Practical implications – The research offers reassurance to grocery retail practitioners who may be contemplating lessening the burden of managing all their store categories by themselves and switching to CC arrangements. The reassurance is that the reported risk associated with loss of power is manageable. Originality/value – The paper has created a typology termed the “category captain arrangement/grocery retail concentration matrix” and specific directions for further research. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Chimhundu R.; Kong E.; Gururajan R.,Tactical,10.1108/APJML-08-2014-0124,Asia Pacific; Category captain; Consumer goods; Grocery retail; Marketing; Power,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses specific practices and decisions related to shelf management and category captains in grocery retail, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Category captain arrangements in grocery retail marketing,2015
"As direct-to-consumer marketing of medical genetic tests grows in popularity, there is an increasing need to better understand the ethical and public policy implications of such products. The complexity of genetic tests raises serious concerns about whether consumers possess the knowledge to make sound decisions about their use. This research examines the effects of educational intervention and feedback on consumers' genetic literacy and calibration-the gap between consumers' actual knowledge and how much they think they know. The authors find that consumers' genetic knowledge was generally low and that people tended to underestimate their knowledge level. Furthermore, consumers' perceived rather than actual knowledge levels drove attitude and purchase intention. Regarding the effect of educational intervention, exposure to an online educational module improved both genetic knowledge and calibration. Offering instant feedback resulted in greater knowledge gain than delayed feedback. The worst learning outcome occurred when feedback was both delayed and brief. On the basis of these findings, the authors offer recommendations for formulating ethically sound public policies in this area. © 2012 American Marketing Association.",Pearson Y.E.; Liu-Thompkins Y.,Tactical,10.1509/jppm.10.066,Direct-to-consumer marketing; Genetic literacy; Genetics education; Knowledge calibration; Marketing ethics,5.0,,20,5,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the effects of educational intervention on consumer genetic literacy and the implications for marketing genetic tests, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,60,Consuming direct-to-consumer genetic tests: The role of genetic literacy and knowledge calibration,2012
"Today's consumers are empowered with online shopper reviews which are mostly written and posted by buyers, customers, users, or visitors at a website. Shopper reviews will become more popular and ubiquitous in e-tailing in the near future. However, the marketing literature is still limited when it comes to knowledge of how shoppers perceive and use online reviews in their purchase decisions. Hence, this study explored shoppers' predispositions toward positive or negative reviews and examined the impact of consumers' attitudes and usage patterns on their perceived helpfulness and credibility of online shopper/peer reviews. One interesting finding from our study of 342 online shoppers was that consumers who would pay greater attention to positive reviews gave reviews more credible and usefulness ratings than their counterparts who would focus on the negative reviews. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Ong B.S.,Tactical,10.1080/10496491.2011.597304,Consumer recommendations; Online shopper reviews; Online word-of-mouth; Perceived credibility; Product reviews; Website promotion,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses consumer attitudes and behaviors regarding online shopper reviews, which relates to how businesses can optimize their marketing strategies and understand consumer engagement.

"This article addresses self-gift giving both from a consumer perspective and from the point of view of brands' promotional messages. Self-gifts may be regarded as personal acquisitions which are distinguished from other purchases by a particular motivation and context - quite literally, gifts to oneself. Our knowledge of this phenomenon from the consumer side remains limited, despite evidence of its importance in understanding consumer decisions. Furthermore, there is no empirical research addressing the extent to which organisations make use of the concept of self-gifts in their marketing activities. This paper addresses these gaps using a two-stage methodology. First, it enhances the understanding of self-gift consumer behaviour (SGCB) by 14 in-depth interviews with consumers. Then, drawing on the self-gift themes which emerged from the interviews, it presents the results of a content analysis of marketing communications for two selected product categories. The combined methodology offers new and rich insights into the theoretical understanding of self-gift consumer behaviour and provides recommendations for practitioners differentiating their marketing communications. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Heath M.T.; Tynan C.; Ennew C.T.,Tactical,10.1080/13527260903236898,Content analysis; Promotional messages; Self-gift consumer behaviour,5.0,,20,0,,"The abstract discusses self-gift giving from both consumer and brand perspectives, focusing on understanding consumer behavior and how organizations can utilize this insight in marketing communications.

"Within the arts and culture sector, bundling is a commonly used strategy that consists in marketing a combination of products in a single package. Drawing from current examples in the arts and culture industry, the study presented in this article examines how different bundling strategies affect consumer decisions and perceptions. An experiment was conducted among a sample of 200 adult consumers where the complementarity of bundle items (complementary vs. noncomplementary) and mode of selection of bundle items (additive vs. subtractive) were jointly manipulated by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Consistent with previous research, the results showed that consumers who construct an arts and culture bundle in a subtractive fashion end up with a greater number of items and a more expensive bundle. However, the impact of mode of selection on the bundle's perceived value was shown to depend on the complementarity of the items. These findings suggest that the recommendation of avoiding bundling noncomplementary products usually put forward in the bundling literature must be evaluated through a consideration of the type of strategy that is used to build the bundle. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Darveau J.; d'Astous A.,Tactical,10.1002/mar.20720,,5.0,,30,0,Wiley-Liss Inc.,"The study focuses on specific bundling strategies within the arts and culture sector and their direct effects on consumer decision-making.

"Case Description: This case asks the students to recommend a decision to a group of individuals on whether or not to pursue purchasing The Shoppes at Riverside, even when the purchase price is minimal ($1). It is based on the actual experiences of one of the authors. The Shoppes at Riverside is a unique business located in a historic building in a downtown area. The store occupies approximately 5,500 square feet of space (leased from a local foundation) and subleases space to dealers selling upscale merchandise including art, antiques, home accessories, and gift items. The store charges a monthly rent to each dealer (based on their booth square footage) along with a 10% commission on sales. The students are given basic information provided by the present owner and are asked to evaluate the information given to project monthly cash flows and then to make a recommendation to the potential purchasers. They are also asked to evaluate and suggest other lines of business that might be added to the present business to increase the profitability of the store. This case is appropriate to use in an Intro to Small Business Class as the size of the business is ideal for any course that emphasizes entrepreneurs or small businesses. This assignment can be completely individually or as a group assignment. Case Synopsis: The primary focus of the case is a purchase decision. The information given to the students to utilize in formulating their decision includes store sales by month for each of the last three years as well as operating expenses. From the information given, the students are asked to construct pro- forma cash flows for the year 2007 by month based on their assumptions regarding sales and occupancy levels. They are also asked to research other product lines the potential buyers could add to the store to complement the present merchandise presently being sold by dealers. Although the store does collect rental income, there is a cap on percentage rents at 10% of sales which in turn limits the total revenues of the store. The students are given some ideas on lines of business to research within the questions of the case. They may have others they would also like to research. A second phase of the case analysis would be to break the case into group assignments and have each group research and prepare presentation on such topics as (1) the various type of advertising options and the related costs applicable to small retail businesses in order to develop and implement a marketing plan; (2) the type of business formation available to small businesses (i.e. Corporation, Sub-S Corporation, Partnership, LLP; (3) additional product lines to add to increase revenues of the business; and (4) the advantages and disadvantages of developing a website and selling ""on-line"" with this type of business. As a result of the individual and group projects, classroom discussions could be held based on the findings of the groups as well as other current issues faced by small businesses.

"Purpose-With the introduction of the mandatory European Union (EU) organic logo for all organic food products in 2010, the European Commission aimed at fostering the internal organic food market. This needs consumers’ knowledge of the logo. According to earlier research consumers’ knowledge of the EU organic logo is low. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to elicit consumers’ attitudes towards organic certification and labelling and to develop recommendations on how to improve consumers’ knowledge of the EU organic logo. Design/methodology/approach-By means of an online survey with 3,000 participants in six European countries, knowledge of the logo and attitudes towards organic farming and European labelling, as well as organic food purchase behaviour and socio-demographic indicators were elicited. Factor and cluster analysis based on several statements on the test persons’ attitudes towards organic farming and corresponding EU legislation were conducted in order to segment consumers. Findings-The results indicate that knowledge of the logo is low. Only about 15 per cent of all respondents knew its meaning. Four clusters of consumers could be identified: “Committed organics”, “Pragmatic organics”, “Organic sceptics” and Organic disinteresteds’. With reference to the EU organic legislation’s aim of promoting the organic market, particularly “Organic sceptics” should be addressed by emphasising the trustworthiness of the organic certification and labelling system.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the impacts of the size and timing of sales compensations, the management stringency of the insurer and the insurance broker's own moral views on product recommendations made by the brokers. Design/methodology/approach – The data used in this research were gathered from life insurance broker companies in Taiwan. Findings – The results showed that the sales compensations, perceived leniency of the insurer's underwriting and claim policy would affect the product recommendations made by the brokers. Practical implications – Insurance brokers are one of the most important marketing channels in the insurance industry. However, using the insurance brokers to sell insurance may result in some ethical problems. For example, some insurance brokers may sell insurance to high-risk customers because the high-risk customers may prefer to buy more insurance and that means more sales compensations can be earned. The findings of this research may have some implications for insurance management and insurance regulation. Originality/value – This study contributes to the understanding of insurance brokers' responses to adverse selection problems (high-risk customers may prefer to buy more insurance) and product recommendation decisions.

"Online social networks (OSN) are technology-enabled relationship tools in which a user creates a profile, connects to other individuals, and shares user-generated content with them. One of the many features OSN offer is the ability to post messages in the form of product and service recommendations. Although word-of-mouth research has examined this type of personal communication to intentionally influence consumer decisions, limited understanding exists regarding when a user acts upon a recommendation received from one of their contacts. In this study, we draw on relationship theories and research on trust to analyze the impact relationship characteristics and behaviors of the OSN contacts have on trust in the recommendation that subsequently leads a user to act on this OSN contact's recommendation. The results of a survey of 116 OSN users showed that closeness, excessive posting behavior, and past recommendation experience have a positive impact on trust and intention to act on the recommendation. One characteristic of the relationships, that is, similarity, however, does not affect recommendation trust in the context of OSN. The findings enhance our understanding of relationships and their defining characteristics in OSN.

"The main purpose of the research is to study the key success factors for obtaining a One Tambon One Product (OTOP) food five-star rating, in terms of the characteristics of the community enterprise: management, marketing, production, product development, financial management and agency support. Data was collected from both the presidents and the customers of community enterprises in Phatthalung and Songkhla provinces whose products were selected as five-star food products of the OTOP project in 2011. In-depth interviews were used to collect data from 13 presidents of community enterprises. For consumers, 260 consumers (a group of 20 customers from each community enterprise) were selected to be the sample, and data was collected by both interview and questionnaire. Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data while means, standard deviation and percentage were used to analyse the quantitative data. In terms of management functions, most of the entrepreneurs carry out all management functions: planning, organizing, leading and controlling. On planning, the majority of the managers do all the planning for the enterprise. On organization, all responsibilities are divided between the staff according to their rates of pay. The president of the community enterprise leads the business. Morale has been built up to motivate the staff, and conflict has been eliminated within the operation. Monitoring the activities of the members, and training given by the organization itself or by a third party, were used as part of the controlling function. In terms of marketing, the majority of entrepreneurs focused on a marketing plan for distribution and promotion. They paid great attention to the quality of the product, and the price was set by considering relevant factors. Customers were attracted by various means, and the products were distributed at a place which was convenient for consumers to access. Sales promotions and advertising were used for the promotion mix. Competitors also sell similar products. In terms of production, the entrepreneurs used local raw materials from local or nearby suppliers under long-term contracts. Products were produced on demand using standard technology along with labour. Product quantity was fixed with the customer order. Most products were certified by the food agency. In order to enhance customer choice, most entrepreneurs have developed new products. In term of finances, most of the entrepreneurs have a financial plan in which the initial finance came from the owner or the president of the group. Working capital was allocated and the account was managed. Dividends were shared between all members, and the businesses have no outstanding debt. In terms of support, most of the enterprises were supported by government agencies, and only one enterprise was supported by a private agency. The main problems of production were the uncertainty of nature, the inadequacy of raw materials, delays in production during high season, the product reaching its expiry date, and a shortage of labour. The results from consumers indicated that the taste and cleanliness of the product were the factors that impact on their buying decision when the purpose of buying was to consume the product oneself. More than fifty per cent of customers bought the products more than twice. The purchasing motivation was the consumption of the product. The level of product satisfaction of the consumers was very high, while the levels of satisfaction with price, place and promotion were high. The recommendations are that the community enterprise should have 1) explicit planning of its operation, 2) a clear organization and allocation of responsibilities, 3) short and long term planning, 4) an emphasis on product development, 5) effective production planning, and 6) systematic accounting.

"This paper aims to explore the opportunities that online marketing has to offer and contribute towards small independent hotels in view of the recent decline in hotel brand loyalty. This decline has been fuelled by consumer trends for ‘getting their money’s worth’ and the ability for the small or medium-sized hospitality establishments to reach consumers via Web Based Marketing Strategies. This has narrowed the competition gap with larger international hotel chains considerably. The paper includes a study which identifies the features of hotel websites that are essential to the building and structure of an effective hotel website. The six key elements identified in this paper are accessibility, information, credibility, e-commerce, customer relationship and immediacy. The reliability and validity of this six-element framework as a reflection of user requirements was ‘derived’ and established using empirical data from a survey. These six elements are established factors in granting online customer satisfaction and gaining customer loyalty. An important or crucial sector covered by this study is the Guest User Interface (GUI) of websites (accessibility). It has proven to be evident that attractive, easy to use or a user friendly interface is vital to keep consumers on the site without navigating them to another site long enough to make decisions. The conclusion of this paper is that independent hotels must leverage this opportunity by establishing a strong Web presence and capitalize on other sideline recommendations which include collaborations with third-party booking sites (such as Hotels.com) and developing informative, feature-rich websites of their own. © Mohamed Nassar, Sherif Hassan Abdou, 2013.",Nassar M.; Abdou S.H.,Tactical,,Branding; Hotels; Replicated model; Websites,5.0,,15,0,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,"The abstract discusses specific strategies and elements that independent hotels can implement to improve their online marketing presence and customer engagement, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Sunk costs, which can cause inconsistencies between consumer behavior and economic theory, have been widely studied in different research areas and among various consumer groups. Nevertheless, the authors found that to date there has been no empirical research examining how sunk costs affect consumer behavior with regard to online shopping in different product types. Therefore, this study used the following 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design to study the effects of sunk costs on consumers' online shopping decisions. The results show that (1) sunk costs have significant effects on consumer online shopping behavior. However, due to the different product characteristics, the impacts were weaker effective when consumers bought search goods than when they purchased experience goods; (2) the sunk costs (Membership fee vs. Deposit) of an initial choice and a new choice had interaction effects on consumer intention to purchase a new product; and (3) the sunk costs and service quality of an initial choice and new choice would affect the level of regret felt with regard to the consumer's initial choice. In addition, some recommendations on market positioning and service quality design are made, which practitioners can refer to when formulating marketing strategies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose: Although there is evidence that adoption of mobile shopping has been slow, the increased functionality offered by smart phones offers significant potential for the development of marketing and retailing through the mobile channel. The purpose of this paper is to add to knowledge on consumer shopping behaviour through mobile devices by exploring attitudes to the use of mobiles in shopping, the use of mobile phones at different stages in the consumer decision-making process, the impact of involvement on the mobile consumer decision-making process and mobile shopping location. Design/methodology/approach: An online panel survey was conducted with a UK panel of nationally representative consumers. The survey collected data in respect of the following products that were ranked on level of involvement on the basis of the importance and effort consumers' associated with their purchase: bread (lowest), washing powder, DVD, footwear, phone and TV (highest). Findings: Use of mobiles for shopping is significant, but remains lower than use of computers in shopping. In general, respondents were more positive regarding their use of computer shopping than they were in relation to their use of a mobile. In using their mobile phone in shopping, respondents value its convenience and accessibility. There is higher use of the mobile phone in the information search and consideration of alternatives phases, than in the purchase transaction. The extent of use of mobile devices in the decision-making process is higher with higher involvement products, in relation to all stages in the decision-making process. The most frequent location for the use of their mobile in shopping is at home, which is consistent with the finding that the highest level of use of mobiles occurs in the information search and consideration of alternatives phases. Recommendations are offered for retailers and for further research.

"Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate consumer reactions to professionals who use decision aids to make recommendations. The authors propose that people react negatively to decision aids only when they are usedin place ofhuman expert judgment. When used in combination with expert judgment, decision aids are not perceived negatively and may even enhance service evaluations. Design/methodology/approach – Three online experiments are presented. Participants indicated their perceptions regarding the recommendation strategy of professionals and their impressions of these professionals using one of three strategies: one based on expertise only, one based on decision aids only and a combination of the two (hybrid approach). Both within and between-subjects designs were used. Findings – Contrary to previous research that has found a negative reaction to professionals who use decision aids, the authors fnd that consumers actually appreciate these professionals, as long as the use of decision aids does not replace expert judgment. The authors also fnd that when people are given the opportunity to compare a pure expert judgment approach with a hybrid approach (decision aid in combination with expert judgment), they prefer the latter. Research limitations/implications – Although fndings should extend to various contexts, this research is limited to the three contexts examined and to the type of use of decision aid described. Practical implications – It has signifcant practical implication,as decision aids have been shown to improve decision accuracy, but previous research had indicated that consumers view these professionals in a negative way. The current research more clearly delineates the situations under which negative reactions are likely to occur and makes recommendations regarding circumstances in which reactions are actually quite positive.

"Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the ""right"" one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Hennig-Thurau T.; Marchand A.; Marx P.,Tactical,10.1509/jm.10.0537,Agents; Group decisions; Hedonic products; Joint consumption; Recommender systems; Social relationship quality,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the implementation and effects of group recommender systems, which are tactical in nature as they interpret strategic goals (improving consumer decision-making) into structured decision-making processes for specific use cases, such as choosing hedonic products.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Can automated group recommender systems help consumers make better choices?,2012
"This study investigates the contribution of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to the sales of music albums. We conducted an empirical investigation of twenty-two music albums for a period of eleven consecutive weeks. eWOM was identified as an uncertainty-reducing element in consumer decision-making. Generally, the research hypotheses were partially supported using a multivariate linear regression model. We also found a stronger correlation between some eWOM channels and sales compared to other channels. eWOM has traditionally been considered an un-structured and ad-hoc source of sentiment. Our results suggest that eWOM generated in social networking when analysed appropriately is a fairly reliable predictor of market success. It is effective as a tacit suggestion, recommendation, or referral element with viral network effects. The intended contribution of this work is in identifying eWOM as a significant information contributor in the digital marketplace.",Sharma R.S.; Morales-Arroyo M.; Pandey T.,Tactical,,Digital economy; E-business uncertainty; Latency window; Music albums; Music distribution; Social media; Word of mouth marketing,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on the role of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in influencing sales, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"There has been no significant research undertaken in the Japanese market on wine knowledge level and its relationship with brand loyalty and preference for specific country-of-origin (COO) wine brands. This exploratory study seeks to investigate these aspects and how wine knowledge is acquired and used in buying decisions. A highly structured, self-administered questionnaire in the Japanese language was used to collect data over a three-week period. Data include consumers from six of the eight major regional divisions across Japan. The sample population was female-weighted with moderate levels of education and medium income. A ten-item objective wine knowledge scale was developed to measure consumers' knowledge levels and to form the basis for segmentation. Japanese wine consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge were shown to use more intrinsic cues than extrinsic cues in their purchase decisions, with the importance attributed to intrinsic cues increasing as objective knowledge increases. The study showed consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge do not use the COO cue more than consumers with lower knowledge. Wine consumers view taste, variety and price as the most important buying cues and are influenced by the recommendations of people around them. This research provided insights into the Japanese wine market and the nature of the Japanese wine consumer. It is recommended that wine exporters focus greater marketing efforts on Japanese women, including greater wine education. This study is of value to academic researchers, wine educators, industry practitioners such as restaurant owners/sommeliers and wine exporters alike, as it provides insights into the direction and extent of COO preferences and hence wine (country) brand loyalty. It has a specific focus on wine knowledge and the educational aspect thereof highlighting how this can be used for the benefit of stakeholders. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Bruwer J.; Buller C.,Tactical,10.1108/10610421211253605,Brand loyalty; Brand preference; Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Japan; Market segmentation; Objective knowledge; Subjective knowledge; Wines,5.0,,15,0,,"The study provides insights into consumer behavior and preferences in the Japanese wine market, suggesting targeted marketing and educational efforts, which are tactical decisions that can be implemented to achieve strategic goals.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Country-of-origin (COO) brand preferences and associated knowledge levels of Japanese wine consumers,2012

"Link structures among items within an E-commerce Web site can be regarded as a potential recommendation that helps new consumers quickly locate relevant products. In this paper, combining a modified version of Googles PageRank method with economic analysis of word of mouth, we investigate whether a products position within a network composed of recommendation links is incrementally informative about its future sales. Based on data from Amazon.com, we document that with consumer word of mouth and other product characteristics controlled, the position of a product within a recommendation network does influence consumers purchase decisions, and models incorporating link structure have a higher incremental predictive power of future sales than models without. In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context. Our results show that compared to general Internet surfing behavior, consumer consumption on Amazon is less random. We conclude that even though the product position within a recommendation network does influence customers purchase behaviors, product sales are still mainly driven by their own product characteristics. © 2012 IEEE.",Hu N.; Tian G.; Liu L.; Liang B.; Gao Y.,Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2010.2064318,Collaborative-filtering cross sale; marketing strategy; online word of mouth (WOM); PageRank; price strategy,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the impact of product positioning within a recommendation network on consumer purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how a change to a US policy about product testimonials affected bloggers and to understand bloggers’ perceptions of the organization-blogger relationship (OBR). Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes a survey (n=173) with closed and open-ended questions, and both quantitative and qualitative data are analyzed. Findings – Bloggers’ decisions to accept compensation for a review may influence how much control they feel they have over the OBR. Qualitative data indicate that even as bloggers seek access to products to review, they prefer to maintain editorial control over the review process. Research limitations/implications – The study extends the transparency literature in public relations and relationship management theory by exploring the relationship between bloggers and public relations professionals through the lens of a disclosure policy. Practical implications – Recommendations are offered for public relations professionals in how to maintain transparent relationships with bloggers. Social implications – Qualitative data reveal concern among bloggers about efforts to persuade them and what they should disclose; this may impact the trust that consumers have in reviews at blogs. Originality/value – The study demonstrates the effects of review behaviors on the OBR and offers an organic explanation of how this relationship evolves.

"Purpose - This chapter presents a framework useful in conducting multicountry marketing and advertising research. For the purpose of illustrating the series of steps involved in conducting such investigations, a six-country study examining global consumer culture positioning (GCCP) is presented. The suggested steps are relevant for the exploration of a wide variety of marketing- and advertising-related topics. Methodology/approach - Steps essential to a well-planned research design are addressed in detail, including: theory identification, stimuli selection, hypotheses formulation, measurement development, country selection, fictitious ad development, survey design, cross-national data equivalence, and hypotheses testing. Particular attention is given to construct specification (in this case for soft-sell and hard-sell advertising appeals) and fictitious ad development. General consumers in six countries responded to the ads. Specific procedures for validating formative constructs and testing their cross-country equivalency are suggested. Findings - The chapter provides practical recommendations for conducting cross-cultural research. These recommendations are likely to prove useful to both researchers conducting multicountry investigations, and to instructors teaching graduate-level courses in international marketing and advertising research. Originality/value of paper - Multicountry research requires a series of challenging decisions.

"Indecision is not the hallmark of a great manager, but what do we know about when and why managers avoid or postpone decisions? The purpose of this paper is to discuss the limited research on indecision. This article reviews research from judgment and decision making, psychology, management, and marketing literatures to assemble what we already know about indecision. The review spans situational and personal determinants of indecision, highlighting what we know about when and why people experience indecision as well as who is predictably indecisive. Decisions are avoided when people are asked to justify them, when options are similar in attractiveness, and when there are a large number of options to consider. Indecision may sometimes be a result of systematic biases (i.e. omission bias and status quo bias), and indecisive people may be more prone to confirmation bias. Finally, indecisiveness is related to numerous other individual differences, many of which are negative. Specific recommendations for managers include evaluating options separately rather than comparing options, structuring incentive systems to reward decisive action, and explicitly considering the risk of lost opportunity when deciding whether to put off making a decision. The literature reviewed in this paper spans diverse disciplines and perspectives. This paper provides a starting point for managers and researchers interested in understanding indecision: when and why it occurs, who is likely to be most indecisive, and what we might do to counter indecision. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Brooks M.E.,Tactical,10.1108/00251741111130788,Decision making; Leadership; Managers,5.0,,20,5,,"The abstract discusses indecision in management and provides recommendations for decision-making, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable steps.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the use of online recommendation systems on e-commerce sites is which becoming more common as marketers recognize their potential to improve their own operations as well as consumers' shopping experiences. Since some consumers question the credibility of these systems, this study compares responses to such systems (classified based on their source into seller and third party systems) with responses to recommendations coming directly from other consumers. The latter may also be better suited for consumers today since many of them utilize direct information from social media on a daily basis. Past research indicates that reactions to such recommendations may depend on the types of goods they describe and therefore this study also tests whether consumer responses vary with types of goods. The study examines consumer reactions to recommendations designed for search, experience, and credence goods. Finally, this study also explores the most desired features of recommendations to help marketers come up with the most effective recommendations that help facilitate purchasing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The study surveys a convenience sample of 202 undergraduate students to test these objectives. It was a 3 (product types) by 3 (recommendation types) factorial design with multiple dependent variables and three covariates. Findings: The study reveals that, irrespective of the product type, consumers react differently to the three types of recommendations that are tested. This study shows that consumers have the most positive attitudes and most frequently utilize recommendations coming directly from other consumer. This suggests that more attention should be directed to these recommendations in marketing theory and practice. Consumers also hold more positive attitudes towards third-party recommendation systems than recommendation systems coming from the seller. They also have more positive reactions toward recommendations designed for search and experience goods rather than credence products. Finally, the study also examines the usefulness of different characteristics of these recommendations to help online managers develop most effective recommendations online and finds that it varies with different types of recommendations and products for which recommendations are used. Originality/value: In addition to the recommendation systems that have been explored in the past (seller and third party systems), the study examines reactions to recommendations coming directly from other consumers, as these recommendations may be better suited for today's audiences. The study shows which recommendation type is best received and most frequently used online. It also tests reactions to recommendations designed for different types of goods. This study includes credence goods, in addition to search and experience products, since consumer reactions to recommendations designed for credence goods have not been yet explored in the past research. It also found that recommendations are better received for goods with a higher number of search features. Finally, the study explores the specific features of different recommendation types and based on the findings proposes how these online recommendations should be structured to be most effective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Lepkowska-White E.,Tactical,10.1108/JRIM-07-2012-0027,Advertising; Internet advertising; Internet marketing; Marketing communication; Online shopping; Young consumers,10.0,,20,0,,"The study focuses on the comparison of different types of online recommendation systems and consumer reactions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, specifically in campaign optimization and consumer engagement strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,60,Are they listening?

"Managers are eager to know whether they should use gender-specific strategies to communicate with male and female consumers differently to recommendation services in Internet-based selling, as both groups are worthwhile and profitable to target. This issue has been overlooked in the literature, despite its importance and the fact that recommendations have become a major online advertising tactic in recent years. This study is diverse from existing studies in three ways: testing recommendation agent acceptance in the information context, revealing gender effects and applying a new lens of cognition-conation. By proposing a theoretical model based on the advertising hierarchy of effects model, this study investigated consumers' elaboration processes towards recommendation agent advices. Based on 432 members randomly selected from a database of a well-known Internet-based sellers, the study finds that women consider perceived usefulness of recommendation agent advices to a greater extent than men while making decisions about the usefulness of recommendations. Further, consumers' perceived usefulness is more strongly influenced by their perceived shopping task uncertainty than by involvement, while more-involved consumers have lower levels of perceive shopping task uncertainty. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Tne purpose of this paper is to examine the nine-buying decision-making process of U.S. Generation Y purchasers, when they select European wines. This is one of few empirical studies of U.S. Generation Ywine consumers and their nine purchasing decisions. Using the Howard Model of Consumer Decision Making, the researchers analyzed the significant factors Generation Y purchasers use as they make decisions about wine purchases. Generation Y respondents across the United States who were of legal drinking age were surveyed. In total 713 usable surveys were obtained. Tne researchers found that when Generation Y purchasers consider European Mines, the variables of consumer experience and brand familiarity are significant to the decision process. In addition, the consumer search process helps to build brand familiarity. In turn, brand familiarity improves the consumer attitude which contributes to the intent to purchase wine. Tne results provide valuable information about Generation Y Mine purchasers and it is to these individuals the global wine industry is looking for market growth. European wineries and their associations can use this information to improve their promotional activities and better educate Generation Ypurchasers about their products as they develop marketing programs and positioning strategies Mithin the U.S. Wineries can also target other upon whom Generation Y purchasers rely for recommendations.

"If marketers wish to communicate the positive characteristics of purchasing the private hospital experience, the marketers need to be able to identify which of the participants in the purchasing process is acting in the role of decision maker. Research was undertaken of doctors in the rural setting. Potential respondents were selected from Orange to Broken Hill; from Coonabarabran to Young. Two private hospitals are known to be located within this region - one in Orange and one in Dubbo. In most cases, patients in the rural setting are having the final say as to which hospital to attend. They are filling the role of decision maker. The factors that potential patients are considering in their decision include the services provided by the hospital - specifically factors relating to accommodation, services and cost. These observations are those as interpreted by the doctors who see these patients. Based on the findings of the survey a number of recommendations have been made: (1) Any marketing communication by hospitals should target primarily patients and then doctors. (2) Further research should be undertaken to attempt to accurately determine what characteristics are considered when patients and doctors refer to hospital services. (3) Research should be undertaken to determine the identity of all parties involved in the purchasing decision process.

"Improving marketing decision making requires a better understanding of the factors that influence how managers interpret and respond to a market situation. Building on extant literature, the authors develop a model that delineates antecedents of and responses to the interpretation of a market situation. Using case-scenario methodology, the authors test the model in the context of a marketing decision (annual advertising and promotion budget recommendation) with data collected from a nationwide sample of hospital marketing executives. The results of the partial least squares analysis show that (1) cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use affect the extent to which managers perceive a given market situation as one in which they can control the outcomes of their decision; (2) the more managers perceive a situation as controllable, the more they appraise that situation as an opportunity; and (3) the more managers appraise a situation as an opportunity, the greater is the magnitude of their response.",White J.C.; Varadarajan P.R.; Dacin P.A.,Tactical,10.1509/jmkg.67.3.63.18654,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract focuses on understanding and improving marketing decision-making processes, specifically regarding how managers interpret market situations and make recommendations for advertising and promotion budgets, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,"Market situation interpretation and response: The role of cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use",2003
"With the growing competition and complexity of marketing information,interpersonal communication is becoming increasingly important to marketers and consumers (mavens) who can act as disseminators of marketing communications and play an important role. Previous research, which has found that mavens are more likely to be female, has ignored the way in which these consumer communicators make decisions and process information. As male product markets grow and gender roles in shopping become blurred, identifying male mavens could be a useful promotional tool. Sixty male and 78 female market mavens were identified from a survey of 455 German consumers, which differed only marginally in terms of age and education. The prime decision-making traits of male mavens differed from females and were related to brand consciousness, shopping avoidance/satisficing, impulsiveness, speedy fashion seeking, perfectionism, price–value consciousness, confused by overchoice and quality brand loyal. Implications and recommendations for marketers targeting male product markets in Germany are discussed. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Wiedmann K.-P.; Walsh G.; Mitchell V.-W.,Tactical,10.1080/13527260127413,Gender Differences In Decision Making; Male Market Mavens; Word-OF-MOUTH Communication,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the identification of male and female market mavens and their decision-making traits, which can be utilized as a tactical approach for marketers targeting specific demographics in male product markets.

"Despite growing concerns about the quality and accuracy of Internet-based prescription drug information, there has been very little empirical research on consumers' perceptions of the trustworthiness of on-line drug information. In this article, we report on a study modeled after that of Menon, Deshpande, Perri, and Zinkhan (2002) in Health Marketing Quarterly that reexamines how key demographic, predispositional, and media factors are associated with consumer trust in on-line prescription drug information and the impact of trust in on-line drug information on ad-promoted behavior following exposure to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. Four major findings are reported: (1) on-line drug information is not highly trusted; (2) trust in on-line drug information is not differentially affected by consumer demographic or predispositional characteristics; (3) trust in the traditional media of DTC advertising is predictive of trust in on-line drug information; and (4) trust in on-line drug information is associated directly with specific types of ad-promoted behavior following exposure to DTC advertising.

"Far too often marketing instruments are used in research without sufficient evidence of their reliability and validity. As a result conclusions are drawn, recommendations offered and managerial decisions made, based on empirical results that are often contradicted by follow-up studies, or are simply false. Correct measurement using valid and reliable scales is not just a 'nice to have' in marketing research - it is crucial.

"Electronic commerce (EC) is an important issue both for research and in the real business world. In addition, the Internet is a new and rapidly growing marketing channel for companies developing B2B (Business to Business) or B2C (Business to Customers) electronic commerce. To obtain rewards from EC, dot-com companies should develop their marketing performance effectively to attract customers' attention toward purchasing goods and to provide satisfying service for customers on the Internet. But not all the dot-com companies are successful, many factors will affect the enterprise operation. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to establish a multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) framework for assessing and evaluating the marketing performance of Internet bookstore companies in Taiwan. Based on the hierarchical structure, a mixed MADM method with non-additive and additive fuzzy measurement is used to show the relative importance of quality attributes. Seven real cases are then used as illustrative the alternatives to demonstrate the synthesis decisions under the application of a mixed mode of both MADM methods.

"Managers in the travel industry are keen to know what influences customer decision-making and how customers make their decisions. Travel motivation reflects one's needs and wants and can be viewed as a critical variable in relation to their purchase decisions. Travel motives for joining group travel may be different from those of free independent travelers. This study examined travel motives as well as travel decision-making of Taiwanese travellers with a group package tour abroad. The qualitative approach - participant observation first and telephone interviews with tour participants later - was conducted for data collection. It was found that socio-psychological needs were an important motivation for travel, and socio-economic considerations were regarded as a crucial motivation for travel decision-making. Furthermore, their decision-makings are also strongly influenced by their social relationships - friends/relatives' recommendations. The results also revealed that Taiwanese travelers' travel motivations are considerably related to the price paid. The 'push factor' appeared to have much more impact than the 'pull factor' for impelling Taiwanese travelers in the pursuit of a holiday. Since the source of information for taking a vacation plays an important role for decision-making, this research suggested that the travel agency should put more efforts on nurturing a positive corporate image in order to gain consumers' trust.

"Many firms use decision tools called “automatic recommendation systems” that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark models.

"Drawing on data derived from Motoring Which assessments, the study investigates the role of vehicle security in the decision of people to recommend the purchase of a particular car model to a friend. This is important because, were security to be shown to be salient in purchaser decision making, it would be a factor in incentivising manufacturers and retailers to incorporate and stress car security in marketing. Crucially for purchasing decisions, security was observed to contribute to the willingness of people to recommend the purchase of a particular car model in 2007. This was not significantly so in 2008, although the association was in the same direction. The results are interpreted as modestly encouraging for the importance of security in purchaser decision making. Research on the role of vehicle crime in diminishing brand loyalty is advocated.

"It is evident that there has been increase in integration of global economies as trade barriers were lifted in 2005 resulting in free trade. After agriculture, marketing of hand-produced, cultural products constitutes the second most important source of income in less developed countries of the world. The objectives of this study were to examine US consumers’ perceptions of garments that were culturally inspired by a specific sending culture to better understand the following: (1) perceptions of garment familiarity and garment complexity; (2) the relationship between perceived familiarity and garment adoption/acceptance; (3) the relationship between perceived familiarity and garment adoption/acceptance; (4) acceptance for garments culturally inspired by consumers’ cultural setting or geographic location; (5) acceptance for garments culturally inspired among the different age groups ; and (6) delineation of US consumers’ cultural creativity. To accomplish this endeavor an instrument, developed for measuring consumers’ responses to design characteristics, was tested on US female consumers from five areas of the country and in two age categories. The instrument developed integrated visual stimuli of garments with Likert-type scales and provided consumer data for conducting basic research. Garment attributes included three styles, two color ways, and two fabric print (3 x 2 x 2) =12 garments. The analyses were exploratory in that concepts and relationships were evaluated in a non-causal approach to provide a basis for further research. Generalizatibility was addressed through analysis of multiple consumer groups; however the fashion aspects of the stimuli prevent broad-spectrum application. This study focuses on garments that are culturally inspired by Indonesia as the sending culture. Indonesia is a country with strong textile dyeing and printing traditions. Indonesia is open to westernized silhouettes and it is also an important global source for textiles and clothing production. The Indonesian textile and clothing industry is vertically integrated, encompassing almost every stage of production and contributes significantly to the country’s economy. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation theory provides a foundation for examining issues that inhibit or encourage the adoption of ideas, products, or technologies as they are introduced to individuals or groups of people. Within Roger’s model is a five stage innovation-decision process. This research is concerned with the persuasion stage where the individual forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation. The persuasion stage provided a foundation for examining relationships between familiarity, complexity, and acceptance of Indonesian inspired garments. The two persuasion characteristics of interest were compatibility and complexity of Indonesian inspired products for US consumers. Compatibility reflects how well an innovation is perceived to match existing social norms, needs, and expectations. Complexity concerns how difficult the innovation is perceived as to understand. Diffusion of Innovation is a generic adoption model for innovative ideas and products and was therefore somewhat restrictive for applications to fashion product adoption. Sproles’ Fashion Adoption Theory was thus also employed to understand the concepts of familiarity, complexity and acceptance in the context of women’s apparel attitudes of garment color, fabric print, and style. Also examined in this research were the differences in US consumer responses based on geographic location, age, and cultural creativity. Social influences, socioeconomic characteristics and behavioral norms fluctuate across the North American continent. Subnations are said to exist that define eight differing regions of the US and hold distinguishable characteristics. This research examined the following five subnations and their general US region: Breadbasket (middle), Dixie (southeast), Foundry (northeast), Ecotopia (northwest), and MexAmerica (southwest). In addition to geographic location, two age groups of US female consumers were examined: 19 to 25 years of age and 35 to 55 years of age. Additionally, consumers’ level of cultural creativity was measured. In the US the categories of Moderns and Traditionals are more readily recognized consumer groups than the Cultural Creative group. Cultural Creative, are distinguished by values such as engaged action, altruism, self-actualization, spirituality and ecological sustainability. Variation in Cultural Creative qualities and levels were expected to contribute a greater understanding of product acceptance. Pearson correlation coefficients, univariate analysis of variance with least significance difference post hoc analysis, and forward multiple regressions were run to address the research objectives. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered to the manufacturers of Indonesian inspired garments. To successfully cross market their products to countries like US, manufacturers can retain the color ways culturally inspired by Indonesia as the participants found them to be familiar and highly acceptable.Recommendations for fabric print and styles would suggest lower levels of cultural inspiration for US consumer acceptance. Retailers and manufacturers would also be wise to market their products with strategies and priorities based on the climatic and demographic characteristics of the nine sub-nations, and to consider age categories particularly women between the ages of 35-55 years. It is clear the textile and apparel industry in Indonesia has a number of strengths that have enabled the country to expand its share of international markets. The US importation numbers largely reflect production of US designed apparel with an absence of Indonesian cultural traditions. The potential for designing and marketing Indonesian inspired garments will be enhanced through dissemination of research-based information regarding US female consumer preferences. © 2010 KAMS.

"Purpose The purpose of this research is to show how relationship marketing has recognized the importance of building long-term relationships in increasing firms' profitability and guaranteeing their future viability. Owing to the damaging effects that customer switching behavior could have on the development of successful relationships, understanding customers' switching decisions can represent a key step in the process of establishing, developing and maintaining successful relational exchanges. The current study aims to contribute in this direction by introducing the heterogeneity of customers in their relationship characteristics depth, length and breadth into the analysis of customers' propensity to switch service providers. Design-methodology-approach The data set used to carry out this study has been obtained from a panel survey Home Online of technology users in the United Kingdom, and the proposed hypotheses are tested on the fixed-line telephone sector using logistic regression. This technique associates the relationship characteristics with the probability that a switch in suppliers will take place. Findings The results obtained show that the length, depth and breadth of relationships help to determine customers' propensity to switch fixed-telephone suppliers. Customers who maintain a long-lasting relationship with the firm length, use the service more depth, and invest in complementary services breadth will be less predisposed to switch. Practical implications With regard to recommendations for practitioners, the paper highlights the need for firms to renew both acquisition and retention strategies in order to take individual customer information into account. This should help them to identify and retain the most valuable customers and to optimally allocate marketing resources from switching-prone to non-switching-prone customers. Originality-value The main contribution of the paper is to consider relationship characteristics in the analysis of customer switching behavior. This research shows that the heterogeneity observed in the depth, length and breadth of customer-firm relationships explains the differences in the propensity to switch service providers. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Pablo Maicas Lopez J.; Polo Redondo Y.; Sese Olivan F.J.,Tactical,10.1108/09604520610711909,Customer relations; Relationship marketing; Servicing; Suppliers,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses analyzing customer switching behavior and relationship characteristics to inform marketing strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,The impact of customer relationship characteristics on customer switching behavior: Differences between switchers and stayers,2006
"Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aids for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives X attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making. In particular, we focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality and the efficiency of purchase decisions - shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort. This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.",Häubl G.; Trifts V.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.19.1.4.15178,Consideration sets; Consumer behavior; Decision aids; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information processing; Information search; Online shopping; Recommendation agents,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the implementation of interactive decision aids that assist consumers in their purchase decision-making process in online shopping environments.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the referral patterns of local residents who are frequently requested by visitors to the community to provide information and/or direct venue referrals for travel-related services. Also investigated, were the factors influencing the selection of a specific venue being referred. It is posited that visitors delay many travel decisions until they arrive at a destination and extensively utilize local ""experts"" in their decision strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The current study expands upon previous research on visitor decision strategies for travel-related services once that are at a destination by examining the referral activity of 180 residents in the metro-Orlando area, a destination that attracts more than 47 millions visitors each year. A standardized questionnaire was utilized to collect data in two distinct areas of the destination, a central tourism corridor and a bedroom community. Findings - In general, at-destination recommendations from locals were found to be highly sought by visitors, regardless of the occupation of the perceived local expert. In addition, although the weekly frequency of requests to a local expert was typically lower in the bedroom community in contrast to the tourism corridor, they still existed in significant enough numbers such that they should capture the attention of enterprises providing such services. At the least, a partial alignment of an enterprise's promotional strategies and tactics to reach targeted visitor segments through ""locals"" becomes obvious. Overall, notable recommendation patterns were not uniform across type of service enterprise, and were highly evident for food and beverage and entertainment facilities, while recommendations for lodging facilities were found to be limited in this study. It was also determined that local residents were most influenced by organic factors compared to induced factors. Research limitations/implications - The results suggest that hospitality businesses should focus a portion of their marketing strategies and tactics towards the community in order to attain/drive positive word-of-mouth referrals. This implication is particularly relevant for restaurants and shopping venues. Finally, it is suggested that the most effective way for businesses to reach local residents is through direct contact and communication, rather than traditional advertising channels. Originality/value - The paper has both theoretical and practical value, and provides further confirmation that tourists delay/make many decisions post-arrival and that locals play an important role in travel-decision process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Walls A.; Shani A.; Rompf P.D.,Tactical,10.1108/09596110810892218,Communities; Decision making; Information exchange; Tourism; Travel; United States of America,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses specific marketing strategies and tactics for hospitality businesses to improve word-of-mouth referrals from local residents.

"Purpose – Health is becoming an increasingly important issue in the UK as well as the rest of Europe. Emphasis on the importance of healthy eating is ongoing for many reasons, including the growing concern about childhood obesity resulting in the ban of advertising of unhealthy foods to children in the UK in April 2007. However, although legislation has been placed upon the advertising of unhealthy food products, no such restrictions have been placed on the packaging of children's foods despite the influence of packaging on consumer buyer decisions. This paper aims to investigate the effect of packaging on children's product preferences and its ability to influence parents' buyer decision in-store. Design/methodology/approach – The study was approached from the parents' rather than the children's perspective. A quantitative approach was adopted in data collection, using a 28 item Likert scaled questionnaire administered to 150 parents, with over 95 percent response rate. Findings – The study shows that packaging does affect the product preferences of children. Also, children are particularly interested in influencing the purchase of unhealthy foods. However, parents within the study claimed that they did not succumb to their children's requests for the purchase of unhealthy food, which contradicts evidence from previous findings. Research limitations/implications – The claim by parents that they did not succumb to their children's requests for unhealthy food contradicts findings from previous research. This therefore leads to a recommendation for further studies as social desirability bias may have influenced the outcomes of the findings. Practical implications – Findings from this study can be applied within the retail and service marketing sector to provide the practitioner with information relevant to decision making on children's influence on parents buyer behavior in-store. Outcomes of the study are also important when considering the future of children's food marketing and tackling the issue of childhood obesity. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates that there is a relationship between packaging and children product preferences and children's influence on parents' buyer decision in-store. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Ogba I.E.; Johnson R.,Tactical,10.1108/17473611011026037,Children (age groups); Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Food packaging; Parents; United Kingdom,5.0,,15,0,,"The study explores how packaging influences children's product preferences and parents' purchasing decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at optimizing product presentation and marketing strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,How packaging affects the product preferences of children and the buyer behaviour of their parents in the food industry,2010
"Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case is the pricing of consumer goods in International Markets. Secondary issues include price discrimination by small firms in foreign markets; product differentiation in international markets; branding and price discrimination. This case has a difficulty level of 3-4 and is targeted at business students in a first course in international business or international marketing. The case can be used either as a functional case on pricing in the international environment, or as a study in exporting. One hour of class time should be sufficient to handle the case discussion and students should budget 2-3 hours of time for case preparation. Case Synopsis: The PURAC Enviro-Filter Company is a small manufacturer of air filters located in southern Florida, USA. Diana Page, the firm's marketing manager is in the process of determining her target price for the upcoming year for their most profitable product, the F-18 filter. Just as she was finalizing her recommendation, one of her salespeople approached her with the possibility of entering into a contract for a distributor branded sale to Russia. This would be a new market for her company. The price offered by the Russian mass merchandiser is much lower than that charged for branded PURAC filters in the domestic market. This new market opportunity complicates Diana's decision process. She must decide at what price to offer her goods for sale at home, and consider the relative advantages of the new offer presented by the foreign market proposal. She must decide the probably effect of these additional sales on the firm's profitability and what conditions to negotiate with the Russian company if PURAC decides to accept their offer. © 2009 by the DreamCatchers Group.",Sjolander R.; Eppright D.,Tactical,,,5.0,,15,0,,"The case focuses on the pricing strategy for a specific product (the F-18 filter) in an international market context, which involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable pricing targets and decisions regarding market entry.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Purac Enviro-Filter Company,2009

"It has been widely recognized that marketing's interaction with other functional departments (e.g., R&D) has significant impact on new product success. However, little research addresses how marketing actually behaves in the process of new product development (NPD). Drawing upon marketing, product innovation, and organizational buying literatures, this study contributes to the literature by delineating the types of influence tactics adopted by marketing and investigating how the use of these tactics affects marketing's influence on NPD decisions. Data on 128 new product projects from 114 high technology firms in China were collected from R&D perspective via on-site interviews. The findings indicate that, from the R&D's perspective, both marketing and R&D seem to have equivalent influence on new product decisions. In terms of usage frequency, the most frequently used influence tactics by marketing are persistent pressure, information exchange, and recommendation (i.e., use of rational logic). Coalition formation (e.g., seeking the support of peers) and upward appeal (i.e., seeking support from superiors) tactics are moderately used. The less frequently used tactics are legalistic plea (i.e., use of rules and regulations) and request. Regarding the effectiveness of influence tactics, the results indicate that persistent pressure, information exchange, and coalition formation lead to higher marketing influence in NPD decisions. However, the use of an upward appeal tactic leads to lower marketing influence. Recommendation, legalistic plea and request tactics are unrelated to marketing's influence. Our results also show that the efficacy of marketing's influence tactics is contingent upon the degree of functional interdependence in the NPD stages and the degree of interdepartmental conflict. Information exchange and coalition formation tactics are more effective at the initiation stage of the NPD process whereas legalistic plea and persistent pressure are more effective at the implementation stage. We further find that legalistic plea is more effective but coalition tactic is less effective when the degree of interdepartmental conflict is higher. Findings of this study provide managers responsible for ensuring market-oriented NPD with a better understanding of how the influence of marketing in the NPD process may be enhanced. Given our focus on Chinese firms, they also suggest that managers need to be sensitive to the cultural context of marketing influence.",Atuahene-Gima K.; Li H.,Tactical,10.1016/S0737-6782(00)00059-X,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses specific influence tactics used by marketing in the new product development process, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Marketing's influence tactics in new product development: A study of high technology firms in China,2000
"Risk relief services (RRSs), as complementary to online trust promoting services, are becoming versatile options for risk reduction in online consumer-to-consumer auctions. In this paper, we identify factors that affect the behavior of buyers in an online auction market who had to either adopt or not adopt online escrow services (OES). An experimental C2C auction system with embedded decision support features was used to collect data. Results show that market factors, such as fraud rate, product price, and seller's reputation are important in determining buyers' OES adoption. This study also finds that sellers' reputation has a significant effect on buyer's risk perception, which influences his OES adoption decision. Furthermore, the buyers' OES adoption decisions were found to be congruent with the implied recommendations that were based on expected utility calculations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumerproduct matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individuallevel diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences. © 2009 INFORMS.",Fleder D.; Hosanagar K.,Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.1080.0974,Advertising and media; Application contexts/sectors; Electronic commerce; It impacts on industry and market structure; It policy and management; Marketing,5.0,,15,0,,"The paper discusses the effects of recommender systems on sales diversity, which relates to specific marketing strategies and decisions.

"Purpose – In this paper the competitive landscape of financial institutions is shifting and internet banking is no longer a competitive advantage but a competitive necessity for banks. However, a limited number of empirical studies have been published in the marketing literature about electronic banking. This paper seeks to examine consumers' choices between electronic banking and non-electronic banking in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows that the data for this analysis were obtained through a mail survey sent to 1,960 households in New Zealand. The decision to use electronic banking is hypothesised to be a function of service quality dimensions, perceived risk factors, user input factors, price factors, service product characteristics, individual factors and demographic variables such as age, gender, marital status, income, etc. Logistic regression is used to analyse the data. The discrete dependent variable measures whether an individual is an electronic banking or non-electronic banking user. Findings – The findings in the paper show that the output from the logistic regression indicates that the service quality, perceived risk factors, user input factors, employment, and education are the dominant variables that influence consumers' choice of electronic banking and non-electronic banking channels. Practical implications – This paper provides an improved understanding of consumers' choice between electronic and non-electronic banking. This paper also identifies new relationships, and provides findings that further support, confirm, or contradict previous studies. In addition, it provides insights into the links between electronic banking and consumer decision making, to help provide strategies, recommendations and guidelines for the banking industry.

"A global industry of festivals and events has evolved and developed rapidly since the early 1900s. This phenomenal growth, coupled with increased consumer awareness and choice, requires sustained development and growth in the future. Music festivals are unique events that attract audiences for a variety of reasons; however, while music-based events are an extremely popular form of entertainment, research exploring the motivations of music festival audiences is sparse, especially from a UK perspective. Crompton and McKay contend that event managers should strive to better understand the motives of festival attendance in order to design better products and services for them and because motives are a precursor of satisfaction and a factor in decision making, this in turn can lead to greater attendance. This study critically compares the visitor motivations for attending two UK-based music festivals to challenge and ultimately support existing ideas developed from similar research overseas. The article establishes some of the first research into this area within the UK and challenges common assumptions from those in industry. A range of secondary research was considered and a review of existing literature on the subject was undertaken. Although the sample size was relatively small, the results showed that socializing with friends and family was a primary motive. Most importantly, the article supported the notion that multiple motivations come into play and it suggests that it is risky for festival managers to rely solely on the theme of the event itself. It is equally important to create a fun and festive atmosphere that offers ample opportunity to socialize and have new and nonmusical experiences. Several recommendations were made for existing and future managers including focusing on realigning marketing and service strategies. Recommendations were also made for future research in terms of adopting new methodological approaches including the use of multiple means of analysis. The article finally challenges the nature of the underpinning theory and questions the reason that so much of what is understood is still based in the field of sociology in tourism, with very little underpinning theory dedicated to the events industry, despite its emergence as an academic field over a decade ago. © 2009 Cognizant Comm.

"This article reports the development and testing of a theoretical model of the initial stages of recommendation-based decision making by consumers. Although consumers use a variety of recommendation sources, they have different motivations for the use of different sources. The model focuses on the factors that influence the likelihood of consumers using strong-tie sources (e.g., friends and family) and weak-tie sources (e.g., acquaintances or strangers) of recommendations. The factors used in the model are the prior knowledge level of the consumer about the product being considered, the perceived decision task difficulty level, and the type of evaluative cues sought by the consumer. Hypotheses are tested using data collected in an extensive field study with consumers. Two paths or routes of influence on the use of recommendation sources are proposed and confirmed in the study.

Multiple discriminant analysis identified that the variable most differentiating the three groups was quality. Compared with Non-Purchasers and Other Purchasers, Clothing Purchasers described Pueblo to People's clothing as being higher quality. Additionally, Clothing Purchasers had stronger belief in the work performed by ATOs, were more concerned about Latin American people, had traveled more extensively in Latin America, and were more highly educated than Non-Purchasers and Other Purchasers.

"Four groups of marketing students (N=91) viewed color videotapes of four women interviewing for a middle management position, rated each applicant on five management characteristics, and made hiring recommendations for each applicant. The four applicants were videotaped in each offour costumes representing four levels of masculinity. Analysis of variance was used to estimate the effect of costume, person, gender of the respondent, and possible interactions on perception of management characteristics and on hiring decisions. The results showed that masculinity of clothing had a positive effect on (a) the perception of management characteristics, and (b) favorability of hiring decisions. Although gender differences were not statistically significant, females tended to rate the applicants as more forceful and self-reliant and were more likely to hire than were males. © 1988, Sage Publications.

"Despite large increases in the number of new consumer product introductions, little attention has been paid to the integral role of the buyer intermediary. Although previous research by the authors has confirmed various hypotheses on the influence of relevant variables on channel intermediaries' decisions to accept a new product, it could not capture the range of options of a new product's decision environment. This article augments past research by analyzing buyers' accept/reject recommendations for a large number of hypothetical new products. Logistic regression analyses of these data confirmed certain past results: product decisions are found to vary as a function of buyer/product category, gross margin, and product uniqueness. New findings, however, suggest that overall vendor marketing strategy encompasses the most important set of individual attributes influencing buyers' decisions.

"Existing literature provides little guidance to international managers for selling to public-and private-sector companies in emerging countries. This research attempts to fill this gap using the context of India. The study focuses on the criteria used by industrial buyers to evaluate suppliers. Four hypotheses related to the differences in the importance placed on economic criteria, familiarity with the supplier, reliability of the supplier, and other capabilities of the supplier by purchasing managers from public-and private-sector companies in India are proposed and tested. Purchasing managers from private-sector organizations place more importance on economic criteria and other capabilities of the supplier than do purchasing managers from public-sector organizations. However, there is no difference in the importance placed on the reliability of the supplier by public-and private-sector purchasing managers. Also, no differences in the perception of familiarity as a supplier evaluation dimension are found.

"Focus groups are a common tool used in marketing research to determine customers' attitudes about products or services. With careful attention to the basic structure and using selected quantitative enhancements, focus groups can also be used by ergonomists for developing solutions to product and workplace problems. By involving users and supplementing their verbal reactions with 'hard data', focus group results can be understandable to marketeers, engineers, and management. Thus, the methodology gives practitioners an effective means for approaching ergonomic problems and gaining acceptance of their recommendations. This paper describes considerations for selecting participants, requirements of the moderator, and suggestions for designing the focus group session. They are basic focus group elements. Also described are three alternative methods for enhancing the basic procedure—combining it with prior performance testing, using it as a basis for a subsequent decision-making analysis, and incorporating a tradeoff analysis during the session.

"Many knowledge discovery systems have been developed in diverse areas, but few systems address the use of knowledge in decision problems explicitly. This paper presents a decision support system for real-time telemarketing operations using the information extracted from the Bayesian network learning model. A prototype decision support system was developed for AT&T customer-contact employees to provide a recommendation regarding the promotion of a telephone discount plan. The system integrated a Bayesian network learning model (knowledge discovery process) and decision-making technique (influence diagram) to provide real-time decision support. A Bayesian network learning model was used to predict a probability of the customer's response from the previous promotion/response history. The influence diagram framework was used to integrate the predicted probability with the cost and benefit related to the possible actions. It was demonstrated that decision support by the Bayesian network learning model itself can be misleading. However, by linking the Bayesian network learning model with rigorous decision-making techniques such as influence diagrams, the decision support system developed in this paper was shown to provide an intelligent decision advice. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",Ahn J.-H.; Ezawa K.J.,Tactical,10.1016/S0167-9236(97)00009-2,Bayesian network learning; Decision support system; Influence diagrams; Service operations management; Telecommunication applications,5.0,,20,0,Elsevier,"The abstract describes a decision support system designed to aid in real-time telemarketing operations by providing recommendations based on a Bayesian network learning model and influence diagrams.

"As the need for marketing intelligence by sales and marketing managers grows more essential, field sales personnel are increasingly being asked to gather and report information. Many executives realize the potential value of using salespersons to supply information useful to management decision making. The sales force is familiar with their territories, their customers' needs and sources of information inside customer organizations, their competitors' marketing activities, and trends in product acceptance. The incremental costs and effort required are low compared to other research methods, since information can be submitted within the context of a regular call report system [2, 6, 8]. But salespersons have been found to be inadequate and uncooperative reporters in many instances. Numerous field salespersons believe that reporting infringes on their primary responsibility of selling, and furthermore that management apparently doesn't make use of the resulting information anyway. Thus, while salespersons have access to a wealth of marketing information of potentially great value to the firm, they are often inadequate, unreliable, and unmotivated reporters [4, 5].

"This article examines company practice and the advertising budgeting—sales forecasting timing relationship, assessing the key company and organizational variables involved. The data were obtained from a four-page questionnaire mailed to 900 senior marketing executives. Just under three-quarters of companies were found to set their budgets prior or simultaneous to their sales forecasts. The investigation of the remaining companies, those setting their advertising budgets after their forecasts, indicated that the key variables were company size, product category, functional involvement and management process. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that company size and the fragmentation of the budgeting and forecasting decisions may be the most important factors in why some companies set their budgets after the forecast. The main recommendations are that larger companies should strive to link or integrate budgeting—forecasting decisions and that further research should be undertaken to help improve company practices in this respect. © 1995, Advertising Association.

"Almost all of the problems that communities encounter when setting up drug sales schemes can be anticipated by giving careful attention to political, social, economic, managerial and financial factors.; Almost all of the problems that communities encounter when setting up drug sales schemes can be anticipated by giving careful attention to political, social, economic, managerial and financial factors. Problems are often attributable to the inability of governments to provide drugs and to the private sector's unwillingness to sell or distribute them where purchasing power is low. The 1st step is to define the problems of drug supply and their causes. Objectives then become clear. The community has to decide what type of payment it will institute. If prices are set above the people's ability to pay, the scheme will not succeed; if they are set too low, costs will not be fully recovered. Once the type of fee has been chosen, a number of other decisions have to be taken, including selecting drugs and estimating needs, obtaining start-up money, finding a reliable source of drugs, cost-efficient transportation, establishing a community drug depot, and establishing price-setting.

We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield.

"The World Food and Agriculture Organization claims the percentage of the overall world population that will suffer from water scarcity and water stress by 2025 is estimated as 34% and 15%, respectively. Accordingly, it can be estimated that 40% of the 9.4 billion estimated world population will face water shortages by 2050. In this case, the ownership and efficient use of water stand out as common concerns for all communities in the world for today and for the future. In this research, the attitudes of consumers towards water saving were identified and factors that affect these attitudes were analysed within a sample from the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The survey was conducted through a face-to-face survey with 965 households in three Turkish provinces in 2009.

"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the adaptations and perspectives of hotel managers regarding green and smart hotel technologies within the context of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review guided the formulation of this study, followed by face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with hotel managers. A total of 17 prepared questions were finalized after examination by two expert academicians. The responses were analyzed using qualitative research methodology and the results were weighted using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Findings: Interviews with sustainability and operational managers yielded insights into environmentally friendly practices and strategies such as reducing energy and water consumption, waste and chemical reduction, supporting local entrepreneurs and adopting smart technologies. These factors are crucial in eco-friendly hotels. According to the SWARA analysis, 'reducing energy consumption' is the most effective criterion. Research limitations/implications: This study offers insights into green and smart hotel management by focusing on the perspectives of hotel managers with a small sample. In future studies, research with larger samples on customer perspectives and the effect of hotel selection is recommended. Practical implications: This study offers insights to hotel managers on energy conservation and customer satisfaction enhancement through green and technological applications. These technological applications can improve hotel service quality and provide personalized experiences, fostering customer loyalty.

"With the development of smart technology, mobile applications have become more universal and important in our daily life. Meanwhile, online privacy protection has attracted rich attention in both academia and practice. Mobile software functions require the authorization of user information. The misuse of private data poses a great threat to users’ privacy safety. It is a difficult task for developers to mitigate users′ concerns and sensitivity to various private data and improve their application performance based on access to the application permission. Based on the “ minimum authority principle,” this paper explores the impact of permission sensitivity and rationality on software performance. The sample data includes 33,772 records of 5,304 software applications in the Xiaomi app store from January 2018 to December 2019. Firstly, according to whether sensitive information of users is involved, permissions are divided into dangerous and normal groups. Based on the permission lists, “0-1” vectors of various permissions are generated. Secondly, four different permission factors are calculated by the spatial distance algorithm to quantify rationality and sensitivity. Finally, this paper empirically explores the impact of permission factors on application ranking based on the panel data fixed effect regression model, which takes application ranking as the decision result of privacy response behavior. Based on the privacy concern theory, this paper links permission invocation with application performance, proving the negative impact of improper permission mechanisms on application performance. The first section introduces the generation method for the four permission factors. The sensitivity indicator refers to whether the permission requires access to users’ private information or illegally shares or sends personal information to others. According to the classification system of the Android Developer Platform, we can quickly get the dummy variables for permission sensitivity. The reasonability indicator refers to whether the type and number of permissions requested by applications match their functional complexity and category average level. The average permission vector for every category is defined as an estimation of “ the least privilege” that best matches the application function. Then, we use the distance from the “ least privilege vector” to denote the irrationality degree. We can obtain four different permission factors by intersecting these two indicators. Mobile applications with too few normal permissions may have functional defects, while those with too many dangerous permissions may cause users′ privacy concerns. The rationality and sensitivity of permissions jointly affect users′ download decisions and application performance. The second part illustrates the influence mechanism of the four permission factors on application ranking. Dangerous and normal permissions have different impacts on mobile application rankings. Considering the particularity of ranking data, this study uses a rologit regression model combined with lag processing and fixed effect to eliminate the impact of other confounding variables. The results show that permission abuse will lower the ranking of applications in this category. The higher the abuse degree, the lower the ranking. With the same degree of rationality, highly sensitive permissions will increase users′ concerns about privacy and security risks. The impact of insufficient permission application cannot be generalized. Insufficient dangerous permission has a positive impact on ranking; however, insufficient normal permission has no significant impact on app ranking. In the third part, the additional model discusses the regulatory effect of apps’ functional descriptions on the influence mechanism. Software with rich functions usually needs to request more permissions. Users enjoy a high sense of self-anonymity in applications with simplified functions, which will reduce their privacy risk concerns. The consequences of security vulnerabilities will be more severe for complex software. Small changes in permissions may drastically affect the user′s privacy risk estimation and the app ranking. In this case, labelling dangerous permissions lower than the average level and normal permissions higher than the average level both have a significant impact on the application ranking. In general, application permission data is closely related to its market performance. While designing software, developers should fully consider the user′s privacy perception level and reduce the use of dangerous permission as much as possible. Without affecting the core functions of the application, a reasonable balance between normal permissions and dangerous permissions can effectively improve the application ranking and marketing performance. Analyzing the performance impact factors and permission evolution process is of great significance to improve app scores and word of mouth. © (2023), (Zhejiang University).

"The understanding of destination image is a key point for tourism enterprises, local authorities, and policy makers. This study explores the case of Capraia, a small island located in Tuscany, to analyze how tourists (tourism demand) and local operators (tourism supply) create and communicate the island’s online image. This research quantitatively examines online communication on the two sides of the tourism market to monitor the online destination image of the island of Capraia. To build on previous research in this area, this study adopts a web content mining approach to assess the characteristics of content published online. The main dimensions of destination image (as developed in the literature) are used as a basis to create a dictionary for automated content analysis. A total of 24 tourism promotion websites and 9,180 tourist Instagram posts were analyzed. Findings reveal discrepancies between the image proposed by local operators and that perceived by tourists. Local operators mostly communicate general information to discover the destination, while tourists prioritize communication based on emotional appeal and personal experience on the island. This research aims to provide support for local operators and policy makers in decisions relating to communication and in defining the island image. © Island Studies Journal, 2021.",Marchi V.; Raschi A.,Tactical,10.24043/isj.168,Capraia island; content analysis; destination image; destination marketing; text mining; tourist consumer behaviour,5.0,,15,0,Island Studies Journal,"The study provides insights into how local operators and tourists communicate the online image of Capraia, which can inform targeted marketing strategies and campaign optimizations.

Since the global outbreak of COVID-19 the virus has continued to mutate and its immune escape transmission and other capabilities have increased on January 30 2023 the WHO committee unanimously concluded that COVID-19 remains a dangerous infectious disease with the ability to cause significant damage to human health and health systems. Therefore wearing medical protective clothing as an effective form of personal protection plays an extremely important role in personal protection. However the research and development of medical protective clothing in China started late and there is not only the problem of mismatch between application scenarios and product functions but also most research and development are conducted from the perspective of professional medical personnel. In addition consumers apply medical protective clothing in a richer and more diverse scenario and the post-purchase evaluation of consumers can not only reflect their demand for medical protective clothing and influence other consumers' purchase decisions on medical protective clothing but also serve as an important basis for relevant enterprises to consider developing and improving their marketing strategies. To deeply understand current consumer' s view and demand for medical protective clothing this paper based on the collected content of 11 513 consumer reviews of 14 Chinese medical protective clothing brands carried out keyword frequency analysis sentiment analysis network analysis and co-occurrence network analysis accurately revealing the consumers' shopping experience perception and demand. The study shows that product quality and express efficiency are the most important factors influencing consumers' post-purchase evaluation followed by merchant services and application scenarios while affordable price only plays an important role in positive evaluation product quality and packaging are of great concern to consumers in the positive evaluation consumers are quite content with product quality workmanship material size comfort breathability product packaging and gifts express efficiency delivery and logistics speed price cheap price and merchant service customer service staff service attitude and service response speed . The consumers also express the need to buy medical protective clothing for timely and safe protection in daily life during the epidemic and in scenarios such as air travel. In the negative evaluation consumers' dissatisfaction is mainly focused on product quality express efficiency and merchant service such as poor product quality the clothing is too large to be worn the product and related gifts are broken when received and the product material is thin poor express efficiency slow delivery and logistics after the product is ordered and poor merchant service poor customer service attitude no timely response to information omission of products slow invoicing and difficulty to refund . This exploratory study provides new research ideas for consumer experience and valuable reference for the marketing management practices of medical protective clothing enterprises. This study provides valuable reference information for medical protective clothing companies' product and service improvement logistics partner selection product design and development and price marketing strategies by digging deeper into the content of medical protective clothing consumer reviews and outlining more clearly the concerns of consumers in the process of purchasing medical protective clothing. © 2023 China Silk Association.

"China's automotive industry has entered a stage of great growth. Owing to the widespread and rapid information dissemination of online automotive forums, they have become an important source for manufacturers to collect product defect information and understand consumer preferences. The purpose of this study is to investigate car defect information and consumer preferences from online automotive forums and segment consumers based on consumer preferences, which holds great promise as a means for companies to improve product design and consumer relationship management. Based on text data of China's top-ranked Pacific Auto Network, we applied the LDA model, sentiment analysis, text classification, and cluster analysis methods to determine the influencing factors of automobile consumers’ purchasing behavior, identified automobile product defects, and subdivided consumer groups. The results show that the factors affecting consumers’ car buying behavior are low fuel consumption, affordable price, superior performance, fashionable appearance, and comfortable use. Car product defects are mainly reflected in the three aspects of the car's performance, comfort, and configuration; there are six kinds of consumer groups: price seekers, fuel consumption seekers, performance seekers, comfort seekers, cost performance seekers, and appearance seekers. Of these, cost performance seekers make up the largest proportion, and they constitute the largest group of intention purchasers. These findings can help enterprises develop targeted product improvement programs, but also provide a decision-making basis for enterprises to achieve precision marketing. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Sun B.; Mao H.; Yin C.,Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12784,auto forum; consumer groups; online review; product defects; text mining,5.0,,20,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study focuses on segmenting consumers based on their preferences regarding automotive products, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets for product development and marketing.",scopus-text mining,15,60,How to identify product defects and segment consumer groups on an online auto forum,2022
"4.59 billion people worldwide use social networks. Over a billion new posts are uploaded every day to Facebook’s applications (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). Social networks play a central role in consumption and marketing, politics, and social aspects. They affect users' decision-making processes, emotions, and behavior. Content on social media can include, for example, movies, pictures, and texts. The emotion expressed in the post content has an influence on the exposed individuals. Emotions can cause the user exposed to the content to follow another user, view more content raised by a certain user, share a post, or express support (or lack of support), thus affecting the popularity of the user. In this work, we examined the relationship between emotions expressed by a character and popularity measures. As a case study, we analyzed the texts presented in the popular series “Friends” over ten seasons. We found that women in the series express more emotions in general and, in particular, more emotions of anticipation, joy, trust, and fear. The findings show the relationship between different emotions expressed in the content and various popularity measures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Porter I.; Galam B.; Ramon-Gonen R.,Tactical,10.1007/s13278-023-01133-5,Emotion detection; Popularity measures; Social network analysis; Text mining,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the relationship between emotions expressed in social media content and their impact on user behavior and popularity, indicating a focus on user engagement strategies and content optimization.",scopus-text mining,10,70,Emotion detection and its influence on popularity in a social network-based on the American TV series friends,2023
"The smart speaker market, which is considered an early-stage market, is expected to grow rapidly as smart speakers become a part of daily life. Consequently, manufacturers are trying to dominate the market. To achieve this, they must analyze users' reactions to their products and find insights for product improvement through comparison with competitors. We propose a four-step methodological framework for identifying meaningful opinions from a large number of online user reviews. First, network analysis is conducted to compare differences between brands. Next, through topic modeling, the attributes of speakers that users consider the most crucial are extracted for each brand. Third, sentiment analysis is conducted to examine how users' emotional polarities differ for each attribute. Through this, product improvement and product sales plans can be derived. Finally, in order to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each brand, brand positioning is conducted and user opinions that have changed along with the evolution of the speaker's generation are analyzed. Our study identified the factors that positively or negatively affect the experience of smart speaker users. In addition, the proposed method is highly useful because it can be used to derive insights from a large amount of user opinion data regardless of the search term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Park J.; Yang D.; Kim H.Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103186,Brand positioning; Decision support; Online review; Sales planning; Smart speaker; Text analysis,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses a methodological framework for analyzing user opinions and improving products based on user feedback, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into specific actions and targets for product development and marketing analytics.",scopus-text mining,10,70,Text mining-based four-step framework for smart speaker product improvement and sales planning,2023
"This study aimed to identify a new framework for consumer perceived value (CPV) and evaluate the dynamics of relative importance of different dimensions of CPV in the context of mobile marketing. Laddering interviews were conducted to capture the essence of CPVs, and then text-mining techniques were applied to extract key consumer values from the interviews. Six dimensions of CPV, namely, design, emotional, functional, monetary, guarantee, and social, were identified. The construct validity of these six dimensions was demonstrated through a rigorous sorting process. A best–worst scaling (BWS) survey was then implemented based on these six value dimensions to investigate consumers’ preference for each dimension in three critical decision-making phases of mobile marketing campaigns. Statistical analysis of the BWS data showed that significant dynamic differences exist among these six value dimensions in each phase.

"PurposeThis study aims to conceptualize the relationship of perceived artificial intelligence (AI) credibility with consumer-AI experiences. With the widespread deployment of AI in marketing and services, consumer-AI experiences are common and an emerging research area in marketing. Various factors affecting consumer-AI experiences have been studied, but one crucial factor - perceived AI credibility is relatively underexplored which the authors aim to envision and conceptualize.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a conceptual development approach to propose relationships among constructs, supported by 34 semi-structured consumer interviews.FindingsThis study defines AI credibility using source credibility theory (SCT). The conceptual framework of this study shows how perceived AI credibility positively affects four consumer-AI experiences: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social interaction. Perceived justice is proposed to mediate this effect. Improved consumer-AI experiences can elicit favorable consumer outcomes toward AI-enabled offerings, such as the intention to share data, follow recommendations, delegate tasks, and interact more. Individual and contextual moderators limit the positive effect of perceived AI credibility on consumer-AI experiences.Research limitations/implicationsThis study contributes to the emerging research on AI credibility and consumer-AI experiences that may improve consumer-AI experiences. This study offers a comprehensive model with consequences, mechanism, and moderators to guide future research.Practical implicationsThe authors guide marketers with ways to improve the four consumer-AI experiences by enhancing consumers' perceived AI credibility.Originality/valueThis study uses SCT to define AI credibility and takes a justice theory perspective to develop the conceptual framework.","Khan, AW; Mishra, A",Tactical,10.1108/JSTP-03-2023-0108,AI credibility; Consumer-AI experience; Source credibility theory; Justice theory; Personalization; Customization,5.0,,20,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on enhancing consumer-AI experiences through perceived AI credibility, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at improving marketing strategies and consumer engagement.

"With every changing product and service landscape the customer needs and their expectations are also evolving. In terms of quick delivery and quick response to customer queries an organization is left with no choice but to adapt to the latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Artificial Intelligence is the capacity of machines to recognize, learn and make decision from its surrounding environment. This paper is an attempt to identify the ways how artificial intelligence is transforming marketing. It also aims to study the impact of awareness of AI on perception of use of AI with reference to different uses of AI during the customer journey. The select sample belongs to the area of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Correlation and regression results showed that impact of awareness of AI on perception of use of AI with reference to voice search was found to be having significant influence. However, it was found that there was no impact of awareness of AI on perception of other four uses in the study.

"PurposeThe recent pandemic disrupted the way in which businesses transact with each other. In response to maintaining cleanliness in business-to-business (B2B) settings, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robots have been adopted as substitutes for cleaning personnel, yet their implications remain largely underexamined. This study aims to examine B2B buyer responses to cleaning information notices (human vs AI-enabled agent) placed at either the entry to the premises or the sales counter, thereby adding to the nascent literature in this line of inquiry.Design/methodology/approachThree field experiments were conducted across diverse B2B businesses (wholesalers in Studies 1-2 and a commercial business in Study 3). To achieve greater empirical rigor and generalizability, this research used diverse stimuli across different B2B settings. In addition, the results ruled out alternate explanations and shed light upon political ideology as a boundary condition. Finally, a single-paper meta-analysis confirmed H1, consolidating the established effect.FindingsFeaturing over 1,000 B2B buyers, the results show that politically liberal B2B buyers express greater preference for human over AI-performed cleaning while labor-orientated buyers are indifferent. Importantly, this effect is driven by greater relaxation associated with humans, which in turn, increases their future patronage and referral intent.Originality/valueThe results enrich the collective knowledge of the adoption of AI-enabled robots, reinforcing for marketing practitioners and businesses that the reliance on human-based outcomes remains a preferred touchpoint in B2B settings, particularly for liberals.","van Esch, P",Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-03-2023-0126,Artificial intelligence (AI); Future patronage intent; Political ideology; Referral intent; Relaxation; State-based emotions,0.0,,15,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study examines B2B buyer responses to cleaning information notices, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing that interprets strategic goals into specific targets and actions.

"TikTok is increasingly influential in promoting brand awareness and boosting purchase intention. From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers' purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5 -point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%.

"This study investigated the impact of anthropomorphism on customers' decisions to use artificial intelligence (AI) devices in hotels, along with other traditional predictors. The study's model considered the co-occurrence of positive and negative effects of anthropomorphism, including social presence and identity threats, which compete to control evaluative attitudes toward AI devices. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the model using data from 363 participants. The results showed that anthropomorphism positively enhances social presence, leading to higher performance expectancy and positive emotions toward AI devices. Anthropomorphism also entails identity threats, resulting in increased effort expectancy and negative emotions. These trade-offs highlight the need for hotels to consider how customers perceive and respond to anthropomorphized AI devices during service delivery and to choose the level of anthropomorphism accordingly.

"Many B2B firms have widely accepted AI-based chatbots to provide human-like service interaction at different customer touchpoints in recent years. One of the objectives behind introducing this technology is to provide an enhanced, live channel Customer Experience (CX) all round the clock. Researchers have focused on delivering the CX by improvising the chatbot's internal algorithm, giving limited attention to CX theories from management literature, which leaves a gap. With the proposed paper, we have investigated the influencing factors of AI-based chatbots from the lens of CX theories for B2B firms. In this paper, a model for organizing CX has been proposed using the diffusion of innovation theory, trust commitment theory, information systems success model, and Hoffman & Novak's flow model for the computer-mediated environment and verified using the social media data. The methodology used for this study is the social media analytics-based content analysis method (sentiment analysis, hierarchical clustering, topic modeling) for data preparation, followed by lasso and ridge regression for model verification.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and human employees have emerged as the dominant forms of online customer service. However, existing research rarely connects the service differences between them in terms of product type, ignoring the interactivity between the two. This study reveals the effect of matching customer service type (AI chatbot vs. human) to product type (search vs. experience) on consumers' purchase intentions through four experiments, revealing the psychological mechanism and boundary condition for the existence of this effect. It shows that (1) the match between customer service type and product type positively affects consumers' purchase intentions; (2) this matching effect is mediated by processing fluency and perceived service quality; and (3) the matching effect works only when consumers' demand certainty is low. These findings enrich the theoretical study of online customer service, and provide marketing insights for companies to improve the adoption of AI chatbots and human employees.","Chen, SL; Li, XL; Liu, KC; Wang, XS",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21862,artificial intelligence; chatbot; demand certainty; human employee; online customer service; processing fluency; product type,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The study focuses on the interaction between AI chatbots and human employees in online customer service and their impact on consumer purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing strategies and customer engagement.",wos-ai,10,70,Chatbot or human?

"Based on a sample of 77 highly innovative products, this study examines the usage and the relative importance of a set of go/no-go decision criteria at four major gates of the new product development (NPD) process. The findings reveal that go/no-go criteria can be grouped into five dimensions: strategic fit, technical feasibility, customer acceptance, market opportunity, and financial performance. Strategic fit dimension is mainly applied in approving the new product concept. Technical feasibility dimension is crucial in approving the new product concept and the product prototype. The usage of customer acceptance dimension is notably high throughout the entire development process, particularly after product launch. Market opportunity dimension is mostly employed to approve the new product concept and the maintenance of the product on the market. Financial performance dimension stands out near the end of the development process. 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI-human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees' creativity in answering customers' questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees' interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills.","Jia, N; Luo, XM; Fang, Z; Liao, CC",Tactical,10.5465/amj.2022.0426,,5.0,,15,0,ACAD MANAGEMENT,"The abstract discusses AI assistance in enhancing employee creativity and performance in a specific context (telemarketing), which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving structured targets and optimizing processes.",wos-ai,10,70,WHEN AND HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUGMENTS EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY,2024
"PurposeMachine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly important in enabling business-to-business (B2B) companies to offer personalized services to business customers. On the other hand, humans play a critical role in dealing with uncertain situations and the relationship-building aspects of a B2B business. Most existing studies advocating human-ML augmentation simply posit the concept without providing a detailed view of augmentation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how human involvement can practically augment ML capabilities to develop a personalized information system (PIS) for business customers.Design/methodology/approachThe authors developed a research framework to create an integrated human-ML PIS for business customers. The PIS was then implemented in the energy sector. Next, the accuracy of the PIS was evaluated using customer feedback. To this end, precision, recall and F1 evaluation metrics were used.FindingsThe computed figures of precision, recall and F1 (respectively, 0.73, 0.72 and 0.72) were all above 0.5; thus, the accuracy of the model was confirmed. Finally, the study presents the research model that illustrates how human involvement can augment ML capabilities in different stages of creating the PIS including the business/market understanding, data understanding, data collection and preparation, model creation and deployment and model evaluation phases.Originality/valueThis paper offers novel insight into the less-known phenomenon of human-ML augmentation for marketing purposes.

"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to comprehend how AI aids marketers in engaging customers and generating value for the company by way of customer engagement (CE). CE is a popular area of research for scholars and practitioners. One area of research that could have far-reaching ramifications with regard to strengthening CE is artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, it becomes extremely important to understand how AI is helping the marketer reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. Design/methodology/approachA detailed approach using both systematic review and bibliometric analysis was used. It involved identifying key research areas, the most influential authors, studies, journals, countries and organisations. Then, a comprehensive analysis of 50 papers was carried out in the four identified clusters through co-citation analysis. Furthermore, a content analysis of 42 articles for the past six years was also conducted. FindingsEmerging themes explored through cluster analysis are CE concepts and value creation, social media strategies, big data innovation and significance of AI in tertiary industry. Identified themes for content analysis are CE conceptualisation, CE behaviour in social media, CE role in value co-creation and CE via AI. Research limitations/implicationsCE has emerged as a topic of great interest for marketers in recent years. With the rapid growth of digital media and the spread of social media, firms are now embarking on new online strategies to promote CE (Javornik and Mandelli, 2012). In this review, the authors have thoroughly assessed multiple facets of prior research papers focused on the utilisation of AI in the context of CE. The existing research papers highlighted that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants offer real-time interaction capabilities, swiftly addressing inquiries, delivering assistance and navigating customers through their experiences (Cheng and Jiang, 2022; Naqvi et al., 2023). This rapid and responsive engagement serves to enrich the customer's overall interaction with the business. Consequently, this research can contribute to a comprehensive knowledge of how AI is assisting marketers to reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. This study also sheds light on both the attitudinal and behavioural aspects of CE on social media. While existing CE literature highlights the motivating factors driving engagement, the study underscores the significance of behavioural engagement in enhancing firm performance. It emphasises the need for researchers to understand the intricate dynamics of engagement in the context of hedonic products compared to utilitarian ones (Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut, 2020). CEs on social media assist firms in using their customers as advocates and value co-creators (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Sawhney et al., 2005). A few of the CE themes are conceptual in nature; hence, there is an opportunity for scholarly research in CE to examine the ways in which AI-driven platforms can effectively gather customer insights. As per the prior relationship marketing studies, it is evident that building relationships reduces customer uncertainty (Barari et al., 2020). Therefore, by using data analysis, businesses can extract valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviour, equipping them to engage with customers more effectively. Practical implicationsThe rapid growth of social media has enabled individuals to articulate their thoughts, opinions and emotions related to a brand, which creates a large amount of data for VCC. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a radical way of providing value content to users. It expands on a broader concept of how software and algorithms work like human beings. Data collected from customer interactions are a major prerequisite for efficiently using AI for enhancing CE. AI not only reduces error rates but, at the same time, helps human beings in decision-making during complex situations. Owing to built-in algorithms that analyse large amounts of data, companies can inspect areas that require improvement in real time. Time and resources can also be saved by automating tasks contingent on customer responses and insights. AI enables the analysis of customer data to create highly personalised experiences. It can also forecast customer behaviour and trends, helping businesses anticipate needs and preferences. This enables proactive CE strategies, such as targeted offers or timely outreach. Furthermore, AI tools can analyse customer feedback and sentiment across various channels. This feedback can be used to make necessary improvements and address concerns promptly, ultimately fostering stronger customer relationships. AI can facilitate seamless engagement across multiple digital channels, ensuring that customers can interact with a brand through their preferred means, be it social media, email, or chat. Consequently, this research proposes that practitioners and companies can use analysis performed by AI-enabled systems on CEB, which can assist companies in exploring the extent to which each product influences CE. Understanding the importance of these attributes would assist companies in developing more memorable CE features. Originality/valueThis study examines how prominent CE and AI are in academic research on social media by identifying research gaps and future developments. This research provides an overview of CE research and will assist academicians, regulators and policymakers in identifying the important topics that require investigation.","Gupta, Y; Khan, FM",Tactical,10.1108/JM2-01-2023-0016,Artificial intelligence; Customer engagement; Social media; Value co-creation; Literature review,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses how AI is utilized in customer engagement (CE) and specific strategies marketers can use to leverage AI for enhancing CE, aligning closely with tactical decision-making focused on structured targets and strategies.",wos-ai,20,60,Role of artificial intelligence in customer engagement: a systematic review and future research directions,2024

"Technology and media are delivering content that is transforming society. Providers must compete for consumer attention to sell their digital information goods effectively. This is challenging, since there is a high level of uncertainty associated with the consumption of such goods. Service providers often use free programming to share product information. We examine the effectiveness of content sampling strategy used for on-demand series dramas, a unique class of entertainment goods. The data were extracted from a large set of household video-on-demand (VoD) viewing records and combined with external data sources. We extended a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to handle censored data, which permitted us to explore the main causal relationships. Relevant theories in the marketing and information systems disciplines informed our research on consumer involvement and informedness for decision making under uncertainty, the consumption of information goods, and seller strategies for digital content. The results show that content sampling stimulates higher demand for series dramas, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Samples of the series reveal quality information to consumers and allow them to assess preference fit directly. As a result, they become more informed about their purchase decisions. Also, households seem to be willing to pay more to be better informed, and informed households tend to purchase more. This suggests that content providers should invest in strategies that help consumers to understand the preference fit of information goods.","Hoang, AP; Kauffman, RJ",Tactical,10.1080/07421222.2018.1451958,content sampling; data censoring; digital entertainment; household informedness; information asymmetry; information goods; online content; preference fit; propensity score matching; video-on-demand,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the effectiveness of content sampling strategies for on-demand series dramas, which involves structured decision-making regarding marketing tactics to enhance consumer engagement and purchasing behavior.

"Despite being critical to continuous technology usage, research on remote mobile payments (m-payments) post-adoption usage has received much less attention. Furthermore, information systems usage research has traditionally been positively oriented, generally assuming that the inhibiting and enabling factors influencing technology usage as being the opposite sides of one dimension, which may result in overlooking antecedents to technology continuance. Therefore, this study aims to explore the inhibiting factors that may directly influence customers' intention to discontinue m-payments during post-adoption usage. Drawing on behavioral theories, information systems, and marketing research, this study explores the inhibiting factors directly influencing consumers' intentions to discontinue using m-payments. Survey data were collected from 254 current users in the UK and the PLS-SEM technique is employed to test hypotheses. The results show that poor quality of system, information, and service, as usage inhibitors, directly influence consumers' discontinuance intentions. Importantly, usage frequency is found to have no moderating effect on the inhibitors of continuance intention, supporting the notion about different and asymmetric effects that negative factors can have on technology usage compared to positive ones. This interesting finding suggests that negative user experience will have different and asymmetric effects on intentions to use m-payments than positive user experience.","Koghut, M; AI-Tabbaa, O",Tactical,10.3390/admsci11010018,mobile payment; discontinuance intention; usage inhibitors; information system success model; asymmetric effect,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The study explores specific factors influencing consumers' intentions regarding the discontinuance of mobile payments, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on concrete targets and structured decisions in marketing.",wos-ai,10,70,Exploring Consumers' Discontinuance Intention of Remote Mobile Payments during Post-Adoption Usage: An Empirical Study,2021
"Purpose - The current research aims to analyze antecedents and consequences of using the information provided by customers involved in new service development (NSD). It also seeks to examine the moderating effect of technological turbulence on the antecedents and consequences of information use. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from service firms in a variety of industrial sectors. Unit of analysis was a NSD project in which current or potential customers were involved during its development process. A self-administered mail survey was used to collect the data. A total of 102 complete questionnaires were returned. The proposed model was tested using partial least squares. Findings - The results indicate that the instrumental use of the information collected from customers involved in NSD can lead to higher service advantage and service newness and in turn to higher market performance. Findings reveal that higher recording and reviewing of information collected from customers involved in NSD result in greater use of the information during the NSD process. An important result is that under technologically turbulent environments, recording and reviewing information from customers involved in NSD is less likely to result in a higher instrumental use of such information. Finally, the authors' results show that when technological turbulence is high the instrumental use of information from customers involved in NSD has lower value for both service advantage and service newness. Originality/value - Findings confirm the importance of customer involvement for NSD in a business context. Using the information from customers involved in NSD to resolve specific problems or make decisions regarding NSD projects can result in enhanced service performance. Moreover, information processing capabilities are key antecedents to instrumental information use.

"Purpose The transition to omnichannel retail is the recognized future of retail, which uses digital technologies (e.g. augmented reality shopping assistants) to enhance the customer shopping experience. However, retailers struggle with the implementation of such technologies in brick-and-mortar stores. Against this background, the present study investigates the impact of a smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant application, which uses personalized recommendations and explainable artificial intelligence features on customer shopping experiences. Design/methodology/approach The authors follow a design science research approach to develop a shopping assistant application artifact, evaluated by means of an online experiment (n = 252), providing both qualitative and quantitative data. Findings Results indicate a positive impact of the augmented reality shopping assistant application on customers' perception of brick-and-mortar shopping experiences. Based on the empirical insights this study also identifies possible improvements of the artifact. Research limitations/implications This study's assessment is limited to an online evaluation approach. Therefore, future studies should test actual usage of the technology in brick-and-mortar stores. Contrary to the suggestions of established theories (i.e. technology acceptance model, uses and gratification theory), this study shows that an increase of shopping experience does not always convert into an increase in the intention to purchase or to visit a brick-and-mortar store. Additionally, this study provides novel design principles and ideas for crafting augmented reality shopping assistant applications that can be used by future researchers to create advanced versions of such applications. Practical implications This paper demonstrates that a shopping assistant artifact provides a good opportunity to enhance users' shopping experience on their path-to-purchase, as it can support customers by providing rich information (e.g. explainable recommendations) for decision-making along the customer shopping journey. Originality/value This paper shows that smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant applications have the potential to increase the competitive power of brick-and-mortar retailers.","Zimmermann, R; Mora, D; Cirqueira, D; Helfert, M; Bezbradica, M; Werth, D; Weitzl, WJ; Riedl, R; Auinger, A",Tactical,10.1108/JRIM-09-2021-0237,Digital retail; Digital shopping assistant; Recommender systems; Explainable artificial intelligence; Retail sales,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on the development and evaluation of a smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant application, which aligns with tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into practical implementations and targets for enhancing customer shopping experiences.",wos-artificial intelligence,15,65,Enhancing brick-and-mortar store shopping experience with an augmented reality shopping assistant application using personalized recommendations and explainable artificial intelligence,2023
"Up to the present, various methods such as data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have been used to get the best assessment from huge and important data resources. Deep learning, one of these methods, is an extended version of artificial neural networks. Within the scope of this study, a model has been developed to classify the success of tele-marketing with different machine learning algorithms, especially with deep learning algorithms. Naive Bayes, C5.0, Extreme Learning Machine, and Deep Learning algorithms have been used for modelling. To examine the effect of class label distribution on model success, synthetic minority oversampling technique has been used. The results have revealed the success of deep learning and decision trees algorithms. When the data set was not balanced, the deep learning algorithm performed better in terms of sensitivity. Among all models, the best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and F-score have been achieved with the C5.0 algorithm.","Koçoglu, FÖ; Esnaf, S",Tactical,10.4018/IJBAN.298014,Class Label Distribution; Classification; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Network; Machine Learning; Tele-Marketing Banking,5.0,,10,0,IGI GLOBAL,"The abstract discusses the development of a model to classify tele-marketing success using various machine learning algorithms.

"Undoubtedly, customer relationship management has gained its importance through the statement that acquiring a new customer is several times more costly than retaining and selling additional products to existing customers. Consequently, marketing practitioners are currently often focusing on retaining customers for as long as possible. However, recent findings in relationship marketing literature have shown that large differences exist within the group of long-life customers in terms of spending and spending evolution. Therefore, this paper focuses on introducing a measure of a customer's future spending evolution that might improve relationship marketing decision making. In this study, from a marketing point of view, we focus on predicting whether a newly acquired customer will increase or decrease his/her future spending from initial purchase information. This is essentially a classification task. The main contribution of this study lies in comparing and evaluating several Bayesian network classifiers with statistical and other artificial intelligence techniques for the purpose of classifying customers in the binary classification problem at hand. Certain Bayesian network classifiers have been recently proposed in the artificial intelligence literature as probabilistic white-box classifiers which allow to give a clear insight into the relationships between the variables of the domain under study. We discuss and evaluate several types of Bayesian network classifiers and their corresponding structure learning algorithms. We contribute to the literature by providing experimental evidence that: (1) Bayesian network classifiers offer an interesting and viable alternative for our customer lifecycle slope estimation problem; (2) the Markov Blanket concept allows for a natural form of attribute selection that was very effective for the application at hand; (3) the sign of the slope can be predicted with a powerful and parsimonious general, unrestricted Bayesian network classifier; (4) a set of three variables measuring the volume of initial purchases and the degree to which customers originally buy in different categories, are powerful predictors for estimating the sign of the slope, and might therefore provide desirable additional information for relationship marketing decision making.

"Purpose This research set out to examine how financial advice provided by a human advisor (vs robo-advisor) influences investment intentions in a retail banking context. Design/methodology/approach In two experiments, between-subjects experimental designs were employed to test the primary hypothesis and identify the underlying causal mechanisms that influence consumer investment decisions. Findings The results from two experiments indicate consumers have more belief in financial advice provided by a human financial advisor (vs robo-advisor), when the level of involvement is high. The authors also identify customer belief in the information and the customer's perception of the bank's customer focus as the causal mechanisms that have downstream effects on investment intentions. Originality/value This research is the first to examine how financial advice received from a human advisor (vs robo-advisor) influences investment intentions in a retail banking context. Furthermore, this research identifies high involvement as a key boundary condition moderating the effects on investment intention and identifies consumer belief in the advice, as well as the bank's perceived level of customer focus as the causal mechanisms influencing investment intentions.","Northey, G; Hunter, V; Mulcahy, R; Choong, K; Mehmet, M",Tactical,10.1108/IJBM-09-2021-0439,Artificial intelligence; Banking; Trust; Customer orientation; Robo-advisor,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The research examines how financial advice influences consumer investment intentions, fitting into tactical decision-making by interpreting strategic goals into structured actions that can directly affect customer engagement and investment behavior.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,70,Man vs machine: how artificial intelligence in banking influences consumer belief in financial advice,2022
"Competition between marketing strategies of enterprises shifts to the use of artificial intelligence and begins to be considered in the context of competition between Data Science projects. Therefore, the issue of developing methodology and building a model in a particular area is relevant, which will make the project quite effective and ensure the achievement of goals for the company. The banking services market has a certain specificity of consumer behaviour, so forming marketing strategies is a somewhat complex process. Thus, banks face the task of maintaining the loyalty of their existing customers and attracting new ones. This article aims to build a marketing strategy to attract new customers in the banking sector using Data Science tools. The result of the study is the construction of two econometric models of the different bank's credit products: cash loans and credit cards, which determine the influence of various factors on this process and helps to distribute the advertising budget between different types of advertising. Using the built model, it was determined that advertising campaigns directly affect the increase in the number of new customers in the bank and the overall growth of brand knowledge about the banking institution in society. In addition, the determined weights of each influencing factor helped form an advertising budget, which increased customer inflows by 12%, with an average ROI of 3.18. Taking all into account, the model had shown its effectiveness in organising the bank's advertising campaign when decisions were made using Data Science technologies. The results obtained based on the models give a fairly clear understanding of the factors influencing the inflow of new customers in the bank, which will model the distribution of the budget for advertising campaigns in future periods and predict their effectiveness. Competition in the country's financial sector is forcing banking institutions to use data science in their marketing activities.","Zatonatska, T; Hubska, M; Shpyrko, V",Tactical,10.21272/mmi.2022.2-11,bank; marketing activity; advertising; regression; involvement of new clients; Data Science,5.0,,15,0,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY","The abstract discusses the development of marketing strategies using Data Science tools, focusing on specific campaigns, budget allocation, and customer acquisition in the banking sector, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,70,MARKETING STRATEGIES IN THE BANKING SERVICES SECTOR WITH THE HELP OF DATA SCIENCE,2022
"Purpose Artificial neural network (ANN) models, part of the discipline of machine learning and artificial intelligence, are becoming more popular in the marketing literature and in marketing practice. This paper aims to provide a series of tests between ANN models and competing predictive models. Design/methodology/approach A total of 46 pairs of models were evaluated in an objective model-building environment. Either logistic regression or multiple regression models were developed and then were compared to ANN models using the same set of input variables. Three sets of B2B data were used to test the models. Emphasis also was placed on evaluating small samples. Findings ANN models tend to generate model predictions that are more accurate or the same as logistic regression models. However, when ANN models are compared to multiple regression models, the results are mixed. For small sample sizes, the modeling results are the same as for larger samples.

"Customization and personalization services are a critical success factor for Internet stores and Web service providers. This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules For personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique For personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.","Kim, JW; Lee, BH; Shaw, MJ; Chang, HL; Nelson, M",Tactical,10.1080/10864415.2001.11044215,decision-tree induction; Internet advertising; Internet storefront; machine learning; personalization,5.0,,10,0,M E SHARPE INC,"The paper discusses personalized recommendation techniques aimed at improving marketing efforts in Internet stores, aligning with tactical decision-making focused on specific marketing strategies and customer engagement.",wos-artificial intelligence,15,70,Application of decision-tree induction techniques to personalized advertisements on Internet storefronts,2001
"Purpose Based on the data obtained from a questionnaire of 595 people, the authors explore the relative importance of consumers, checking whether socioeconomic variables influence their centrality, detecting the communities within the network to which they belong, identifying consumption patterns and checking whether there is any relationship between co-marketing and consumer choices. Design/methodology/approach A multilayer network is created from data collected through a consumer survey to identify customers' choices in seven different markets. The authors focus the analysis on a smaller kinship and cohabitation network and apply the LART network community detection algorithm. To verify the association between consumers' centrality and variables related to their respective socioeconomic profile, the authors develop an econometric model to measure their impact on consumer's degree centrality. Findings Based on 595 responses analysing individual consumers, the authors find out which consumers invest and which variables influence consumers' centrality. Using a smaller sample of 70 consumers for whom they know kinship and cohabitation relationships, the authors detect communities with the same consumption patterns and verify that this may be an adequate way to establish co-marketing strategies. Originality/value Network analysis has become a widely used technique in the extraction of knowledge on consumers. This paper's main (and novel) contribution lies in providing a greater understanding on how multilayer networks represent hidden databases with potential knowledge to be considered in business decisions.

"To be competitive in contemporary turbulent environments, firms must be capable of processing huge amounts of information, and effectively convert it into actionable knowledge. This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis.

"Data capture at point of sale, using laser scanning technology, is now commonplace in retail outlets in developed economies. The volume of data collected is enormous (a single UK grocery superstore carries over 15 000 different lines, each with a unique 13 digit barcode and will sell 600 000 items per week). It has been recognized that, where point of sale data can be translated into meaningful information, there is scope for efficiency savings and exploitable competitive advantage. In UK grocery retailing the uses of scanner data have concentrated on operational aspects such as improved ordering systems and staff scheduling. There have, however, been many recent studies, predominantly in the USA, which have examined, using scanner data, the relationship between marketing variables (price, display, advertising, coupons, and other promotions) and customer purchasing behaviour.

We examine scanner data sets for three brand categories and examine properties associated with many time series forecasting methods. Many violations are found with respect to linearity, normality, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity. With this in mind we compare the forecasting ability of neural networks that require no assumptions to two of the more robust time series techniques.

"PurposeThis study aims to explore the role of frontline service employees' (FSEs) awareness that their job can be substituted by smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms (STARA) in their job autonomy and proactive service performance and when these relationships can be buffered. Drawing on the cognitive appraisal theory of stress, the study examined the mediating relationship between FSEs' STARA awareness, job autonomy and proactive service performance and the moderating effects of self-efficacy and resilience on this relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe authors administered two-wave online surveys to 301 South Korean FSEs working in various service sectors (e.g. retailing, food/beverage, hospitality/tourism and banking). The Time 1 survey measured respondents' STARA awareness, self-efficacy, resilience and job autonomy, and the Time 2 survey assessed their proactive service performance.FindingsFSEs' STARA awareness negatively affected their subsequent proactive service performance through decreased job autonomy. The negative association between STARA awareness and job autonomy was weaker when FSEs' self-efficacy was high than when it was low. While the authors observed no significant moderation of resilience, the author found a marginally significant three-way interaction between STARA awareness, self-efficacy and resilience. Specifically, STARA awareness was negatively related to job autonomy only when both self-efficacy and resilience were low. When either self-efficacy or resilience was high, the association between STARA awareness and job autonomy became nonsignificant, suggesting the buffering roles of the two personal resources.Research limitations/implicationsGiven that the measurement of variables relied on self-reported data, rater biases might have affected the findings of the study. Moreover, the simultaneous measurement of STARA awareness, self-efficacy, resilience and job autonomy could preclude causal inferences between these variables. The authors encourage future studies to use a more rigorous methodology to reduce rater biases and establish stronger causality between the variables.Practical implicationsService firms can decrease FSEs' STARA awareness through training in the knowledge and skills necessary to work with these technologies. To promote FSEs' proactive service performance in this context, service firms need to involve them in decisions related to STARA adoption and allow them to craft their jobs. Service managers should provide FSEs with social support and exercise empowering and supportive leadership to help them view STARA as a challenge rather than a threat.Originality/valueDistinct from prior research on STARA awareness and employee outcomes, the study identified proactive service performance as a key outcome in the STARA context.

"Television advertising effectiveness constitutes a key marketing issue. Advertisers rely on program TV ratings to determine advertisement placement because consumers' decisions to view TV commercials are largely influenced by their TV program-viewing behavior. However, high program viewership of television dramas does not always entail high commercial viewership; consumers' motivations for drama consumption play a critical role. In the context of TV drama viewing, we build a two-stage structural model that distinguishes two motivations for TV drama consumption-viewers' liking for a drama and the need for cognitive closure-and demonstrate their contrasting effects on consumers' commercial-viewing behavior. Although both motivations enhance drama-viewing behavior, consumers exhibit an enhanced (vs. diminished) tendency to watch subsequent commercials when they possess heightened liking for the drama (vs. the need for cognitive closure). These findings contribute to extant research on TV commercial-viewing behavior by distinguishing the roles of different drama-viewing motivations. Based on the model estimation results, we conduct a series of simulation studies to generate rich managerial implications. Managerial practices for both advertisers and TV networks are discussed.","Shi, Y; Wang, TT",Tactical,10.1080/08997764.2021.1883916,,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",The abstract discusses the effectiveness of television advertising and how different motivations for drama consumption influence commercial-viewing behavior.

"The pandemic has led to a significant increase in the use of video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Yet little is known about the impact of video conferencing on subsequent consumer decisions. Across six studies, we examine the effects of video conferencing in both consumption (e.g., sales) and nonconsumption (e.g., school and work) contexts and find that video conferencing can trigger greater interest in products that can enhance the self - physically, intellectually, and/or mentally - due to heightened social appearance anxiety. This effect is attenuated when technology allows users to reduce social appearance anxiety (e.g., the use of ring lights or the ability to turn off web cameras) but accentuated when social anxiety is increased (e.g., the use gallery/ speaker views) and is more pronounced among consumers who are low in self-esteem.

"New technologies create novel tensions, such as between providing consumers with greater control over their personal data and enhancing the technological sophistication of firms' offerings (e.g., through automation). Resolving such control-related tensions requires specific, comprehensive conceptualizations and measures of consumers' perceived data control. Drawing from conceptual notions of control, the authors develop a novel, multistage account of control across consumer-firm data exchanges in various traditional (active and passive) and new, hybrid data disclosure settings. By distinguishing, defining, and operationalizing control activities pertaining to the collection, submission, access, and use of personal data, this article proposes a means to capture consumers' subjective control perceptions. Study 1, focused on quantitative measure validation, establishes that consumers can distinguish the four data control activities; Study 2, a qualitative account using depth interviews, reveals that consumers identify the four control activities unprompted and across diverse situations. Collectively, these findings present both theoretical and practical implications. This article concludes with a robust set of research directions for an expanded understanding of data control activities in technology-mediated environments. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

"We propose a human-machine hybrid approach to automating decision making in high human-interaction environments and apply it in the business-to-business (B2B) retail context. Using sales transactions data from a B2B aluminum retailer, we create an automated version of each salesperson, which learns and automatically reapplies the salesperson's pricing policy. In a field experiment with the B2B retailer, we provide salespeople with their own model's price recommendations in real time. We find that, despite the loss of private salesperson information, reducing intertemporal behavioral biases by providing the model's price to the salesperson increases profits for treated quotes by 11% relative to a control condition. Using counterfactual analyses, we show that although the model's pricing leads to higher profitability in most cases, salespeople generate higher profits when pricing out-of-the-ordinary or complex quotes. Accordingly, we propose a machine learning hybrid pricing strategy with two levels of automation. First, a random forest model automatically allocates quotes to either the model or the salesperson based on its prediction of whose pricing would generate higher profits. Then, if the quote is allocated to the model, the model determines the price. The hybrid strategy generates profits significantly higher than either the model or the salespeople.","Karlinsky-Shichor, Y; Netzer, O",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2023.1449,automation; salesforce; pricing; business to business (B2B); field experiment,5.0,,25,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes a hybrid approach to pricing strategies that interprets strategic goals into actionable pricing decisions, fitting well into the tactical decision level.

"Purpose The purpose of this study is to model the consumer journey of admission-based membership services from initial purchase to full-season memberships. Particularly, the study pays attention to customer-owned contacts (purchase behavior) and service-owned contacts (salesperson voice- and text-based communications), to examine longitudinal internal data to determine factors which hinder and propel customers toward full memberships. Design/methodology/approach On the basis of big data supplied by a National Hockey League team, the study uses three simultaneous equations in modeling to account for potential endogeneity related to the likelihood that sales and service personnel are more likely to contact frequent customers. The longitudinal data allow us to map the customer journey over the course of multiple years, compared to typical cross-section studies. Findings The findings show that as customers increasingly own committed points of contact, they are prepared to move to the next level - but rarely skip major steps in the relationship journey. The quantity, type and timing of customer contacts by the service firm may hinder or propel the customer down the path to purchase full memberships. Research limitations/implications The prevalence of big data among service firms should allow researchers to better understand how consumers respond to contact strategies over time, as well as fluctuations in firm performance. The research adds to the customer journey research stream, while meeting the call of researchers to bridge the gap between service marketing research priorities and current practice. Practical implications Sales practices and marketing automation tactics may come at the cost of burning leads and alienating future members. Frequent text-based contacts absent voice-based interactions hinder consumer journey and work against relationship building. Service marketers can learn how to better allocate resources, properly manage and motivate contact strategies and target campaigns to send the right message via the right media at the right time. Originality/value This is the first study to map customer journey for admission-based, membership services. The longitudinal approach across multiple years provides a deep understanding of how customers take steps toward loyal membership status, while also pinpointing potential drawbacks of current contact strategies.","George, M; Wakefield, KL",Tactical,10.1108/JSM-03-2017-0071,Big data; Customer journey; Admission-based services; Contact strategy; Membership services,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on interpreting strategic goals into actionable insights regarding customer journey and contact strategies for membership services.

"An important component of making critical decisions is the ability to accurately predict future performance. This is essential for the sales function of a business, as so many factors hinge on the sales forecast. Accordingly, quantitative data should build projections based on sound data analysis. This study identifies how sales professionals (both sales managers and salespeople) are achieving this, given modern-day tools that are available, as well as the resulting impacts. In addition to some demographics, the study examines the perceptions concerning several forecasting sales force automation components, specifically enterprise resource planning (ERP), and customer relationship management (CRM) software. These perceptions have tremendous impacts on the ability to integrate new state-of-the-art predictive analytic tools to help in the allocation of such resources as time, money, and talent. Perceptions indicate a need to better understand how to integrate the power of CRM, ERP, and other technologies to take advantage of the opportunities provided by such tools.

"Purpose - User acceptance is a necessary precondition to implementing self-driving buses as a solution to public transport challenges. Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach - Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications - This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value - While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment.","Quinones, M; Romero, J; Schmitz, A; Díaz-Martín, AM",Tactical,10.1108/EJMBE-07-2023-0224,Autonomous vehicle; Autonomous shuttle; Driverless shuttle; Self-driving bus; Technology adoption; Technology acceptance; Usage intention; Word-of-mouth; Sustainable mobility; Smart mobility; Robots; UTAUT2,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses factors influencing user acceptance of public autonomous shuttles (PASs) and their word-of-mouth intentions, which are more aligned with structured decision-making processes related to marketing strategies and user engagement.",wos-autonomous,10,70,What factors determine the intention to use and recommend public autonomous shuttles in a real-life setting?,2024
"Digitalisation is a tool for the development of tourism destinations and products. This trend has gained relevance in recent years due to new marketing and distribution processes. Consumers are an increasingly demanding and autonomous market that seeks information, speed and online availability throughout the decision-making process and enjoyment of the trip. Beside, businesses and destinations are committed to strategic lines of online marketing with the aim of expanding the target market, automating processes and streamlining and facilitating the purchase. Moreover, Covid-19 has necessarily accelerated this digitalisation process and users are increasingly using online platforms for their trips. Within this commercial process of digitalisation, tourism service providers must focus on security in order to guarantee a good and quality service. Through a case study and a cluster analysis of travel agencies in Extremadura, as a rural destination, an approach to the web security of the main travel agencies, management groups and commercial groups is carried out. The main objective is to evaluate the real capacity of rural destination marketing through online platforms taking into account web security for users.

"This research aims to empirically examine the interrelationships between online impulse buying tendencies (IBT), hedonic motives, online promotions, impulse purchase decision (IPD), and customer satisfaction. A structured survey instrument was used to collect data from 625 consumers from southern India. After checking the psychometric properties of the survey instrument with structural equation modeling, the moderated-mediation model was analyzed using Hayes PROCESS. The results showed that (i) impulse purchase decision (IPD) mediated the relationship between impulsive buying tendency (IBT) and customer satisfaction (CS), (ii) hedonic motives moderated the relationship between IBT and IPD, and (iii) hedonic motives and online promotions moderate the relationship between IPD and CS. This study contributes to the literature because it provides valuable insight into two-way and three-way interactions among the significant variables in consumer behavior.

"Purpose - Although the wireless internet attracts more and more interest from marketers and researchers, there is little empirical evidence of multinational corporations' (MNCs) adoption of pull-type mobile advertising in global markets. The aim of this study is to fill this research gap, by conducting an empirical survey of the perceptions of MNCs operating in Europe regarding SMS-based mobile advertising adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The study proposes six basic constructs which are thought to influence MNCs' decision-making process on mobile advertising adoption. On this base, a structured questionnaire is developed. The data are obtained by telephone interviews from 53 senior executives of MNCs' subsidiaries in Spain. Findings - Hierarchical regression analysis reveals that branding strategy, facilitating conditions, and security and costs are the strongest determinants of MNCs' mobile advertising adoption. Furthermore, discriminant analysis indicates that Japanese, American, and European firms are statistically classifiable according to their cultural affiliation in terms of their perceptions of mobile advertising adoption. Japanese firms are the least willing to use mobile advertising, while their American counterparts are the most motivated in this regard. Originality/value - While SMS-based mobile marketing has been receiving an increasing attention from both academics and practitioners, there exists little empirical research on this area. In this vein, this study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, the study proposes a conceptual research model based on six basic constructs, which incorporate both theoretical and practical perspectives.

An online between-subjects factorial experimental design with 559 subjects from a consumer panel was performed to test the proposed model. The empirical evidence suggests that congruency should be considered a key moderating variable when assessing the impact of content and messages on social media since it might significantly change how content affects online users' decision-making process. If hotel management is thus unable to properly manage its responses to users' comments in a congruent way, posts related to the ambience dimension become more important.

"The development of information technology (IT) causes an increase in the amount of data to be created, stored and processed for the needs of various organizations. Segmentation is one of the marketing tools can help the organization to promote sales activities and benefit from it. It is important for marketing practitioners and decision makers to understand the concept of predictive modelling and have an understanding of how to use big data for segmentation purposes. Marketing and Information Technology are blending due to digitalization, statistics is becoming more important due to the rise of big data and data mining opportunities. Boarders of different disciplines are becoming vaguer and interconnection of disciplines can be observed more often. The purpose of the study is to create customer segments based on predictive modelling by using big data available in an organization. Data for modelling is used from a non-banking lending company based in Latvia AS 4finance. The process of data mining is described and performed in the study using data provided by the company. For the data mining process and the development of customer segments, the authors selected RapidMiner Studio software and used CRISP-DM data mining methodology. Three types of activities were tested to evaluate the economic benefit of created segmentation model on overall 11321 customers. All customers were segmented into two groups based on the created predictive model - one group contained customers that were predicted to become an inactive and second group with customers that were not predicted to become inactive. All customers were split into three groups containing a similar split of predicted outcome. Three different types of activities were performed with all three groups. As a result, common characteristics of segmentation and predictive modelling were identified. The results of the empirical study show that it is possible to create customer segments by using sophisticated predictive model. This can be achieved without having to write statistical software codes.

"Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV.","Jena, R",Tactical,10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.12.012,Electric vehicles; Deep learning; Big data; Sentiment analysis; India,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The study focuses on understanding consumer sentiment, perceptions, and attitudes towards electric vehicles, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at targeting prospective buyers and informing product features for marketing and manufacturing.",wos-big data,10,70,An empirical case study on Indian consumers' sentiment towards electric vehicles: A big data analytics approach,2020
"Purpose While marketing analytics can be used to improve organizational decision-making and performance significantly, little research exists to examine how the configurations of multiple conditions affect marketing analytics use. This study draws on configuration theory to investigate marketing analytics use in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach This research employs a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis using data collected from a survey of 187 managers in UK SMEs. Findings The key findings show that (1) configurations of multiple conditions provide alternative pathways to marketing analytics use, and (2) the configurations for small firms are different from those for medium-sized firms. Research limitations/implications The research results are based on several key configurational factors and a single key-informant method to collect subjective data from UK SME managers. Practical implications The study helps SMEs to understand that marketing analytics use is influenced by the interaction of multiple conditions, that there are alternative pathways to marketing analytics use, and that SMEs should choose the configuration that fits best with their organizational contexts. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by addressing an important yet underresearched area, i.e. marketing analytics use in SMEs, applying a configurational approach to the research phenomenon.

"In the wake of globalization, rapid advancements took place in every field. Data science and big data emerged as utmost prominent realms and in this nexus, marketing analytics outgrew as a robust discipline. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how data is used as a competitive weapon, in the age of digital globalization, by marketers and if there is any direct relationship between marketing analytics (its measurement, IT infrastructure and barriers to deploy marketing analytics) and sales performance, and then keeping absorptive capacity and top management team advocacy as mediating variables, it is tested that whether they influence such direct relationship. This is a quantitative research; the questionnaire was being administered to 300 respondents (managers with some marketing managers, directors and chief executives). It avails Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) based multivariate analysis. The result records that there is a positively significant impact of measurement of marketing analytics and IT infrastructure on sales performance and in presence of the mediating variables, absorptive capacity and top management team advocacy, the impact of marketing analytics relatively increases on sales performance. However, barriers to deploy marketing analytics appeared insignificant. This research furnishes insights to marketers and e-marketers to improve sales performance and profitability; for properly applying marketing analytics, practitioners need to have proper IT infrastructure with absorptive capacity and top management team advocacy or support.

"Shifting towards a more data-driven culture is a key antecedent of business success in today's digital era. Previous research has paid attention to exploring the influence of marketing analytics on business performance, and rarely examined how the use of marketing analytics influences customer agility and satisfaction. According to the dynamic capabilities view and using previous studies, we developed a conceptual framework to explore the effect of marketing analytics use on customer agility and customer satisfaction. In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a threewave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction.

"Using big data to analyze consumer behavior can provide effective decision-making tools for preventing customer attrition (churn) in customer relationship management (CRM). Focusing on a CRM dataset with several different categories of factors that impact customer heterogeneity (i.e., usage of self-care service channels, service duration, and responsiveness to marketing actions), this research provides new predictive analytics of customer churn rate based on a machine learning method that enhances the classification of logistic regression by adding a mixed penalty term. The proposed penalized logistic regression prevents overfitting when dealing with big data and minimizes the loss function when balancing the cost from the median (absolute value) and mean (squared value) regularization. We show the analytical properties of the proposed method and its computational advantage in this research. In addition, we investigate the performance of the proposed method with a CRM dataset (that has a large number of features) under different settings by efficiently eliminating the disturbance of (1) least important features and (2) sensitivity from the minority (churn) class.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to examine how small- and medium-sized hospitality organisations engage with social media and how social media data are used by their managers to inform business decisions. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was used in this research in which interviews were conducted with top management, comprising the owners/directors and other key managers from small- and medium-sized organisations based in Penang, Malaysia. Fan and Gordon's (2014) categorisation of the social media data analysis process and Simon's (1995) concept of the interactive and diagnostic usage of data were used in the analysis of data. Findings The managers of small- and medium-sized hospitality organisations engage with social media for customer relationship management and the understanding of key main competitors. Social media is used to understand, build and manage relationships with current and potential customers; these activities are also linked to actions taken to protect a company's reputation. Even though, for the companies concerned, data gathering is still at the capture stage with no formal procedures and processes in place, the data are utilised in an interactive way to inform two areas' major business decisions-making, i.e. those related to pricing and promotion and the strategic formulation and reorientation of the business.

"Retailers are interested in understanding which price promotions are profitable and which are not. However, simultaneously estimating the promotion effects of a large number of products on retailer sales and profits is technically challenging for both researchers and practitioners. To address this challenge, this study proposes a Partially Profiled Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Partially Profiled LASSO) model, which can estimate ultra-high-dimensional regression relationships at a low computational cost and control for the endogeneity of promotion depth. The model can flexibly incorporate the time-varying promotion effects and the cross-over effects among the promotions of different products. We conduct an empirical study using data provided by a large retailer over a 5-month period. Our model efficiently identifies products with promotion effects and the promotion effects are significantly associated with certain promotion, product, and category characteristics. The results also show that our model with cross-over effects outperforms the benchmark models that are widely used to handle the high-dimensional predictor matrix (e.g., the standard LASSO and principal component regression methods).

"Purpose This study aims to explore the plausibility of the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) methodology for neuromarketing applications and develop a neurophysiologically-informed model of purchasing behavior based on fNIRS measurements. Design/methodology/approach The oxygenation signals extracted from the purchase trials of each subject were temporally averaged to obtain average signals for buy and pass decisions. The obtained data were analyzed via both linear mixed models for each of the 16 optodes to explore their separate role in the purchasing decision process and a discriminant analysis to construct a classifier for buy/pass decisions based on oxygenation measures from multiple optodes. Findings Positive purchasing decisions significantly increase the neural activity through fronto-polar regions, which are closely related to OFC and vmPFC that modulate the computation of subjective values. The results showed that neural activations can be used to decode the buy or pass decisions with 85 per cent accuracy provided that sensitivity to the budget constraint is provided as an additional factor. Research limitations/implications The study shows that the fNIRS measures can provide useful biomarkers for improving the classification accuracy of purchasing tendencies and might be used as a main or complementary method together with traditional research methods in marketing. Future studies might focus on real-time purchasing processes in a more ecologically valid setting such as shopping in supermarkets. Originality/value This paper uses an emerging neuroimaging method in consumer neuroscience, namely, fNIRS.

"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample.

"Marketers have recognized that the probability of a consumer's (or household's) purchase in a particular product category may be influenced by past purchases in the same category and also, purchases in other related categories. Past studies of crosscategory effects have focused on a limited number of product categories, and they have often ignored intertemporal effects in their analyses. Those studies have generally used multivariate logit or probit models, which are limited in their ability to analyze enormous data sets that contain consumer purchase records across a large number of categories and time periods. The availability of such enormous consumer shopping data sets and the value of analyzing the complex relationships across categories and over time (for example, for personalized promotions) suggest the need for computationally efficient modeling and estimation methods. Such models can capture associations among buying decisions across all product categories and over all time periods for which data are available, but they must also have a tractable and clear model structure that permits meaningful interpretation of the results. We explore the nature of intertemporal crossproduct patterns in an enormous consumer purchase data set using a model that adopts the structure of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs). Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach using the efficient estimation algorithm embodied in the CRBM enables us to process very large data sets and capture the consumer decision patterns for both predictive and descriptive purposes that might not otherwise be apparent. In addition to persistent intertemporal within-category effects, we find that there are also significant intertemporal cross effects between product categories.","Xia, FH; Chatterjee, R; May, JH",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2019.1162,big data; sparsity; regularization; consumer decision patterns; deep learning,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses modeling and estimation methods to analyze consumer purchase patterns, which aligns with tactical decisions in marketing analytics and purchase prediction.

"Under the pressure of surging advertising costs and fierce market competition, a growing number of online merchants are trying to implement new advertising strategies to improve advertising efficiency and increase sales. In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.","Hu, L; Sun, XH; Yu, H; Chung, SH",Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2022.3169392,Advertising; Electronic commerce; Costs; Analytical models; Sun; Pricing; Industries; E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising,5.0,,15,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"The abstract discusses the implementation of targeted advertising strategies (TA) and compares it with mass advertising strategies (MA) in a structured manner.

"This paper examines the challenge for marketing research companies in overcoming consumers' reluctance to participate in surveys in order to provide decision makers with quality data. On the one hand, clients are increasingly demanding more data; these clients are interested in employing and refining many of the trends in business analytics Big Data, data-driven customer relationship management, more sophisticated customer segmentation or simply monitoring customer satisfaction. In order to do this, the clients are demanding more data, more often. On the other hand, marketing research companies are finding it increasingly difficult to get respondents to participate in quantitative studies. The cost of reaching respondents, getting them to begin a survey and, more importantly, complete the survey with thoughtful and honest answers, is decreasing the profit margin for many marketing research companies. How can marketing research companies deal with this difficult dilemma?","Warnock, S; Gantz, JS",Tactical,10.2501/IJMR-2017-005,,5.0,,15,0,MARKET RESEARCH SOC,"The abstract discusses the challenges marketing research companies face in obtaining quality data from consumers for quantitative studies.

"The authors propose a new, exploratory approach for analyzing market structures that leverages two recent methodological advances in natural language processing and machine learning. They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant to assortment-related decisions.","Gabel, S; Guhl, D; Klapper, D",Tactical,10.1177/0022243719833631,market structure analysis; product maps; machine learning; retailing; big data,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The proposed approach focuses on analyzing market structures and deriving product attributes, which directly aids retailers in making targeted decisions regarding product assortment and cross-category complementarity.

"In the age of big data, companies store practically all data on any client transaction. Making use of this data is commonly done with machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost.

"Purpose Risk perception is an essential factor affecting how individuals evaluate risk, make decisions and behave. The impact of risk perception on customer purchase behavior has been widely studied; however, the association has been debated. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior and to examine factors that could moderate it. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted a meta-analysis of this relationship and examined factors that could moderate it. Six databases were comprehensively searched. Two reviewers independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality. Pearson's r was used as the effect estimate. A total of 33 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Findings The results revealed a negative relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior. The geographical region, purchase channel and country development level affected the relationship. The correlation between perceived risk and purchase behavior in European consumers was the highest, followed by the correlation in American consumers; the weakest correlation was found in Asian consumers. For consumers in developed countries, perceived risk had a stronger negative influence on customer purchase behavior than that for consumers in developing countries. The perceived risk of online purchase channels had a stronger negative impact on customer purchase behavior than that of offline purchase channels. Originality/value The findings of this review indicate a direct negative relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this review is the first to meta-analytically summarize the impact of risk perception on customer purchase behavior in social sciences research, and it also illuminates new perspectives for future studies.","Li, ZH; Sha, YZ; Song, XP; Yang, KH; ZHao, K; Jiang, ZX; Zhang, QX",Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-12-2018-0381,Risk perception; Customer; Purchase behaviour; Meta-analysis,5.0,,20,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Consumers generally encounter a multitude of price discounts during a single visit to a retailers' website, yet past research has predominantly examined price discounts in a singular manner. We examine how the influence of a price discount's magnitude on consumer purchase intentions evolves during an online shopping trip. In doing so, we demonstrate that a price discount's magnitude is less predictive of consumers' purchase intentions earlier, but it becomes more predictive later, during an online shopping trip. Thus, placing shallow price discounts early in a shopping visit may enhance the effectiveness of a firm's portfolio of price discounts.","Sheehan, D; Hardesty, DM; Ziegler, AH; Chen, HP",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.06.001,Price discounts; Reference points; Latitude of acceptance; In-store decision-making; Shopper marketing,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses how the timing and magnitude of price discounts can influence consumer purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at optimizing sales promotions and pricing strategies during online shopping.",wos-big data,10,70,Consumer reactions to price discounts across online shopping experiences,2019
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose customer behavior analysis based on real-time data processing and association rule for digital signage-based online store (DSOS). The real-time data processing based on big data technology (such as NoSQL MongoDB and Apache Kafka) is utilized to handle the vast amount of customer behavior data. Design/methodology/approach In order to extract customer behavior patterns, customers' browsing history and transactional data from digital signage (DS) could be used as the input for decision making. First, the authors developed a DSOS and installed it in different locations, so that customers could have the experience of browsing and buying a product. Second, the real-time data processing system gathered customers' browsing history and transaction data as it occurred. In addition, the authors utilized the association rule to extract useful information from customer behavior, so it may be used by the managers to efficiently enhance the service quality. Findings First, as the number of customers and DS increases, the proposed system was capable of processing a gigantic amount of input data conveniently. Second, the data set showed that as the number of visit and shopping duration increases, the chance of products being purchased also increased. Third, by combining purchasing and browsing data from customers, the association rules from the frequent transaction pattern were achieved. Thus, the products will have a high possibility to be purchased if they are used as recommendations.","Alfian, G; Ijaz, MF; Syafrudin, M; Syaekhoni, MA; Fitriyani, NL; Rhee, J",Tactical,10.1108/APJML-03-2018-0088,Association rule; Customer behaviour,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the analysis of customer behavior data and the extraction of patterns to enhance service quality in a digital signage-based online store, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes by focusing on specific targets and structured approaches to improve customer engagement and sales.",wos-big data,15,70,Customer behavior analysis using real-time data processing A case study of digital signage-based online stores,2019
"We study the problem of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits, where a decision maker, under a given maximum-number-of batch constraint and only able to observe rewards at the end of each batch, can dynamically decide how many individuals to include in the next batch (at the end of the current batch) and what personalized action-selection scheme to adopt within each batch. Such batch constraints are ubiquitous in a variety of practical contexts, including personalized product offerings in marketing and medical treatment selection in clinical trials. We characterize the fundamental learning limit in this problem via a regret lower bound and provide a matching upper bound (up to log factors), thus prescribing an optimal scheme for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first inroad into a theoretical understanding of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits. Notably, even a special case of our result-when no batch constraint is present- yields that the simple exploration-free algorithm using the LASSO estimator already achieves the minimax optimal O similar to( root ffiffiffiffiffififfi ) regret bound (s0 is the sparsity parameter or an s0T upper bound thereof and T is the learning horizon) for standard online learning in high dimensional linear contextual bandits (for the no-margin case), a result that appears unknown in the emerging literature of high-dimensional contextual bandits.","Ren, ZM; Zhou, ZY",Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.2023.4895,dynamic batch learning; LASSO; high-dimensional statistics; contextual bandits; sparsity,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the development of an optimal scheme for dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at implementing strategic goals through specific methodologies and techniques.

"Objective: The identification of museum attributes is essential when analysing the different factors that attract visitors and studying it in order to improve efficiency in museums, as this could affect the use of funds for developing a marketing campaign to attract visitors. This paper offers a literature review that considers museum visits and museum attributes before proposing a methodology. Methodology: The use of big data applied to tourism research is vital, as it allows for the consideration of the opinions of museum visitors. The case study in this paper is the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Madrid, Spain. The method for identifying the attributes consists of a textual analysis of TripAdvisor reviews written in English (2500) and Spanish (2500). The information is captured using WebHarvy and is analysed using Nvivo12. Results: After analysing the thousand words that were used most frequently, the main attributes were detected, as well as whether the perception of these attributes was positive or negative. The museum's location and the building itself were the most highly valued attributes. Other attributes that were valued positively were the peripheral services of the museum, such as its food and beverage services. Limitations: The main limitation is that TripAdvisor is not an entirely reliable source of information, so it will be necessary to obtain more reviews to analyse. Practical implications: The identification of attributes allows for improved decision making, as well as facilitating a better understanding of the museum's visitors' perceptions. Being aware of these aspects enables the modification of the museum's services through proposals for changes and improvements.","Orea-Giner, A; Guerrero, TV",Tactical,10.7200/esicm.167.0513.2,Cultural tourism; Textual analysis; Visitor experience; Attributes; Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum,5.0,,15,0,ESCUELA SUPERIOR GESTION COMERCIAL & MARKETING,"The abstract focuses on identifying museum attributes and analyzing visitor perceptions, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at improving marketing strategies and enhancing visitor engagement based on specific feedback and data analysis.",wos-big data,10,70,Textual analysis as a method of identifying museum attributes perceived by tourists: An exploratory analysis of Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Spain,2020

"Group-buying often fails even when there are satisfactory quantities as not enough consumers join in the required time, which can waste seller, purchaser, and platform operator time resources; therefore, the group buying features require further research. Over a 3 weeks period, around 700 million click-stream records from 1,061,770 users from a stable and continuous time series were allocated to groups of 5 min frequency, and a hybrid neural network model developed to simulate group-buying behavior in four experiments, from which it was found that adding to the cart and adding as a favorite were significant group-buying behavior features, and shopping depth was the main demographic feature, but age was not. Compared with previous ambiguous online consumer feature conclusions on gender, the results revealed that the commodity feature was the main determinant for gender feature significance. The college student feature was found to be a pseudo feature, and should connect with other fixed effects such as low income or education level. This paper is the first to construct an online dynamic group-buying community, which is a new type of social network and could provide a new perspective for social commerce research.

"Purpose Technology and market pressures are encouraging localized and small-series production in customer-driven industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the supply chain-, product- and process-design factors for small-series production in EU's textile and apparel industry, to understand configuration decisions, priorities and challenges. Design/methodology/approach An interview study was undertaken with ten companies that represent diverse small-series production models and value chain roles. Interview data was analysed to identify supply network configuration characteristics, decision priorities and challenges. Findings Three small-series production models emerged from the analysis, differing with respect to adoption of process postponement and customization. The findings confirm and extend past research regarding diverse decision priorities and product, process, supply chain structure/relationship configurations. Challenges identified relate to planning (priorities) and implementation (configuration). Whereas competence availability and digital technology challenges are common, several difficulties are linked to production model like tensions related to priorities and small volumes, which are not found with customization. Research limitations/implications Future research can make comparisons with other industry and location contexts; adopt dynamic approaches to distinguish between design and reconfiguration processes; and address indicated paradoxical-tensions. Practical implications The study findings can provide guidance for companies regarding identification of priorities and management of (planning/implementation) challenges impacting small-series production in T&A.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the processes whereby organisational actors can seize the opportunities opened up through social media, and the way in which the relative information is managed. This allows these actors to move their occupational boundaries, exploiting the information for performance measurement purposes. The investigation was carried out within an organisational setting, where most occupational dynamics take place. The focus was on the role of artefacts within these occupational dynamics and the analysis drew upon the notion of boundary objects. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on case studies involving two organisations that make use of social media within and across several departments. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with social media managers, department managers, analysts and financial controllers and senior executives. The results of the qualitative analysis of the interviews were completed with secondary sources of information, company reports, communications, public policies, codes of conduct and social media platform analyses. Findings - This paper has implications for accounting studies, showing how marketing and communications managers entering the field of performance management can take the lead in social media management by collecting information from social media, constructing indicators and gaining ground in several decision-making centres. The findings highlight the role of new artefacts and organisational roles, whose purpose is to build a digital community. This process involves crossing the boundaries between internal functions and the inside and outside environment, with a driving phenomenon becoming visible: hybridisation. Faced with this change, reluctant accountants with a traditional mindset are more likely to observe the process at a distance, focusing more on their routine operations based on conventional data. Originality/value - This paper shows that information derived from social media is already a reality that has gained significance through the construction of boundary objects. The paper highlights a driving phenomenon that is emerging in the surge to occupy the organisational terrain for controlling social media: that of hybridisation. The concept of hybridisation is not new in management accounting studies, but in this study can be applied to carrying out a joint analysis on both the boundary objects and their organisational trajectory. In the context of social media accounting, hybridisation is of central importance if both actors and objects are to be effectively positioned at its boundary.","Arnaboldi, M; Azzone, G; Sidorova, Y",Tactical,10.1108/AAAJ-07-2015-2132,Occupation; Social media; Performance management; Management accounting; Boundary objects; Hybridization,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses how organizational actors can leverage social media for performance measurement and decision-making, which aligns with tactical goals of interpreting strategic objectives into actionable targets within an organization.",wos-big data,20,60,Governing social media: the emergence of hybridised boundary objects,2017
"While there have been many tourism studies exploring business opportunities from online comments, research in the context of sustainable rural tourism is rare. In particular, practitioners involved in rural destinations are usually transformed from farmers who are relatively new to information technology and therefore unable to understand the voices of tourists in a timely and effective manner. Aiming to expand the literature on sustainable rural tourism, this study cuts from tourist satisfaction and proposes a mixed methodology to investigate insights for sustaining rural destinations from online comments. Specifically, the KMeans clustering algorithm is first utilized to discover service attributes that visitors value; then Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), an effective satisfaction analysis tool, is adopted to understand tourist satisfaction; to develop specific sustainable strategies, using an advanced opinion extraction technique this work identified dissatisfaction factors of visitors. 5832 online comments of two adjacent rural destinations (i.e. Hongcun and Xidi) were crawled to validate the proposed methodology. Results show that five service attributes were discovered, including Natural environment, Price, Food, Hospitality, and Culture & heritage; Hongcun's Natural environment and Price require urgent measures, and its Food and Hospitality are at a competitive disadvantage compared to Xidi; detailed factors dissatisfying visitors were identified through opinion extraction technique, based on which specific sustainable strategies are generated for authorities and practitioners.

"Sales managers are unlikely to reap the benefits of implementing predictive analytics applications when salespeople show aversion to or lack understanding of these applications. For managers, it is essential to understand which factors mitigate or exacerbate these challenges. This article investigates these factors by studying the implementation of an application that predicts customer churn. Using 9.7 million transactions from a business-to-business company, the authors develop a predictive model of customer churn, implement it in a field experiment, and study its treatment effects using causal forests. Furthermore, the authors manipulate one specific mitigation strategy proposed by prior literature: the fostering of users' realistic expectations regarding the accuracy of an algorithm. The results show that the effectiveness of the churn prediction application strongly depends on customer characteristics (most importantly the predicted churn probability and prior revenue) and salesperson characteristics (technology perceptions, abilities, and selling orientations). Fostering realistic expectations improves the effectiveness of the churn prediction only under very specific circumstances. Two follow-up stimuli-based experiments conceptually replicate key results of the field study. Therefore, this article helps build theory on predictive sales analytics and provides specific guidance to managers aiming to increase their return on analytics investments.","Habel, J; Alavi, S; Heinitz, N",Tactical,10.1177/00222437221151039,predictive analytics; customer churn; sales management; personal selling; causal forest,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a predictive analytics application for customer churn, which involves structured decision-making processes related to sales management and operational strategies.

"The deployment of loyalty card and other consumer data in geographic research brings opportunities to explore and understand patterns of purchasing behaviour in unprecedented detail. However, valid generalisation re-quires thorough evaluation of their potential bias. We argue that, in competitive markets where consumers can choose to shop across competing retailers, loyalty card data from just one of these may not represent a 'complete' view of all purchases, and that this 'completeness' must be controlled for when assessing bias. To this end, we undertake a UK wide analysis of loyalty card data assembled by a major UK grocery retailer and provide guidelines for their effective deployment in the domains of urban and retail analysis. We assess, for the first time, the 'completeness' of circa 500 million customer transactions recorded by a major customer loyalty programme in representing the overall purchasing patterns of circa 16 million consumers across the entire UK, and develop a method by which to do this. Moreover, no operator has complete national store coverage, and so we suggest ways of accommodating this when conducting analysis using loyalty card data.

"The ubiquity of social media platforms facilitates free flow of online chatter related to customer experience. Twitter is a prominent social media platform for sharing experiences, and e-retail firms are rapidly emerging as the preferred shopping destination. This study explores customers' online shopping experience tweets. Customers tweet about their online shopping experience based on moments of truth shaped by encounters across different touchpoints. We aggregate 25,173 such tweets related to six e-retailers tweeted over a 5-year period. Grounded on agency theory, we extract the topics underlying these customer experience tweets using unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. The output reveals five topics which manifest into customer experience tweets related to online shopping-ordering, customer service interaction, entertainment, service outcome failure, and service process failure. Topics extracted are validated through inter-rater agreement with human experts. The study, thus, derives topics from tweets about e-retail customer experience and thereby facilitates prioritization of decision-making pertaining to critical service encounter touchpoints.","Mishra, M",Tactical,10.1177/14707853211047515,online customer experience; topic modeling; e-retail; Twitter; latent Dirichlet allocation; agency theory,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,The study focuses on analyzing customer experience tweets related to e-retailers and identifies specific topics that can inform decision-making at a structured level.

"User-generated content across social media platforms is playing an increasingly important role in tourism. Understanding tourists' experiences and opinions about tourism destinations has led to numerous opportunities to provide tourism providers with greater insights. Identifying sentiments, detecting topics of interest, and exploring loyalty behaviors from user-generated content can provide valuable direction for managerial decisions. This paper presents a novel and inclusive approach that uses different analytical techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to extract sentiments and topics of interest from tourists' conversational data on TripAdvisor from 2002 to 2019. Sentiment analysis revealed that some touristic locations in Jasper National Park are outperforming others in terms of sentiment scores, despite the fact that tourists less frequently reflect on their experiences at these places on social media. Such higher rankings suggest that average sentiment score can be a more informative measure than simple TripAdvisor rankings. This paper also explores destination loyalty statements using a keyword clustering approach. Previous destination loyalty literature was used to develop a keyword list that was applied to search for expressions of loyalty in online reviews. The robustness of loyalty clusters and optimal number of clusters was also assessed prior to final analysis. Four leading loyalty-focused categories of destination offerings were observed: glaciers, waterfalls, lakes and islands, and hiking and trails.

"Chatbots engage in real-time conversations with customers. Moreover, they can collect data in a digital landscape that is increasingly sensitive to privacy. The objective of this study was to help strategic marketing decision-makers better understand how and where chatbots can be used effectively to gather consumer data. We analyse whether consumers' privacy concerns influence their adoption. Furthermore, we invest if privacy concerns, and subsequently information disclosure, are significantly influenced by the chatbot's location. In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer's website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots. Both relationships are sequentially mediated via higher privacy concerns and less comfort with information disclosure.

"The use of conversational agents (e.g., chatbots) to simplify or aid consumers' purchase decisions is on the rise. In designing those conversational agents, a key question for companies is whether and when it is advisable to enable voice-based rather than text-based interactions. Addressing this question, this study finds that matching consumers' communication modality with product type (speaking about hedonic products; writing about utilitarian products) shapes consumers' choice and increases choice satisfaction. Specifically, speaking fosters a feeling-based verbalizing focus, while writing triggers a reason-based focus. When this focus matches consumers' mindset in evaluating the product type, preference fluency increases, thereby enhancing choice satisfaction. Accordingly, the authors provide insights into managing interactions with conversational agents more effectively to aid decision-making processes and increase choice satisfaction. Finally, they show that communication modality can serve as a strategic tool for low-equity brands to better compete with high-equity brands.","Schindler, D; Maiberger, T; Koschate-Fischer, N; Hoyer, WD",Tactical,10.1007/s11747-023-00987-7,Conversational agent; Digital assistant; Chatbot; Speaking; Choice,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The study focuses on how to effectively design conversational agents for improving consumer decision-making, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable implementations.

"The study aims to analyze the factors that influence customers' inclination to utilize chatbots in banking services. The paper employed the technology acceptance model and utilized structural equation modeling to examine the factors affecting consumers' willingness to embrace chatbot services. The survey evaluated various determinants, including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, privacy concerns, and customer satisfaction. Data were collected from 250 bank customers in the Bombay region of India through an online survey employing a random sampling method. The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS AMOS. This study identifies the aspects of chatbot technology in the banking sector, such as user interface, content, security, and convenience, that influence customers' decisions to adopt this innovative technology. The results of the analysis revealed path coefficients indicating a significant relationship between information security and perceived usefulness ((3 = 0.286; p = 0.005) and between perceived usefulness and intention to use (beta = 0.489; p < 0.001). Additionally, the path coefficients for design, security, and facilitating conditions were beta = 0.281, beta = 0.193, and beta = 0.136, respectively, all of which held nearly equal significance in the study. The inter -correlations among the variables ranged from 0.346 to 0.854 and were statistically significant. In the banking sector, customers' intention to use chatbots is influenced by convenience, efficiency, trust, and personalized experiences. Customers are more likely to embrace chatbots when they provide seamless support and tailored solutions, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.","Shaikh, IAK; Khan, S; Faisal, S",Tactical,10.21511/im.19(4).2023.21,design; information; security; facilities; chatbot; intention,5.0,,15,0,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,"The study focuses on the factors influencing customer decisions regarding the use of chatbots in banking, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets such as user engagement and customer satisfaction.",wos-chatbot,10,70,Determinants affecting customer intention to use chatbots in the banking sector,2023
"Corporate data mining faces the challenge of systematic knowledge discovery in large data streams to support managerial decision making. While research in operations research, direct marketing and machine learning focuses on the analysis and design of data mining algorithms, the interaction of data mining with the preceding phase of data preprocessing has not been investigated in detail. This paper investigates the influence of different preprocessing techniques of attribute scaling, sampling, coding of categorical as well as coding of continuous attributes on the classifier performance of decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. The impact of different preprocessing choices is assessed on a real world dataset from direct marketing using a multifactorial analysis of variance on various performance metrics and method parameterisations. Our case-based analysis provides empirical evidence that data preprocessing has a significant impact on predictive accuracy, with certain schemes proving inferior to competitive approaches. In addition, it is found that (1) selected methods prove almost as sensitive to different data representations as to method parameterisations, indicating the potential for increased performance through effective preprocessing; (2) the impact of preprocessing schemes varies by method, indicating different 'best practice' setups to facilitate superior results of a particular method; (3) algorithmic sensitivity towards preprocessing is consequently an important criterion in method evaluation and selection which needs to be considered together with traditional metrics of predictive power and computational efficiency in predictive data mining.

"Sales and marketing is the indispensable department of an organization which leads to the generation of revenue and building customer relationship. Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns.

"Calibration refers to the adjustment of the posterior probabilities output by a classification algorithm towards the true prior probability distribution of the target classes. This adjustment is necessary to account for the difference in prior distributions between the training set and the test set. This article proposes a new calibration method, called the probability-mapping approach. Two types of mapping are proposed: linear and non-linear probability mapping. These new calibration techniques are applied to 9 real-life direct marketing datasets. The newly-proposed techniques are compared with the original, non-calibrated posterior probabilities and the adjusted posterior probabilities obtained using the rescaling algorithm of Saerens et al. (2002). The results recommend that marketing researchers must calibrate the posterior probabilities obtained from the classifier. Moreover, it is shown that using a 'simple' rescaling algorithm is not a first and workable solution, because the results suggest applying the newly-proposed non-linear probability-mapping approach for best calibration performance.

"When considering a decision tree for the purpose of classification, accuracy is usually the sole performance measure used in the construction process. In this paper, we introduce the idea of combining a decision tree's expected value and variance in a new probabilistic measure for assessing the performance of a tree. We develop a genetic algorithm for constructing a tree using our new measure and conduct computational experiments that show the advantages of our approach. Further, we investigate the effect of introducing diversity into the population used by our genetic algorithm. We allow the genetic algorithm to simultaneously focus on two distinct probabilistic measures-one that is risk averse and one that is risk seeking. Our bivariate genetic algorithm for constructing a decision tree performs very well, scales up quite nicely to handle data sets with hundreds of thousands of points, and requires only a small percent of the data to generate a high-quality decision tree.

"Web design in tourism organizations has become one of the key factors in maintaining a successful travel business. With questions of sustainability plaguing travel agencies, questions on how they should allocate their limited resources for website development to meet changing consumer needs while producing an effective and efficient website linger. This study provides a new technique and tool, decision trees and Weka, that identifies critical attributes that influence quality levels of a customer's experience when visiting a travel agency's website. The exploratory study derived eight evaluation attributes based on the attention, interest, desire, and action model. The study generated decision trees via Weka, a data-mining open-source software platform, to analyze the datasets from a web-based experiment. Results indicate that information quality is the most important attribute in designing the website of a travel agency. Then, attributes that enhance the simplicity of websites, such as ease of use, personalization, and flexible reservations, are considered by the customer when evaluating the website quality. Attractiveness can only contribute to evaluations of a website's quality after usefulness and website simplicity have been determined.

"Although highly relevant for marketing practice, few studies provide conceptual and empirical insights into customer portfolio management. Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.","Homburg, C; Steiner, VV; Totzek, D",Tactical,10.1509/jmkg.73.5.70,customer portfolio management; customer segment value; Markov model; customer relationship management; data mining,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the development of a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model and how to manage customer portfolios dynamically.

"With the rapid development of Web 2.0 applications, social media have increasingly become a major factor influencing the purchase decisions of customers. Longitudinal individual and engagement behavioral data generated on social media sites post challenges to integrate diverse heterogeneous data to improve prediction performance in customer response modeling. In this study, a hierarchical ensemble learning framework is proposed for behavior-aware user response modeling using diverse heterogeneous data. In the framework, a general-purpose data transformation and feature extraction strategy is developed to transform the heterogeneous high-dimensional multi-relational datasets into customer-centered high-order tensors and to extract attributes. An improved hierarchical multiple kernel support vector machine (H-MK-SVM) is developed to integrate the external, tag and keyword, individual behavioral and engagement behavioral data for feature selection from multiple correlated attributes and for ensemble learning in user response modeling. The subagging strategy is adopted to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. Computational experiments using a real-world microblog database were conducted to investigate the benefits of integrating diverse heterogeneous data. Computational results show that the improved H-MK-SVM using longitudinal individual behavioral data exhibits superior performance over some commonly used methods using aggregated behavioral data and the improved H-MK-SVM using engagement behavioral data performs better than using only the external and individual behavioral data.

"Consumers are increasingly relying on other consumers' online reviews of features and quality of products while making their purchase decisions. However, the rapid growth of online consumer product reviews makes browsing a large number of reviews and identifying information of interest time consuming and cognitively demanding. Although there has been extensive research on text review mining to address this information overload problem in the past decade, the majority of existing research mainly focuses on the quality of reviews and the impact of reviews on sales and marketing. Relatively little emphasis has been placed on mining reviews to meet personal needs of individual consumers. As an essential first step toward achieving this goal, this study proposes a product feature-oriented approach to the analysis of online consumer product reviews in order to support feature-based inquiries and summaries of consumer reviews.

"Traditional approaches to managing customer churn have typically concentrated on those customers most likely to defect. While accurately predicting customer churn probability is important, this metric alone does not sufficiently empower managers to make optimal decisions. Hence, the current study focuses on the relationship between retention incentives and profit maximisation. Specifically, we improve existing churn management practices by: (1) allowing for customer heterogeneity in incentive redemption behaviour, (2) introducing the dependence of the probability of accepting an incentive on its monetary value, and (3) offering an improved model for developing retention campaigns.

"While data mining is well established in practice, opinion mining is still in its infancy, with issues in particular around the development of methodologies which effectively extract accurate, reliable, influential and useful information from the raw opinion data collected from informal product reviews. Current approaches adopt a single-variable approach, focusing on individual metrics-word length, the presence of keywords, or the overall semantic orientation of terms within the data-while neglecting to evaluate whether these individual artifacts are indicative of the tone of a given review. This approach has significant limitations when we move from trying to merely evaluate whether an online opinion is positive or negative, to trying to evaluate how likely it is that the opinion will influence others. Given this issue, one promising avenue would be to evaluate the general analysis approaches utilized by opinion mining algorithms and identified in the literature in terms of how accurately they reflect how people actually interpret and are influenced by electronic online reviews. Through interviewing and a follow up survey of 136 participants, the validity of the approach in terms of ascertaining the tone of a piece of text can be evaluated, as well as the identification of measurable factors within text which make a given opinionated text more or less influential in an online context, further facilitating the development of more effective multivariate opinion mining approaches.

"The telecommunication company functioned in the market with extremely high competitiveness. Attracting new customers needs 5-10 times more expenses than maintaining an existing one. As a result, effective customer churn management and analysis of the reasons for customer churn are vital tasks for telecommunication operators. As a result, predicting subscriber churn by switching on the competitors becomes very important. Data Science and machine learning create enormous opportunities for solving this task to evaluate customer satisfaction with company services, determine factors that cause disappointment, and forecast which clients are at a greater risk of abandoning and changing services suppliers. A company that implements data analysis and modelling to develop customer churn prediction models has an opportunity to improve customer churn management and increase business results. The purposes of the research are the application of machine learning models for a telecommunications company, in particular, the construction of models for predicting the user churn rate and proving that Data Science models and machine learning are high-quality and effective tools for solving the tasks of forecasting the key marketing metrics of a telecommunications company. Based on the example of Telco, the article contains the results of the implementation of various models for classification, such as logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, using Python programming language. All models are characterised by high quality (the general accuracy is over 80%). So, the paper demonstrates the feasibility and possibility of implementing the model to classify customers in the future to anticipate subscriber churn (clients who may abandon the company's services) and minimise consumer outflow based on this. The main factors influencing customer churn are established, which is basic information for further forecasting client outflow. Customer outflow prediction models implementation will help to reduce customer churn and maintain their loyalty. The research results can be useful for optimising marketing activity of managing the outflow of consumers of companies on the telecommunication market by developing effective decisions based on data and improving the mathematical methodology of forecasting the outflow of consumers.

"This study provides a formal analysis of the customer targeting problem when the cost for a marketing action depends on the customer response and proposes a framework to estimate the decision variables for campaign profit optimization. Targeting a customer is profitable if the impact and associated profit of the marketing treatment are higher than its cost. Despite the growing literature on uplift models to iden-tify the strongest treatment-responders, no research has investigated optimal targeting when the costs of the treatment are unknown at the time of the targeting decision. Stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct marketing and customer retention campaigns because marketing incentives are conditioned on a positive customer response. This study makes two contributions to the literature, which are evaluated on an e-commerce coupon targeting campaign. First, we formally analyze the targeting decision problem under response-dependent costs. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the treatment effect on the customer and an estimate of the customer response probability under treatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the consideration of treatment cost substantially increases campaign profit when used for customer targeting in combination with an estimate of the average or customer-level treatment effect. Second, we propose a framework to jointly estimate the treatment effect and the response probability by combining methods for causal inference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle model achieves competitive campaign profit while streamlining model building. All codes are available at https://github.com/Humboldt- WI/response- dependent-costs .

"This paper proposes an elegant way of estimating retail productivity through a mathematical model inspired by FGLS multivariate linear regression, using the error equation obtained as a hidden variable estimator to be used as inferred efficiency. This methodology was applied to a dataset obtained from a leading ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) manufacturer and demonstrated substantial results. Unlike conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, the proposed approach offers benchmarking information relative to the best-performing retailers, as opposed to the typical relative-to-average outcomes of regressions. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA), this methodology relies on the entire dataset to establish the efficiency index, thereby addressing limitations imposed by DEA and allowing for executive discretion and flexibility in the analysis.","Fix, R; Pecora, JE; da Veiga, CP",Tactical,10.7769/gesec.v14i8.2496,Marketing Channels; Retail Productivity; Data Science; Feasible Generalized Least Squares,5.0,,15,5,SINDICATO SECRETARIAS ESTADO SAO PAULO,"The paper discusses a methodology for estimating retail productivity that is practical and structured, focusing on the application of a mathematical model to inform decision-making in retail contexts.

"Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. Whereas these tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, we reframe them as an explicit trade-off between the opportunity cost of the test (where some customers receive a suboptimal treatment) and the potential losses associated with deploying a suboptimal treatment to the remainder of the population. We derive a closed-form expression for the profit-maximizing test size and show that it is substantially smaller than typically recommended for a hypothesis test, particularly when the response is noisy or when the total population is small. The common practice of using small holdout groups can be rationalized by asymmetric priors. The proposed test design achieves nearly the same expected regret as the flexible yet harder-to-implement multi-armed bandit under a wide range of conditions. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in three different marketing contexts-website design, display advertising, and catalog tests-in which we estimate priors from past data. In all three cases, the optimal sample sizes are substantially smaller than for a traditional hypothesis test, resulting in higher profit.","Feit, EM; Berman, R",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2019.1194,A/B testing; randomized controlled trial; marketing experiments; Bayesian decision theory; sample size,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a method for optimizing A/B testing in marketing, focusing on the practical implementation of testing strategies and sample sizes to maximize profits.

"When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the winning model before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the legwork of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e. g., the back-and-forth migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e. g., the inclusion of an off state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general recipe for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework).","Schwartz, EM; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2013.0825,model selection; machine learning; data science; business intelligence; hidden Markov models; classification tree; random forest; posterior predictive model checking; hierarchical Bayesian methods; forecasting,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses decision-making tools for selecting statistical models based on data characteristics, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and forecasting.",wos-data science,10,70,Model Selection Using Database Characteristics: Developing a Classification Tree for Longitudinal Incidence Data,2014
"Targeted digital advertising (TDA) is immensely popular among marketing practitioners; investigating its effects is increasingly becoming a subject of academic research. Brands can push advertisements of the same product from different sources to consumers in a targeted manner; however, the differences in the impact on consumers of TDA with different content sources are surprisingly understudied. Therefore, this study analyzes the consumers' purchase intentions in the context of TDA with different content sources (stars vs. bloggers vs. top e-commerce streamers), and the perceived differences between consumers with different thinking styles. Through two experimental studies, this study finds that TDA with top e-commerce streamers' recommendation source can better improve consumers' purchase intentions more than TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with a blogger evaluation. For consumers who prefer the rational thinking style, TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better; For consumers who prefer the empirical thinking style, TDA recommended by bloggers and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better. Furthermore, this study finds that consumers' mental simulation and perceived usefulness can mediate the relationships described above, and that the two play a chain mediation role. The findings contribute to the precision marketing literature by enriching the understanding of the psychological mechanism underlying consumers' perceptions of and decision factors toward the TDA.","Han, Z; Du, G",Tactical,10.1002/cb.2230,,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The study analyzes consumer purchase intentions based on different targeted digital advertising strategies, which aligns with tactical decisions such as campaign automation and advanced targeting.

"House Of Quality (HOQ) is one of the matrices of an iterative process called Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The foundation of the HOQ is the belief that products should be designed to reflect customers' desires and taste. HOQ is performed by a multidisciplinary team representing marketing, design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and any other functions considered critical by the company. In general, it provides a framework in which all participants can communicate their thoughts about a product. More specifically, HOQ is often used to identify the relationships between requirements based on different viewpoints. There are two issues in analyzing these requirements using HOQ. First, requirements are often described informally using vague terms. However, lack of formal way in interpreting the semantics of these requirements makes it difficult to determine if a realization of the system meets its customer's needs. Second, identifying relationships between requirements is often time consuming. Sometimes, it is difficult to arrive at a group consensus on a particular relationship between requirements. To address these issues, we have developed a fuzzy logic-based extension to HOQ for capturing imprecise requirements to both facilitate communication of team members and have a formal representation of requirements. Based on this representation, we developed a heuristic inference scheme to reason about the implicit relationships between requirements. We illustrate our approach using a textile mill supply business application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Supplier segmentation means that the suppliers of a specific firm are categorized on the basis of their similarities. This supply-side business-to-business (B2B) segmentation is of special importance to companies with many suppliers. Supplier segmentation yields a manageable number of segments, each of which requires a separate strategy. Standard supplier segmentation methods have serious shortcomings, for instance because they fail to make a proper connection between supplier segmentation and other supplier-related activities such as supplier selection and development. Moreover, these standard methods typically use a limited number of segmentation criteria and different sets of criteria are suggested for each method. It is unclear for practitioners how to choose a particular method. The purpose of this paper is to form a practical tool for supplier segmentation taking into account all suggested segmentation criteria. The principal result of this paper is the design of a rule-based method to segment the suppliers of a firm based on two overarching dimensions: supplier capabilities and supplier willingness. The method is applied to a real-world situation to show how the results can be used in practice. A general sensitivity analysis procedure for fuzzy rule-based systems is proposed and then implemented, to identify the most important supplier capabilities and willingness criteria and to formulate better supplier development strategies. A major conclusion of the paper is that the fuzzy logic approach to supplier segmentation is simple to apply in practice, yet considers all available segmentation criteria and their inherent fuzziness in a way that is easily adaptable to a specific industrial context.

"PurposeThis study examines the effect of social media marketing on voting intention applying a combination of fuzzy logic methodology and a multidimensional panel data model.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopts a multidimensional panel data method that includes several fixed effects. The dependent variable is a multifaceted construct that measures the participants' intention to vote. The independent variables are electronic word of mouth (eWOM), customisation (CUS), entertainment (ENT), interaction (INT), trendiness (TRD), candidate's perceived image (CPI), religious beliefs (RB), gender and age. The grouping variables that signify fixed effects are employment status, level of education, mostly used social media and religion. First, the significance of said fixed effects was tested through an ANOVA process. Then, the main model was estimated, including the significant grouping variables as fixed effects.FindingsEmployment status and level of education were significant fixed effects. Also, eWOM, ENT, INT, CPI, RB and gender significantly affected participants' voting intention.Research limitations/implicationsBeing based on a questionnaire that asked participants about how they perceive different aspects of social media, the present study is limited to their perceptions. Therefore, further studies covering the voters' behaviour in action could be efficient complements to the present study.Practical implicationsThe findings could guide the political parties into prioritizing the aspects of social media in forming an effective campaign resulting in being elected.Social implicationsThe findings have the potential to help the public in making better informed decisions when voting. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate applications for social media which are beyond leisure time fillers.Originality/valueFuzzy logic and multidimensional panel data estimates are this study's novelty and originality.

"Designing a successful product line is a critical decision for a firm to stay competitive. By offering a line of products, the manufacturer can maximize profits or market share through satisfying more consumers than a single product would. The optimal Product Line Design (PLD) problem is classified as NP-hard. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Self-Tuning Differential Evolution (FSTDE) for PLD, which exploits Fuzzy Logic to automatically calculate the parameters independently for each solution during the optimization, thus resulting to a settings-free version of DE. The proposed method is compared to the most successful mutation strategies of the algorithm as well as previous approaches to the PLD problem, like Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, using both actual and artificial data of consumer preferences. The comparison results demonstrate that FSTDE is an attractive alternative approach to the PLD problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"User-generated content (UGC) is influential in reducing customer perceived risk and determining online store sales. E-sellers spend huge costs and efforts to improve UGC for it serves as a convenient and persuasive alternative for marketing and advertising purposes. Considering that consumers may set lower and/or upper limits (i.e., psychological thresholds) in which the good is expected to be, and purchase decisions are considered as a multi-stage decision process, yet models in previous research cannot uncover this decision-making process. Therefore, exploring the impact of UGC at each decision-making stage and detecting the psychological thresholds on various aspects of UGC (i.e., the fine-grained effects of UGC) contribute to optimizing the UGC with the best cost to boost sales. To this end, a fine-grained joint two-stage decision model, zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB-P) model is proposed to support economical UGC marketing. Specifically, we compile a factors system composed of various types of aggregate-level statistics of UGC, which can impact risk perception. Afterward, change point analysis is used to find multi-level consumer psychological thresholds on UGC factors and consumers' risk perception model is constructed to measure purchasing probabilities in the first decision-making stage. On the basis of consumers' risk perception model, the ZINB-P model is built to fully capture the fine-grained effects of UGC factors on each stage of the consumer purchase decision. It integrates two stages of consumer decision: the consumer risk perception and non-compensatory choice in the first stage, and the second compensatory stage. A genetic algorithm is constructed to jointly estimate the parameters in ZINB-P model. Finally, an experiment on a kind of fresh produce from Taobao.com evidences the precision of our model. We demonstrate how our model can provide with economical UGC marketing strategies using a decision support table, in which some scenarios are identified. E-sellers can use this table to find the scenarios they are located in and identify the critical UGC factors that impede the sales in each scenario, and thus economical UGC marketing strategies can be obtained by improving these critical UGC factors.","Li, SG; Zhang, YQ; Yu, ZX; Liu, F",Tactical,10.1007/s10660-020-09401-8,Perceived risk; Purchase decision process; Psychological threshold; Fine-grained joint model; ZINB-P model,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a model for optimizing user-generated content (UGC) to enhance sales, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Accounting for social network effects in marketing strategies has become an important issue. Taking a step back, we seek to incorporate and analyze social network effects on new product development and then propose a model to engineer product diffusion over a social network. We build upon the share-of-choice (SOC) problem, which is a strategic combinatorial optimization problem used commonly as one of the methods to analyze conjoint analysis data by marketers in order to identify a product with largest market share, and show how to incorporate social network effects in the SOC problem. We construct a genetic algorithm to solve this computationally challenging (NP-Hard) problem and show that ignoring social network effects in the design phase results in a significantly lower market share for a product. In this setting, we introduce the secondary operational problem of determining the least expensive way of influencing individuals and strengthening product diffusion over a social network.

"Many real life ill-structured problems involve high uncertainty and complexity preventing application of analytical optimization techniques in building effective decision support systems (DSS). These systems may employ simulation method and search for a good solution through what-if analysis. However, this method is very time consuming and often overlooks the consideration of many promising alternative solutions. A genetic algorithm (GA) automates the search for good solutions by finding near-optimal solutions and increases effectiveness of DSS. This paper introduces a hybrid method based on the combination of Monte-Carlo simulation and genetic algorithms. The combined method is illustrated through application to the marketing mix problem to improve the process for searching and evaluating alternatives for decisional support. The paper compares two methods: MC and MC + GA. It also discusses ways for dealing with crisp and soft constraints contained in the example problem. A business game environment is chosen for experiments. The results of the experiments show that the GA-based approach outperforms human what-if method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

"Content platforms (e.g., newspapers, magazines) post several stories daily on their dedicated social media pages and promote some of them using targeted content advertising (TCA). Posting stories enables content platforms to grow their social media audiences and generate digital advertising revenue from the impressions channeled through social media posts' link clicks. However, optimal scheduling of social media posts and TCA is formidable, requiring content platforms to determine what to post; when to post; and whether, when, and how much to spend on TCA to maximize profits. Social media managers lament this complexity, and academic literature offers little guidance. Consequently, the authors draw from literature on circadian rhythms in information processing capabilities to build a novel theoretical framework on social media content scheduling and explain how scheduling attributes (i.e., time of day, content type, and TCA) affect the link clicks metric. They test their hypotheses using a model estimated on 366 days of Facebook post data from a top 50 U.S. newspaper. Subsequently, they build an algorithm that allows social media managers to optimally plan social media content schedules and maximize gross profits.

The manufacturer procures raw materials from multiple suppliers to produce a family of products sold to multiple retailers. Multiple types of products are substitutable each other to end customers. The manufacturer makes its decision on raw materials' procurement, platform product configuration, product replenishment policies to retailers with VMI, price discount rate, and advertising investment to maximize its profit. Retailers in turn consider the optimal local advertising investments and retail prices to maximize their profits. This problem is modeled as a dual simultaneous non-cooperative game (as a dual Nash game) model with two sub-games. One is between the retailers serving in competing retail markets and the other is between the manufacturer and the retailers. This paper combines analytical, iterative and GA (genetic algorithm) methods to develop a game solution algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium. A numerical example is conducted to test the proposed model and algorithm, and gain managerial implications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Cluster-based segmentation usually involves two sets of variables: (i) the needs-based variables (referred to as the bases variables), which are used in developing the original segments to identify the value, and (ii) the classification or background variables, which are used to profile or target the customers. The managers goal is to utilize these two sets of variables in the most efficient manner. Pragmatic managerial interests recognize the underlying need to start shifting from methodologies that obtain highly precise value-based segments but may be of limited practical use as they provide less targetable segments. Consequently, the imperative is to shift toward newer segmentation approaches that provide greater focus on targetable segments while maintaining homogeneity. This requires dual objective segmentation, which is a combinatorially difficult problem. Hence, we propose and examine a new evolutionary methodology based on genetic algorithms to address this problem. We show, based on a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation and a case study, that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the existing methods for a wide variety of problem instances. We are able to obtain statistically significant and managerially important improvements in targetability with little diminution in the identifiability of value-based segments. Moreover, the proposed methodology provides a set of good solutions, unlike existing methodologies that provide a single solution. We also show how these good solutions can be used to plot an efficient Pareto frontier. Finally, we present useful insights that would help managers in implementing the proposed solution approach effectively.","Balakrishnan, PV; Kumar, S; Han, P",Tactical,10.1111/j.1540-5915.2011.00333.x,Cluster Analysis; Dual Objective; Genetic Algorithms; Hybrid Heuristics; Marketing; Pareto-Frontier; and Segmentation,5.0,,5,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses methodologies for segmenting customers based on needs and targeting, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"In addition to retailing new vehicles, automotive manufacturers in the United States sell millions of vehicles through leasing and to fleet customers every year. The majority of these vehicles are returned to the automotive manufacturers at the end of the contracted term and must be remarketed. In 2007, about 10 million used vehicles were sold at more than 400 auctions in the United States. Large consigners face decisions every day about when, where, and at what price to offer these vehicles, which has significant financial implications for their profitability. To address the challenges of the distribution process, Power Information Network (PIN), a division of J.D. Power and Associates, developed the PIN Optimal Distribution of Auction Vehicles System (ODAV), an automated decision optimization system that helps remarketers maximize profits through the most advantageous distribution of their auction vehicles. At the core of the system is a combination of three models that determine the distribution of the vehicles on a daily basis: a nearest neighbor linear regression model for short-term auction price forecasting; an autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis model for volume-price elasticity; and a genetic algorithm optimizer for vehicle distribution. Since its launch in 2003, PIN has been providing ODAV services on a daily basis, and to date, more than two million vehicles have been distributed through this system. In this paper, we will describe the PIN ODAV System, its implementation, and the business impact by using as an example the experience with our largest client, Chrysler Group LLC.","Du, J; Xie, LL; Schroeder, S",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1080.0470,used vehicle; auction price; distribution; forecasting; optimization,5.0,,20,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the implementation of an automated decision optimization system designed to maximize profits through the distribution of auction vehicles.

"Optimization path is a complicated issue to manage the manufacture and distribution of fresh food, influenced by several parameters, such as its perishability. Producers cannot ensure that manufacturing and distribution decisions will be efficient and accurate. Using 15 prefecture-level cities in China as a case study, this paper gathers and organizes relevant data indicators of rural economy and agricultural ecological environment economic recovery for the period between 2008 and 2020, builds the composite evaluation index, determines the development index using the reporting system function, and finally employs a novel digital evaluation scheme to assess the coupling and coordination between the cities over time. The following inferences are made. To begin, linear growth with uneven regional development may be seen in the rural economy's complete level index (values from 0.422 to 0.622). The objective of the study is to address the two-stage collaborative planning challenge to maximize farmer income by promoting the economic recovery. This article offers a mixed-integer processing paradigm to account for these restrictions. Calculations show that the suggested collaborative planning model may increase farmers' distributing revenue by 7.98% compared to the existing independent decision-making distribution channel. Management thoughts have been developed based on various decision scenarios. Agricultural producers must sort and bundle their products with care and work with a fast and reliable delivery business and on time to deliver their items.

"This paper aims to discuss the adoption of information technology by retailers in Jordan and the impact on retail space, particularly in major urban areas of Jordan. Retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, and Metro are using advanced technologies to continue attracting and expanding consumers with the advent of internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID) and point of sales (POS) hardware and software and retail. The study relied on the explanatory approach to achieve these objectives. The study sample consisted of 134 stores that were chosen randomly and 480 customers of these stores, which were also chosen randomly. A questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and distributed among the respondents. The statistical analysis program (SPSS) was used to analyze the data obtained from the sample and test the hypotheses. The study results showed that information technologies influence customer perceptions. However, RFID appears to have no impact on employee perception. Retailers' attitudes and adoption of information technologies in the Jordanian retail sector are heavily influenced by external factors. RFID usage does not play a significant role in determining the retailers' attitude towards adopting IT practices. The reason for such an outcome may be that sometimes the devices fail to read the various codes, and thus, it makes it difficult for the retailer to scan the products.","Alomari, KM",Tactical,10.21511/im.18(1).2022.04,IT practices; retail sector; employee perspective; customer perspective,5.0,,15,0,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,"The study discusses the adoption of information technology by retailers and its impact on customer perceptions and retail practices, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into specific targets and actions.",wos-Internet of Things,10,70,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRACTICES IN THE JORDANIAN RETAIL SECTOR: EMPLOYEE AND CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE,2022
"Purpose - This paper aims to analyze and model consumer behavior on hotel online search interest in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - Discrete Fourier transform was used to analyze the periodicity of hotel search behavior in the USA by using Google Trends data. Based on the obtained frequency components, a model structure was proposed to describe the search interest. A separable nonlinear least squares algorithm was developed to fit the data. Findings - It was found that the major dynamics of the search interest was composed of nine frequency components. The developed separable nonlinear least squares algorithm significantly reduced the number of model parameters that needed to be estimated. The fitting results indicated that the model structure could fit the data well (average error 0.575 per cent).

"Hydrogen-powered vehicles or fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) are recognized as one of the leading innovations within sustainable technologies. However, to the best of our knowledge, only few studies have been conducted regarding the consumer's perspective of the product. This study focuses on analyzing the consumer's criteria and level behind their behavior regarding these vehicles to identify consumer segments that can be potential innovators and early adopters of FCEV. The K-means clustering method was employed to identify different consumer segments based on their chosen criteria. Next, consumer characteristics and their preferences were analyzed using a multinomial logit model to derive important marketing and policy implications. The result of the analysis indicates that 44.9% of the consumers consider FCEV as a potential alternative. These consumers consist of Innovative luxury consumer group (6.2%), Advanced eco-friendly consumer group (12.6%), and Economy-oriented eco-friendly consumer group (26.1%). Among the three groups, the innovative and luxurious consumer group, who considered all traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles with FCEV, had the highest potential to leapfrog to FCEV.

"Purpose - This paper explores various supervised ma-chine learning algorithms as an additional classification method to RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) mod-els with the aim of improving the accuracy in predicting target groups of customers for direct marketing response campaigns conducted by a casino. The purpose of this paper is twofold - first, to test how the addition of demo-graphic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach - Our research em-ployed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino's direct marketing activi-ties to improve the company's RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications - The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company's own RFM seg-mentation was also found to perform well.Limitations - Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models' power.

"Purpose There is a strong prerequisite for organizations to analyze customer review behavior to evaluate the competitive business environment. The purpose of this study is to analyze and predict customer reviews of halal restaurants using machine learning (ML) approaches. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected customer review data from the Yelp website. The authors filtered the reviews of only halal restaurants from the original data set. Following cleaning, the filtered review texts were classified as positive, neutral or negative sentiments, and those sentiments were scored using the AFINN and VADER sentiment algorithms. Also, the current study applies four machine learning methods to classify each review toward halal restaurants into its sentiment class. Findings The experiment showed that most of the customer reviews toward halal restaurants were positive. The authors also discovered that all of the methods (decision tree, linear support vector machine, logistic regression and random forest classifier) can correctly classify the review text into sentiment class, but logistic regression outperforms the others in terms of accuracy.

"Predicting future customer behavior provides key information for efficiently directing resources at sales and marketing departments. Such information supports planning the inventory at the warehouse and point of sales, as well strategic decisions during manufacturing processes. In this paper, we develop advanced analytics tools that predict future customer behavior in the non-contractual setting. We establish a dynamic and data driven framework for predicting whether a customer is going to make purchase at the company within a certain time frame in the near future. For that purpose, we propose a new set of customer relevant features that derives from times and values of previous purchases. These customer features are updated every month, and state of the art machine learning algorithms are applied for purchase prediction. In our studies, the gradient tree boosting method turns out to be the best performing method.

"In B2B markets, value-based pricing and selling has become an important alternative to discounting. This study outlines a modeling method that uses customer data (product offers made to each current or potential customer, features, discounts, and customer purchase decisions) to estimate a mixed logit choice model. The model is estimated via hierarchical Bayes and machine learning, delivering customer-level parameter estimates. Customer-level estimates are input into a nonlinear programming next-offer maximization problem to select optimal features and discount level for customer segments, where segments are based on loyalty and discount elasticity. The mixed logit model is integrated with economic theory (the random utility model), and it predicts both customer perceived value for and response to alternative future sales offers. The methodology can be implemented to support value-based pricing and selling efforts. Contributions to the literature include: (a) the use of customer-level parameter estimates from a mixed logit model, delivered via a hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure, to support value-based pricing decisions; (b) validation that mixed logit customer-level modeling can deliver strong predictive accuracy, not as high as random forest but comparing favorably; and (c) a nonlinear programming problem that uses customer-level mixed logit estimates to select optimal features and discounts.","Colias, JV; Park, S; Horn, E",Tactical,10.1057/s41270-021-00113-y,B2B; Sales data; Machine learning; Mixed logit; Nonlinear programming,5.0,,15,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,"The abstract discusses a modeling method for estimating customer-level parameters to support value-based pricing and selling efforts, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",wos-machine learning,20,60,"Optimizing B2B product offers with machine learning, mixed logit, and nonlinear programming",2021
"Uplift models support decision-making in marketing campaign planning. Estimating the causal effect of a marketing treatment, an uplift model facilitates targeting marketing actions to responsive customers and efficient allocation of marketing budget. Research into uplift models focuses on conversion models to maximize incremental sales. The paper introduces uplift models for maximizing incremental revenues. If customers differ in their spending behavior, revenue maximization is a more plausible business objective compared to maximizing conversions. The proposed methodology entails a transformation of the prediction target, customer-level revenues, that facilitates implementing a causal uplift model using standard machine learning algorithms. The distribution of campaign revenues is typically zero-inflated because of many non-buyers. Remedies to this modeling challenge are incorporated in the proposed revenue uplift strategies in the form of two-stage models. Empirical experiments using real-world e-commerce data confirm the merits of the proposed revenue uplift strategy over relevant alternatives, including uplift models for conversion and recently developed causal machine learning algorithms. To quantify the degree to which improved targeting decisions raise return on marketing, the paper develops a decomposition of campaign profit. Applying the decomposition to a digital coupon targeting campaign, the paper provides evidence that revenue uplift modeling, as well as causal machine learning, can improve campaign profit substantially.

"Budgeting and planning processes require medium-term sales forecasts with marketing scenarios. The complexity in modern retailing necessitates consistent, automatic forecasting and insight generation. Remedies to the high dimensionality problem have drawbacks; black box machine learning methods require voluminous data and lack insights, while regularization may bias causal estimates in interpretable models. The proposed FAIR (Fully Automatic Interpretable Retail forecasting) method supports the retail planning process with multi-step-ahead category-store level forecasts, scenario evaluations, and insights. It considers category-store specific seasonality, focaland cross-category marketing, and adaptive base sales while dealing with regularization-induced confounding. We show, with three chains from the IRI dataset involving 30 categories, that regularization-induced confounding decreases forecast accuracy. By including focal- and cross-category marketing, as well as random disturbances, forecast accuracy is increased. FAIR is more accurate than the black box machine learning method Boosted Trees and other benchmarks while also providing insights that are in line with the marketing literature.

"Today's Internet marketing ecosystems are very complex, with many competing players, transactions concluded within milliseconds, and hundreds of different parameters to be analyzed in the decision-making process. In addition, both sellers and buyers operate under uncertainty, without full information about auction results, purchasing preferences, and strategies of their competitors or suppliers. As a result, most market participants strive to optimize their trading strategies using advanced machine learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a new approach to determining reserve-price strategies for publishers, focusing not only on the profits from individual ad impressions, but also on maximum coverage of advertising space. This strategy combines the heuristics developed by experienced RTB consultants with machine learning forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet. The paper analyses the effectiveness of these algorithms, recommends the best one, and presents its implementation in real environment. As such, its results may form a basis for a competitive advantage for publishers on very demanding online advertising markets.","Wodecki, A",Tactical,10.2478/fman-2020-0013,online marketing; real-time bidding; reserve price optimization; machine learning; forecasting,5.0,,10,0,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses optimizing trading strategies using machine learning algorithms to determine reserve-price strategies for publishers, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets.",wos-machine learning,15,70,THE RESERVE PRICE OPTIMIZATION FOR PUBLISHERS ON REAL-TIME BIDDING ON-LINE MARKETPLACES WITH TIME-SERIES FORECASTING,2020
"The authors test methods, based on cognitively simple decision rules, that predict which products consumers select for their consideration sets. Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles. The article closes with an illustration of how DOC-based rules can affect managerial decisions.","Hauser, JR; Toubia, O; Evgeniou, T; Befurt, R; Dzyabura, D",Tactical,10.1509/jmkr.47.3.485,consideration sets; noncompensatory decisions; consumer heuristics; machine learning; conjoint analysis; cognitive simplicity; lexicography; decision theory,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses methods for predicting consumer selection of products based on decision rules, which aligns with structured decision-making processes typically found at the tactical level.

"Unlike brick-and-mortar stores where consumers can use all of their senses to examine a product, online retailers must properly present products to shoppers via a computer-mediated interface. In this exploratory study, we investigate how the brain makes purchase decisions when it encounters different types of visual presentation strategies. Specifically, we use event-related fMRI to study brain activation preceding purchase decisions under three visual presentation strategies: (1) static picture, (2) image zooming, and (3) rotation video. Twenty-four (24) participants made 60 apparel purchase decisions. Utilizing machine learning, we study whether and how various neural circuits are engaged in purchase decision-making in regard to different types of visual sensory information. The functional neuroimaging results suggest high accuracy (highest: 95%, Rotation condition) in predicting purchase decisions using brain activity in the product evaluation process. Furthermore, cross-category validation reveals the activation patterns under the Rotation condition most successfully predict choices across the other two presentation conditions: this suggests a potential universal brain activity pattern in these apparel purchase decisions. Finally, we found some brain regions (such as the cerebellum) that are less likely to be associated with purchase decisions but are considered influential in predicting online apparel purchase decisions in the context of watching a rotation product video. The cerebellar activation may suggest association with spatial cognition and virtual navigation in addition to motor control. This study contributes to the research field of NeuroIS and online shopper study. The results provide empirical evidence to support the refined S-O-R theoretical model Jacoby (2002) and heuristic information process and inform the practical implications of sensory-engaging presentations in helping consumers to make online purchase decisions.

"People's shopping habits are changing because of live streaming as a new business context. Based on this context, this study explores the effect of influencer happiness intensity on audience purchasing using the hard archival data from TikTok, the world's top live-streaming app in terms of downloads. The influencers' facial happiness intensity, attractiveness score, and visual attributions of the live streaming room were extracted from the videos using a machine learning method, and the estimation model was built. The findings indicate an inverted U-shape relationship between influencer happiness intensity and audience purchase, with accessories having the highest sales volume and an influence happiness intensity of 0.43. The additional propensity score matching test provides causal evidence for the negative impact of influencers' happiness intensity on sales volume after exceeding the peak intensity, which is the subject of this paper. Furthermore, we investigate the probable underlying mechanism of the influencer-audience interaction. It demonstrates that the danmaku quantity and quality will have a partial mediation effect in the process of influencer happiness intensity influencing sales volume.

"Consumers' preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model.","Chen, YP; Iyengar, R; Iyengar, G",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.0992,sparse machine learning; multimodal continuous heterogeneity; conjoint analysis,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a modeling approach for consumer preferences that is applied to conjoint analysis, which is a tactical decision-making tool used to derive insights for marketing strategies and optimize decisions based on consumer heterogeneity.",wos-machine learning,10,70,Modeling Multimodal Continuous Heterogeneity in Conjoint Analysis-A Sparse Learning Approach,2017
"Retail media is of growing interest to brands, and online retailers offer a large collection of product information that is freely available for consumers' online and offline purchase decisions. In this study, the authors map webrooming across ten product categories by combining internal data from consumer browsing behavior at an online retailer and survey responses from the same customers about their offsite behavior. Moreover, they build a random forest machine-learning model to predict the magnitude of webrooming across categories. They find that webrooming is economically substantial. On average, for every 10 customers who research the product category on-site and buy on-site, 17 other customers research the product category on-site and buy off-site. As to retail media's impact, upper-funnel and always-on online ad forms are associated with a higher number of online searchers in the laptop category who buy the brand offline.

"In this paper, we propose a unified dynamic framework for adaptive ad sequencing that optimizes user engagement with ads. Our framework comprises three components: (1) a Markov decision process that incorporates intertemporal tradeoffs in ad interventions, (2) an empirical framework that combines machine learning methods with insights from causal inference to achieve personalization, counterfactual validity, and scalability, and (3) a robust policy evaluation method. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that the dynamic policy generated by our framework improves the current practice in the industry by 5.76%. This improvement almost entirely comes from the increased average ad response to each impression instead of the increased usage by each user. We further document a U-shaped pattern in improvements across the length of the user's history, with high values when the user is new or when enough data are available for the user. Next, we show that ad diversity is higher under our policy and explore the reason behind it. We conclude by discussing the implications and broad applicability of our framework to settings where a platform wants to sequence content to optimize user engagement.","Rafieian, O",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2022.1423,advertising; personalization; adaptive interventions; policy evaluation; dynamic programming; machine learning; offline reinforcement learning,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses optimizing user engagement with ads through a dynamic framework that includes components like ad sequencing, machine learning methods, and policy evaluation.

"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known learn-and-earn trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser's MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel.","Schwartz, EM; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.1023,multi-armed bandit; online advertising; field experiments; A/B testing; adaptive experiments; sequential decision making; explore-exploit; earning-and-learning; reinforcement learning; hierarchical models; machine learning,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the optimization of ad impressions and customer acquisition strategies, which are aligned with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Pricing managers at online retailers face a unique challenge. They must decide on real-time prices for a large number of products with incomplete demand information. The manager runs price experiments to learn about each product's demand curve and the profitmaximizing price. In practice, balanced field price experiments can create high opportunity costs, because a large number of customers are presented with suboptimal prices. In this paper, we propose an alternative dynamic price experimentation policy. The proposed approach extends multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms from statistical machine learning to include microeconomic choice theory. Our automated pricing policy solves this MAB problem using a scalable distribution-free algorithm. We prove analytically that our method is asymptotically optimal for any weakly downward sloping demand curve. In a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared with balanced field experiments and standard methods in dynamic pricing from computer science. In a calibrated simulation based on an existing pricing field experiment, we find that our algorithm can increase profits by 43% during the month of testing and 4% annually.","Misra, K; Schwartz, EM; Abernethy, J",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2018.1129,dynamic pricing; e-commerce; online experiments; machine learning; multiarmed bandits; partial identification; minimax regret; nonparametric econometrics; A/B testing; field experiments,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes a dynamic pricing experimentation policy that utilizes algorithms to optimize pricing decisions based on real-time data and demand information.

"Despite the growth of online retail, the majority of products are still sold offline, and the touch-and-feel aspect of physically examining a product before purchase remains important to many consumers. In this paper, we demonstrate that large discrepancies can exist between how consumers evaluate products when examining them live versus based on online descriptions, even for a relatively familiar product (messenger bags) and for utilitarian features. Therefore, the use of online evaluations in market research may result in inaccurate predictions and potentially suboptimal decisions by the firm. Because eliciting preferences by conducting large-scale offline market research is costly, we propose fusing data from a large online study with data from a smaller set of participants who complete both an online and an offline study. We demonstrate our approach using conjoint studies on two sets of participants. The group who completed both online and offline studies allows us to calibrate the relationship between online and offline partworths. To obtain reliable parameter estimates, we propose two statistical methods: a hierarchical Bayesian approach and a k-nearest-neighbors approach. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better out-of-sample predictive performance on individual choices (up to 25% improvement), as well as aggregate market shares (up to 33% improvement).","Dzyabura, D; Jagabathula, S; Muller, E",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2018.1124,conjoint analysis; omnichannel; machine learning; Bayesian; consumer choice,5.0,,25,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses methods for improving market research predictions using a combination of online and offline data, which aligns with structured decision-making and optimization processes in marketing analytics.",wos-machine learning,10,60,Accounting for Discrepancies Between Online and Offline Product Evaluations,2019

In Study 2 we explore how a voice retailer could use the potential capability to predict customer mood. Our results provide evidence that a customer's good mood is associated with purchases of higher-priced premium brands. In addition, retailers can use mood prediction to adapt the presentation of product information to fit customer mood, thus helping customers optimize their decisions.

"The study of brand choice decisions with multiple alternatives has been successfully modelled for more than a decade using the Multinomial Legit model. Recently, neural network modelling has received increasing attention and has been applied to an array of marketing problems such as market response or segmentation. We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Legit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Legit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Legit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics. The method is illustrated on an artificial dataset where the market is heterogeneous. We then apply the approach to panel scanner data of purchase records, using the Legit to analyse the non-linearities detected by the neural network.

"This paper presents a definitive description of neural network methodology and provides an evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages relative to statistical procedures. The development of this rich class of models was inspired by the neural architecture of the human brain. These models mathematically emulate the neurophysical structure and decision making of the human brain, and, from a statistical perspective, are closely related to generalized linear models. Artificial neural networks are, however, nonlinear and use a different estimation procedure (feed forward and back propagation) than is used in traditional statistical models (least squares or maximum likelihood). Additionally, neural network models do not require the same restrictive assumptions about the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable(s). Consequently, these models have already been very successfully applied in many diverse disciplines, including biology, psychology, statistics, mathematics, business, insurance, and computer science. We propose that neural networks will prove to be a valuable tool for marketers concerned with predicting consumer choice. We will demonstrate that neural networks provide superior predictions regarding consumer decision processes. In the context of modeling consumer judgment and decision making, for example, neural network models can offer significant improvement over traditional statistical methods because of their ability to capture nonlinear relationships associated with the use of noncompensatory decision rules. Our analysis reveals that neural networks have great potential for improving model predictions in nonlinear decision contexts without sacrificing performance in linear decision contexts. This paper provides a detailed introduction to neural networks that is understandable to both the academic researcher and the practitioner. This exposition is intended to provide both the intuition and the rigorous mathematical models needed for successful applications. In particular, a step-by-step outline of: how to use the models is provided along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the model. We also address the robustness of the neural network models and discuss how far wrong you might go using neural network models versus traditional statistical methods. Herein, we report the results of two studies. The first is a numerical simulation comparing the ability of neural networks with discriminant analysis and logistic regression at predicting choices made by decision rules that vary in complexity. This includes simulations involving two noncompensatory decision rules and one compensatory decision rule that involves attribute thresholds. In particular, we test a variant of the satisficing rule used by Johnson et al. (1989) that sets a lower bound threshold on all attribute values and a latitude of acceptance model that sets both a lower threshold and an upper threshold on attribute values, mimicking an ideal point model (Coombs and Avrunin 1977). We also test a compensatory rule that equally weights attributes and judges the acceptability of an alternative based on the sum of its attribute values. Thus, the simulations include both a linear environment, in which traditional statistical models might be deemed appropriate, as well as a nonlinear environment where statistical models might not be appropriate. The complexity of the decision rules was varied to test for any potential degradation in model performance. For these simulated data it is shown that, in general, the neural network model outperforms the commonly used statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. An empirical study bridging the behavioral and statistical lines of research was also conducted. Here we examine the predictive relationship between retail store image variables and consumer patronage behavior. A direct comparison between a neural network model and the more commonly encountered techniques of discriminant analysis and factor analysis followed by logistic regression is presented. Again the results reveal that the neural network model outperformed the statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We conclude that neural network models offer superior predictive capabilities over traditional statistical methods in predicting consumer choice in nonlinear and linear settings.","West, PM; Brockett, PL; Golden, LL",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.16.4.370,consumer decision making; neural networks; statistical techniques,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the application of neural networks to predict consumer choices, which involves structured decision-making processes related to marketing analytics, predictive modeling, and consumer behavior analysis.

"In predictive modeling, firms often deal with high-dimensional data that span multiple channels, websites, demographics, purchase types, and product categories. Traditional customer response models rely heavily on feature engineering, and their performance depends on the analyst's domain knowledge and expertise to craft relevant predictors. As the complexity of data increases, however, traditional models grow exponentially complicated. In this paper, we demonstrate that long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which rely exclusively on raw data as input, can predict customer behaviors with great accuracy. In our first application, a model outperforms standard benchmarks. In a second, more realistic application, an LSTM model competes against 271 hand-crafted models that use a wide variety of features and modeling approaches. It beats 269 of them, most by a wide margin.

"This paper presents one of the possibilities of the decision theory that can be used in the modelling of the quality of life in a given city in the Czech Republic. Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model.

A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT.

"Gap analysis (GA) is one of the most popular techniques which has been widely used in service marketing to help businesses make customer satisfaction (CS) decisions through a service quality perspective. However, an assumption of a linear relationship between attribute performance and CS underlies the application of the GA approach. And this assumption is challenged by Kano's two-dimensional model which indicates the possible phenomenon of a non-linear relationship between attribute performance and CS. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to propose a novel GA approach through Kano's two-dimensional conception with the application of the neural network technique in order to extract the actual contribution offered by each attribute for CS improvement. A comparative analysis with the traditional GA approach and our proposed approach was performed by using an empirical study on a Taiwanese Human Resource service online agency.

"Purpose - The aim of this study is to develop an applicable and detailed model for customer lifetime value (CLV) and to highlight the most important indicators relevant for a specific industry - namely the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the results of the least square estimation (LSE) and artificial neural network (ANN) in order to select the best performing forecasting tool to predict the potential CLV. The performances of the models are compared by the hit ratio, which is calculated by grouping the customers as top 20 per cent and bottom 80 per cent profitable. Findings - Due to its higher performance; LSE based linear regression model is selected. The results are found to be highly competitive compared with the previous studies. This study shows that, beside the indicators mostly used in the literature in measuring CLV, two additional groups, namely monetary value and risk of certain bank services, as well as product/service ownership-related indicators, are also significant factors. Practical implications - Organisations in the banking sector have to persuade their customers to use certain routine risk-bearing transaction-based services. In addition, the product development strategy has a crucial role to increase the CLV of customers because some of the product-related variables directly increase the value of customers. Originality/value - The proposed model predicts potential value of current customers rather than measuring current value considered in the majority of previous studies. It eliminates the limitations and drawbacks of the majority of models in the literature through simple and industry-specific method which is based on easily measurable and objective indicators.","Ekinci, Y; Uray, N; Ülengin, F",Tactical,10.1108/EJM-12-2011-0714,Artificial neural network; Least squares estimation; Customer lifetime value; Linear regression; Marketing decision,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on developing a specific model for customer lifetime value (CLV) within the banking sector, which involves structured decision-making related to product development and customer engagement strategies.

"Purpose The negative influence of gamification on online communities has received little attention in the available literature. The study examines the adverse effects of gamification during engaging in online communities. Design/methodology/approach Gap-spotting methods were used to develop the research questions, followed by model development using the social exchange and social-network theories. Data were collected from 429 samples. The study applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses followed by ANN application. Findings The study identified five factors related to gamification that have a significant adverse effect on the mental and emotional well-being of the users. Furthermore, the results of PLS-SEM were then compared through an artificial neural network (ANN) analytic process, revealing consistency for the model. This research presents a theoretical contribution by providing critical insights into online gamers' mental and emotional health. It implies that gamification can even bring mental and emotional disturbance. The resulting situation might lead to undesirable social consequences. Practical implications The result highlights the managerial and social relevance from the perspective of a developing country. As respondents are becoming more engrossed in online gaming, managers and decision-makers need to take preventive measures to overcome the dark side of online gaming. Originality/value The present study shows that the dark side of gamification has some adverse effects on human mental and emotional health.

"This article discusses a model designed to help sales representatives acquire customers in a business-to-business environment. Sales representatives are often overwhelmed by available information, so they use arbitrary rules to select leads to pursue. The goal of the proposed model is to generate a high-quality list of prospects that are easier to convert into leads and ultimately customers in three phases: Phase I occurs when there is only information on the current customer base and uses the nearest neighbor method to obtain predictions. As soon as there is information on companies that did not become customers, phase 2 initiates, triggering a feedback loop to optimize and stabilize the model. This phase uses logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Phase 3 combines phases 1 and 2 into a weighted list of prospects. Preliminary tests indicate the good quality of the model. The study makes two theoretical contributions: First, the authors offer a standardized version of the customer acquisition framework, and second, they point out the iterative aspects of this process.

"We present an empirical framework for creating dynamic coupon targeting strategies for high-dimensional and high-frequency settings, and we test its performance using a large-scale field experiment. The framework captures consumers' intertemporal tradeoffs associated with dynamic pricing and does not rely on functional form assumptions about consumers' decision-making processes. The model is estimated using batch deep reinforcement learning (BDRL), which relies on Q-learning, a model free solution that can mitigate model bias. It leverages deep neural networks to represent the high-dimensional state space and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The empirical application is in a multibillion-dollar livestream shopping context. Our BDRL solution increases the platform's revenue by twice as much as static targeting policies and by 20% more than the model-based solution. The comparative advantage of BDRL comes from more effective and automatic targeting of consumers based on both heterogeneity and dynamics, using exceptionally rich, nuanced differences among consumers and across time. We find that price skimming, reducing discounts for attractive hosts, and increasing the coupon discount level at a faster rate for low spenders are effective strategies based on dynamics, consumer heterogeneity, and the two combined, respectively.","Liu, X",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2022.1403,dynamic pricing; coupon; deep reinforcement learning; reference price; livestream shopping; targeting,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes the development and execution of a dynamic coupon targeting strategy that interprets strategic goals into actionable targeting policies.

"This study assesses the feasibility of identifying self-reported sports practitioners (soccer players) on Facebook. The main goal is to develop a system to support marketers with the decision as to which prospects to target for advertising purposes. To do so, we benchmark several algorithms (i.e., random forest, logistic regression, adaboost, rotation forest, neural networks, and kernel factory) using five times twofold cross-validation. To evaluate performance and variable importances, we build a fusion model, which combines the results of the other algorithms using the weighted average. This technique is also referred to as information-fusion sensitivity analysis. The results reveal that Facebook data provide a viable basis to come up with sports predictions as the predictive performance ranges from 72.01% to 80.43% for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), from 81.96% to 83.95% for accuracy, and from 2.41 to 3.06 for top-decile lift. Our benchmark study indicates that stochastic adaboost, the fusion model, random forest, rotation forest, and regularized logistic regression are the best-performing algorithms. Furthermore, the results show that the most important variables are the average number of friends that play soccer, membership of a soccer group, and the number of favorite teams. We also assess the impact of our results on profitability by conducting a thorough sensitivity analysis. Our analysis reveals that our approach can be beneficial for a wide range of companies.

"Forecasting the demand of network of retail sales is a rather challenging task, especially nowadays where integration of online and physical store orders creates an abundance of data that has to be efficiently stored, analyzed, understood and finally, become ready to be acted upon in a very short time frame. The challenge becomes even bigger for added-value third party logistics (3PL) operators, since in most cases and demand forecasting aside, they are also responsible for receiving, storing and breaking inbound quantities from suppliers, consolidating and picking retail orders and finally plan and organize shipments on a daily basis. This paper argues that data analytics can play a critical role in contemporary logistics and especially in demand data management and forecasting of retail distribution networks. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to showcase how data analytics can support the 3PL decision making process on replenishing the network stores, thus improving inventory management in both Distribution Centre (DC) and retail outlet levels and the workload planning of human resources and DC automations. To do so, this paper presents the case of a Greek 3PL provider fulfilling physical store and online orders on behalf of a large sporting goods importer operating a network of 129 stores in five different countries. The authors utilize the power of 'R', a statistical programming language, which is well-equipped with a multitude of libraries for this purpose, to compare demand forecasting methods and identify the one producing the smallest forecast error.","Lalou, P; Ponis, ST; Efthymiou, OK",Tactical,10.2478/mmcks-2020-0012,Demand Forecasting Decision Making; Data Analytics; Statistical Programming; Retail Sales; Third Party Logistics (3PL) Operators,5.0,,15,0,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses how data analytics can support decision-making processes in demand forecasting and inventory management for retail distribution networks.

"Increasing rivalry for-profit or non-profit is pushing companies to devote more and more attention to pleasing consumers with excellent quality customer services. This study aims to develop a model to analyse customer behaviour in a retail store and provide accurate inference for decision making. Another critical objective for this research work is the adaptation of the faceted form of neuro-response, which is substituted by the Adaptive Fuzzy Logistic Regression Model (AFLRM). AFLRM has resulting benefits over Neuro-surface and Mean Demand Heuristic methods. A sample of 100 customers who visited or walked in the retails was used as a sample. Other than neuro-response surfaces (NRSM) and The Mean Demand Heuristic models (MDSM), the present study has accustomed a generalized form known as Adaptive Fuzzy Linear Regression Model (AFLRM) to deliver the benchmark for former models and give the highest level of accuracy for future behaviour of a customer. LINGO based Markovian analysis has also been used with the above model to understand the behaviour of the system understudy. The significance of service and product attributes is implicitly derived via the fuzzy regression model for customer satisfaction measurement. It is observed that the critical gap between the quality of product and services and Customer Satisfaction is Product/Service Satisfaction, Motivation and Buying Experience, and Credibility and Security. The authors' finding indicates that the effort of listening to the customer's voice should be more critical. Result analysis based on computational results concerning the questionnaire for measuring the customer behaviour and the system validates the model under study. Appropriate, useful with reliable action plans for every critical product and service aspect can be developed by applying the adaptive regression methodology to control the quality of service or managing the customer satisfaction, thereby providing executives with a competitive gain.

"Decision trees and logistic regression are two very popular algorithms in customer churn prediction with strong predictive performance and good comprehensibility. Despite these strengths, decision trees tend to have problems to handle linear relations between variables and logistic regression has difficulties with interaction effects between variables. Therefore a new hybrid algorithm, the logit leaf model (LLM), is proposed to better classify data. The idea behind the LLM is that different models constructed on segments of the data rather than on the entire dataset lead to better predictive performance while maintaining the comprehensibility from the models constructed in the leaves. The LLM consists of two stages: a segmentation phase and a prediction phase. In the first stage customer segments are identified using decision rules and in the second stage a model is created for every leaf of this tree. This new hybrid approach is benchmarked against decision trees, logistic regression, random forests and logistic model trees with regards to the predictive performance and comprehensibility. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and top decile lift (TDL) are used to measure the predictive performance for which LLM scores significantly better than its building blocks logistic regression and decision trees and performs at least as well as more advanced ensemble methods random forests and logistic model trees. Comprehensibility is addressed by a case study for which we observe some key benefits using the LLM compared to using decision trees or logistic regression. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling underpins modern marketing analytics, enabling the development of tailored customer relationship management strategies based on the predicted future value of their customers. As part of Amperity's enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing out of the box. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns.

"In recent years, parastatal grain marketing boards have re-emerged as important elements of grain markets in eastern and southern Africa, yet little is known about how farmers are responding to their scaled up activities. This article develops a conceptual model of farmers' production decisions in the context of dual output marketing channels (government and private sector) when output prices at harvest time and the availability of one of the marketing channels are unknown at planting time. It then applies the model to the case of Zambia and uses nationally representative household-level panel survey data to estimate the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the government parastatal maize marketing board, on smallholder crop production and fallow land. The FRA buys maize from smallholders at a pan-territorial price that typically exceeds market prices in major maize producing areas. Results suggest that increases in the farmgate FRA maize price raise farmer maize price expectations, which induces a supply response. Smallholders respond to an increase in the FRA price by extensifying their maize production. On average, a 1% increase in the FRA price is associated with 0.06% increases in smallholders' maize area planted and quantity harvested. There is also some evidence that farmers reduce the area of land under fallow in response to FRA incentives but there is no evidence of reductions in the area planted to other crops.","Mason, NM; Jayne, TS; Myers, RJ",Tactical,10.1111/1477-9552.12066,Grain marketing boards; maize; price expectations; strategic grain reserves; sub-Saharan Africa; supply response; Zambia,5.0,,15,0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,"The abstract discusses farmers' production decisions in response to government pricing incentives and market dynamics.

"Facing the challenge of attracting consumers and winning market share under the proliferation of TV stations and channels, the traditional TV stations often make some marketing strategies. However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies. Managerial implications are then discussed to guide the decision-making of traditional TV broadcasters and advertisers. (C) 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

"Consumers display an expense prediction bias in which they underpredict their future spending. The authors propose this bias occurs in large part because (1) consumers base their predictions on typical expenses that come to mind easily during prediction, (2) taken together, typical expenses lead to a prediction near the mode of a consumer's expense distribution rather than the mean, and (3) expenses display positive skew (with mode < mean). Accordingly, the authors also propose that prompting consumers to consider reasons why their expenses might be different than usual increases predictions-and therefore prediction accuracy-by bringing atypical expenses to mind. Ten studies (N = 6,044) provide support for this account of the bias and the atypical intervention developed to neutralize it.","Howard, RC; Hardisty, DJ; Sussman, AB; Lukas, MF",Tactical,10.1177/00222437211068025,expense prediction bias; consumer financial decision making; budgeting; accessibility; typicality; skewness,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses consumer expense prediction bias and proposes an intervention to improve prediction accuracy, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, particularly in areas like purchase prediction and marketing analytics.",wos-prediction,10,70,"Understanding and Neutralizing the Expense Prediction Bias: The Role of Accessibility, Typicality, and Skewness",2022
"Purpose - Retailers realize that customer churn detection is a critical success factor. However, no research study has taken into consideration that misclassifying a customer as a non-churner (i.e. predicting that (s)he will not leave the company, while in reality (s) he does) results in higher costs than predicting that a staying customer will churn. The aim of this paper is to examine the prediction performance of various cost-sensitive methodologies (direct minimum expected cost (DMECC), metacost, thresholding and weighting) that incorporate these different costs of misclassifying customers in predicting churn. Design/methodology/approach - Cost-sensitive methodologies are benchmarked on six real-life churn datasets from the retail industry. Findings - This article argues that total misclassification cost, as a churn prediction evaluation measure, is crucial as input for optimizing consumer decision making. The practical classification threshold of 0.5 for churn probabilities (i.e. when the churn probability is greater than 0.5, the customer is predicted as a churner, and otherwise as a non-churner) offers the worst performance. The provided managerial guidelines suggest when to use each cost-sensitive method, depending on churn levels and the cost level discrepancy between misclassifying churners versus non-churners. Practical implications - This research emphasizes the importance of cost-sensitive learning to improve customer retention management in the retail context. Originality/value - This article is the first to use the concept of misclassification costs in a churn prediction setting, and to offer recommendations about the circumstances in which marketing managers should use specific cost-sensitive methodologies.","Coussement, K",Tactical,10.1108/EJM-03-2012-0180,Retailing; Relationship marketing; Customer retention; Database marketing,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses specific methodologies for predicting customer churn, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"While customer management has become a top priority for practitioners and academics, little is known about how managers actually make customer management decisions. Our study addresses this gap and uses the adaptive decision maker as well as the fast and frugal heuristics frameworks to gain a better understanding of managerial decision making. Using the process-tracing tool MouselabWEB, we presented sales managers in retail banking with three typical customer management prediction tasks. The results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a significant increase in accuracy. Hence, the existing skepticism concerning heuristics should be questioned.","Bauer, JC; Schmitt, P; Morwitz, VG; Winer, RS",Tactical,10.1007/s11747-012-0320-7,Customer management; Adaptive decision making; Fast and frugal heuristics; Process-tracing; Mouselab,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The study focuses on how managers make customer management decisions, which involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable tasks such as predictive accuracy and the usage of decision-making heuristics.

"Consumers base many decisions on affective forecasts, i.e., predictions about future emotions. These predictions, however, are susceptible to systematic biases. The present paper examines the accuracy of predicting emotional change in the consumer context. The goals of the study were to examine whether predictions of a change in consumption-related emotions fit actual experienced change and whether original predictions are remembered correctly. A two-wave longitudinal survey with 86 consumers in Austria and the UK showed that consumers who had bought shoes overestimated the decrease of positive consumption-related emotions over time. Results indicate that the intuitive theory of adaptation is related to the prediction bias. Moreover, participants misremembered original predictions as more consistent with actual experienced emotions.

"Word of mouth has long been recognized to be an influential variable in marketing. With the growth of Internet applications, traditional word of mouth has evolved into the online form in a variety of Web-based outlets where individuals spread their perceptions via the written word. These expressions are often in the form of online reviews or assessments of products and services. In this article, we attempt to use features to represent reviews, which contain the sentiments of the consumers, and to predict the overall attitudes of online reviews of the consumers. Further, we want to look at which words are indicative/decision driven of a positive/negative attitude of the consumers, especially we want to identify a set of features which will result in a desired class-positive attitude in our case.

"Successful private club management requires multiple leadership skill sets and managerial capabilities including but not limited to; relational marketing efforts, quality service delivery, financial/asset management, member enrollment, and member retention activities. Given the uniqueness of private club industry ownership and member governance oversight, this places a premium on member relationships and financial performance. This study set out to uncover new ways of analyzing private-club member behavioral patterns utilizing decision-tree analyses to predict private-club member resignation patterns. Results indicated that non-revenue-generating private club events are the best predictors of member resignation within 120 days of departure. These findings provide new insight into customer behavioral patterns associated with relational marketing practices in private clubs and provide club managers with practical ways to improve member retention strategies.","Maier, TA; Prusty, S",Tactical,10.1080/19368623.2016.1113904,churn analysis; member retention; relational marketing; private clubs,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the analysis of member behavioral patterns in private clubs and suggests actionable insights for improving member retention strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific targets based on strategic goals.",wos-prediction,10,70,Managing Customer Retention in Private Clubs Using Churn Analysis: Some Empirical Findings,2016
"PurposeClimate change-induced weather changes are severe and frequent, making it difficult to predict apparel sales. The primary goal of this study was to assess consumers' responses to winter apparel searches when external stimuli, such as weather, calendars and promotions arise and to develop a decision-making tool that allows apparel retailers to establish sales strategies according to external stimuli.Design/methodology/approachThe theoretical framework of this study was the effect of external stimuli, such as calendar, promotion and weather, on seasonal apparel search in a consumer's decision-making process. Using weather observation data and Google Trends over the past 12 years, from 2008 to 2020, consumers' responses to external stimuli were analyzed using a classification and regression tree to gain consumer insights into the decision process. The relative importance of the factors in the model was determined, a tree model was developed and the model was tested.FindingsWinter apparel searches increased when the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, windchill, and the previous day's windchill decreased. The month of the year varies depending on weather factors, and promotional sales events do not increase search activities for seasonal apparel. However, sales events during the higher-than-normal temperature season triggered search activity for seasonal apparel.Originality/valueConsumer responses to external stimuli were analyzed through classification and regression trees to discover consumer insights into the decision-making process to improve stock management because climate change-induced weather changes are unpredictable.","Oh, J",Tactical,10.1108/JFMM-12-2022-0266,Decision tree; Weather change; Consumer search; Seasonal apparel,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on assessing consumer responses to external stimuli affecting winter apparel searches, aiming to develop a decision-making tool for retailers.

"Research shows that commitment-based interventions are among the most effective strategies to encourage pro-environmental behaviors, but methods to elicit commitments from a large number of individuals (i.e., door-to-door or phone campaigns) are often costly and unrealistic. Predictions requests-a commitment-type strategy-are an effective mass-communication strategy and have the potential to influence pro-environmental behavior among large audiences. This research is the first to demonstrate that prediction requests in a consumer behavior context influence preference for environmentally friendly products. In addition, this research examines the role of individual and contextual factors in influencing the efficacy of prediction requests. Study 1 shows that exposure to an advertisement with a prediction request leads to increased preferences for environmentally sustainable (vs. traditional) household cleaning products, compared to a control advertisement, and that this effect is greater when the prediction request is paired with an audience cue (vs. prediction request only). Study 2 indicates that the effect of prediction requests on preference for sustainable products is greater for individuals with interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal.

"This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) for market-driven product positioning and design, based on market data and design parameters. The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"At present, social networks are strongly used for personal or professional purposes. The social networks have accumulated a large amount of information, which can be used in different ways. One of such possible purposes is advertising. In particular, when a company pays for advertising in a social network, it wants to get an ideal deployment of the ads on the network. The ideal behavior aims at reducing the high costs to pay, the number of hours to design advertising, the difficulty in the creation of ads by lots, among other things. In particular, the optimization of the production of advertising on social networks, based on the performance of the ads, is not an easy task. If we make an incorrect design, this can result in losses for a company. In this sense, this paper presents an intelligent system of management of social network advertising, based on data mining techniques, to automatically produce ads. In addition, we test our adaptive mechanism of automated production (generation) of online advertising on Facebook. Our system carries out automatic modifications and improvements of ads.

"Marketing activity by distributors is a significant factor in attracting audiences to theaters before a movie is released. Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy.

"Marketing decision support systems (MDSS) incorporate both internal and external data in performing analytics to improve business effectiveness. Weather data have long been considered a crucial external data input in practitioners’ marketing strategy; however, academic research on how weather conditions affect consumer behaviors has been limited. To fill this gap, this research investigates how weather parameters, including sunlight, temperature, and air quality, can be incorporated into MDSS to predict consumers’ variety-seeking in their purchases using public weather data and supermarket panel data for five typical retail products. Our analyses show that weather conditions are associated with greater variety-seeking behavior.

"The banking sector, like other service sector, improves in accordance with the customer’s needs. Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not.

"To be competitive in contemporary turbulent environments, firms must be capable of processing huge amounts of information, and effectively convert it into actionable knowledge. This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Orriols-Puig A.; Martínez-López F.J.; Casillas J.; Lee N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.03.005,Genetic fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; KDD; Management support; Unsupervised learning,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of an intelligent system utilizing fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms for discovering associations in marketing and business databases.

"Unpredictable market conditions have forced textile sector to change the way of thinking and to introduce new technologies in order to increase marketing effects by quick and right decisions, shorter production cycles and more intense communications. Production cycle can be shortened in the phase of product designing and selecting, sampling, production and distribution. But how can the manufacturer decide for a certain product quickly and correctly? Primarily by using CAD/CAM system during the whole process, from idea, pattern, eleboration of technical data, sampling, preparation of production to final production. Another very important factor that additionally increases the importance of CAD/CAM systems is the globalization of the entire production process. Data transmission via internet is quick and considerably facilitates communications between buyers and manufacturers and remote production units. Textile CAD/CAM systems are mainly modularly structured and cover dobby weaving, jacquard weaving and all other textile fields. Optionally available are the packages for 3D simulation and marketing, compact discs with patterns and collections catalogues and virtual fashion shows. Systems for dobby and jacquard weaving are highly improved and simulations in proper density and by considering all constructional parameters look quite realistic.

"Automated products that take over tasks that consumers used to carry out themselves are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but consumers continue to resist such innovations. Drawing on the status quo bias as a theoretical framework, this article investigates the role of nostalgia in consumer reactions to product automation in a series of six experiments with almost 1500 participants. The first four experiments converge on a consistent finding: a high (versus low) degree of automation reduces consumers' nostalgic feelings about past consumption episodes, which in turn decrease nostalgia-prone consumers' product evaluations. Against this backdrop, we conduct two additional experiments to determine how firms' communication tactics can overcome the negative role of nostalgia proneness in consumer reactions to automated products. We conclude that managers involved in the marketing of automated products should assess the level of nostalgia in their target groups, and align both their intended positioning for the automated product and the decision to automate critical tasks within the product design that may evoke nostalgic feelings in consumers. Furthermore, when consumers are nostalgia-prone, managers should craft their launch communication tactics such that the focus is diverted from the automated task itself. © 2022 The Authors.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine private households’ preferences for service bundles in the German energy market. Design/methodology/approach: This investigation is based on survey data collected from 3,663 customers of seven mainly municipal energy suppliers in the German energy market. The data set was analyzed via a binary logistic regression model to identify the most prospective customers and their preferences regarding bundles of energy services. Findings: The results indicate that potential adopters of energy-related service bundles have greater prior knowledge about service bundles; place higher importance on simplified handling, flat rates and long price guarantees; prefer to purchase a service bundle from an energy supplier; live in urban areas and have a gas tariff; are both less likely to have a green electricity tariff and to support the German energy transition; have a greater intention to purchase a smart home product; are less likely to already be prosumers; and prefer customer centers and social media as communication channels with energy providers. Practical implications: This paper offers several implications for decision-makers in developing marketing strategies for bundled offerings in a highly competitive energy market.

"With the proliferation of online technologies, social media recruitment has become an essential part of any company’s outreach campaign. A social media platform can provide marketing posts with access to a large pool of candidates and at a low cost. It also provides the opportunity to quickly customize and refine messages in response to the reception. With online marketing, the key question is: which communities are attracted by recruitment tweets on social media? In this work, we profile the Twitter accounts that interact with a set of recruitment tweets by the U.S. Army’s Recruitment Command through a network-centric perspective. By harnessing how users signal their affiliations through user information, we extract and analyze communities of social identities. From Social Identity Theory, these social identities can be critical drivers of behavior, like the decision to enlist in the military. With this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of the U.S. Army’s recruitment campaign on Twitter, observing that these campaigns typically attract communities with military exposure like veterans or those that identify with professional careers and fitness (e.g., student, professionals, athletes). The campaign also attracts, but at a much lower level, interaction from those in the digital industries—data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, and so forth. When analyzing the accounts in terms of their degree of automation, we find a set of intent-unknown bot accounts interacting with the tweets, and that many of the recruitment accounts are perceived as automated accounts. These observations can aid in campaign refinement: targeting the digital community and getting a broader reach for online recruitment publicity campaigns. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

"Case (A) Birlasoft, a Global IT major, had been facing massive challenges in monitoring its sales force spread over 20 global locations. Owing to the strong client base spread all over the world and the massive sales force, the organization needed to focus on a more efficient sales tracking system. Ravi Kathuria, Senior Vice president - Global Marketing & Alliances of Birlasoft was keen to align the organization's dispersed sales force through Sales Force Automation (SFA) system. In this context, SFA was expected to provide transparency and clear visibility of the sales pipeline. There was also an expectation that SFA would help in improving efficiency of global sales force in terms of reporting and customer analysis. At first, the organization decided to implement a home grown sales force automation system, which turned out be a failure, owing to both internal and external factors. This led Kathuria to explore other options which could meet their system requirements and could be implemented in shorter time frames with minimum budget. They evaluated multiple options and are debating on which system to opt for. This case examines the various software delivery methods in the decision on new software procurement. Several software and vendor parameters and the analytical structure and process for evaluating software vendors are included for consideration. This case underlines an innovation which has introduced a complete paradigm shift in information application acquisition, that is, instead of buying software as a product, organizations are increasingly procuring it as a service. Case (B) Following from Case A, the team in Birlasoft appraised multiple options and the majority of the team members were inclined towards SaaS-based SFA. This case discusses various processes and parameters considered by Birlasoft while deciding on a new software vendor. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Jain S.; Jaiswal M.P.,Tactical,10.1142/S0218927515500121,,5.0,,15,0,World Scientific Publishing Co.

"The paper aims to identify how Industry 4.0 technologies affect the quality and speed of the managers' decision-making process across the different stages of the value chain, based on the example of the manufacturing sector. The paper adopts qualitative research, based on nine in-depth interviews with key informants, to capture senior executives' experiences with implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in their organisations. The research is focused on three manufacturing industries: the automotive, food and furniture industries. The research shows that depending on the stage of the value chain, different Industry 4.0 technologies are more suitable for the support of managers' decisions. Various Industry 4.0 technologies support decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain. In the Design stage, 3D printing and scanning technologies play a crucial role. In the case of Inbound Logistics, robotisation, automation, Big Data analysis, and Business Intelligence are most useful. During the Manufacturing stage, robotisation, automation, 3D printing, scanning, Business Intelligence, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine (M2M) integration enable quick decision-making and speed up production. Sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) optimise distribution in the Outbound Logistics stage. And finally, Business Intelligence supports decisions within the Sales and Marketing stage. It is also the most versatile technology among all particular stages. The paper provides empirical evidence on the Industry 4.0 technology support in decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain, which leads to more effective value chain management, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions at each value-chain stage. When using properly selected Industry 4.0 technologies, managers can optimise their production processes, reduce costs, avoid errors and improve customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, Industry 4.0 technologies facilitate predictive analytics to forecast and anticipate future demand, quality issues, and potential risks. This knowledge allows organisations to make better decisions and take proactive actions to prevent problems.  © 2023 Michał Młody et al., published by Sciendo.",Młody M.; Ratajczak-Mrozek M.; Sajdak M.,Tactical,10.2478/emj-2023-0021,decision-making; Industry 4.0; manufacturing industry; technologies; value chain,5.0,,15,0,Sciendo,"The abstract discusses how Industry 4.0 technologies can support decision-making at various stages of the manufacturing value chain, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.

"Background: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the marketing of the IQOS tobacco heating system as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) in July 2020, permitting its ‘reduced exposure’ marketing. This decision is accompanied by much controversy among the global health community. We provide a preliminary analysis of Twitter conversations regarding the MRTP authorization of IQOS by identifying the authors, valence towards the policy decision, source of cited link, and focused topic. Methods: We analyzed 548 tweets mentioning MRTP posted between July 2016 (when PMI submitted the proposal) and October 2020. Results: We found a higher proportion of pro-MRTP valence (25.4%) than anti-MRTP (16.2%). Nearly half of the tweets (47.2%) expressing personal opinions presented pro-MRTP valence (vs. anti-MRTP = 23.9%). The FDA website was more frequently cited in pro-MRTP tweets (30.8% vs. anti = 4.8%), while tobacco control advocates’ websites were cited only in anti-MRTP tweets (77.4% vs. pro = 0). Pro-MRTP valence appeared more frequently in tweets mentioning health (53.1% vs. anti =38.5%) and cessation (100% vs. anti = 0). Nearly 42% of tweets showed a bot score greater than.43, indicating a possibility of automation. Conclusion: Continuous efforts are needed to surveil the industry’s attempts to create a climate of false consensus and circulate misinformation regarding MRTP on social media, as well as to assist non-scientific audiences’ understanding of MRTP. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Jun J.; Zhang N.; Zain A.; Mohammadi E.,Tactical,10.1080/10826084.2021.2019777,content analysis; Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Heated tobacco products; modified risk tobacco products (MRTP); Twitter,5.0,,15,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The analysis of Twitter conversations regarding the MRTP authorization of IQOS focuses on structured targets such as user engagement, sentiment analysis, and the influence of different sources on public opinion.

"This paper focuses on the impact of digitalization and marketing automation on the “scope” of the heuristics adopted in the marketers’ decision-making processes. The “scope” refers to the decision-making contexts in which the use of the heuristic rules is diffuse and is effective. More precisely, “scope"" is (the extension of) the field in which a heuristic can be applied (successfully). The article is based on evidence collected through ethnographic interviews with twenty-three experienced marketers to discuss the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristic rules in decision-making. The marketers interviewed make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks as emerged from previous exploratory research. The paper discusses how the field of application of marketing experts' heuristics evolves as result of the digitalization and in particular of the use of automatic marketing systems. The adoption of the new automatic marketing tools modifies the task environment and the field of use of the traditional heuristic rules, but heuristics remain fundamental in the definition phase of the inputs for the automatic marketing systems, or for the interpretation of the output and therefore for the control of the marketing automation. The paper clarifies the concept of scope of heuristics and offers a rich description of the impact of marketing automation on scope. © 2022, The Author(s).",Guercini S.,Tactical,10.1007/s11299-022-00291-x,Adaptive toolbox; Digitalization; Ethnographic interviews; Marketers’ heuristics; Marketing automation; Scope of heuristics,5.0,,15,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The paper discusses the impact of marketing automation on the heuristics used by marketers in decision-making processes, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured decisions related to marketing activities.",scopus-automation,10,70,Scope of heuristics and digitalization: the case of marketing automation,2022
"This article is concerned with the relationship between time and success in the context of the procurement and implementation of administrative automation projects. It gives insight into the optimal thoroughness for user organizations to prepare themselves for the purchase of a new system. Interest in the subject stems from a contradiction found in the literature: on the one hand thorough (internal) planning and preparation of projects are recommended while on the other hand other authors state a plea for early (external) co-operation and negotiation with suppliers. Is a very thorough internal preparation a good pay-off or is it better to interact with potential suppliers after a restricted internal preparation? Results from this empirical research — which is part of a major study on marketing and purchasing of mainframe computer-systems — show that an optimum in thoroughness of internal preparation exists which is most effective regarding the quality of the project.

"Recent developments in video rental supply chains seem to indicate that revenue sharing contracts are beneficial to all parties involved in the industry. This paper illustrates a theoretical underpinning of the observed practice. A video rental supply chain is modelled to study pricing and replenishment decision making by the two autonomous firms in the chain, namely a movie studio producing the tapes and a video rental shop renting the tapes to customers. In the model the movie studio is to set the price for selling the tapes to the video rental store and the video rental shop must decide the number of copies of the new movie videotape it should purchase. The paper illustrates that revenue sharing contract can optimize the chain and bring win-win situations to the players in the industry. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd.

"Automated negotiation by autonomous agents has become increasingly important since the advent of e-marketplace. In this study, automated negotiation is viewed as a search process in which negotiators jointly search for a mutually acceptable contract in a multidimensional space formed by negotiable issues. This search is formulated as a multiple-objective decision making problem and is solved through an iterative process of generating offers by fuzzy inference systems. These fuzzy inference systems serve as a search heuristic and are formulated based on the strategy of issue trade-offs. Five experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed automated negotiation algorithm. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"Digital technologies are revolutionizing agricultural trade, enabling farm input suppliers to reach customers through multiple channels. The aim of this study was to segment farmers based on their purchasing behavior for crop protection products and to examine segment-specific characteristics in the digital environment. A cluster analysis of 590 German farm managers was used to identify five distinctive buyer segments based on five characteristics: dealer, brand and service orientation, price affinity and autonomous decision making. The results demonstrate that farmers place high value on personal contacts to stationary suppliers when purchasing crop protection products. Service orientation turned out to be a strong mediator of segment membership, while price and product brand are secondary to farmer segmentation. However, traditional typologies are only suitable for the digitization topic to a limited extent, as digital search and information behavior hardly differs. Even though digital information procurement is becoming increasingly interesting for all segments, an openness to e-commerce applies only to a small group of independent buyers. Concerning e-commerce attitudes, the perception of its advantages and the lack of personal contact differentiates the clusters the most. The results contribute to the scientific understanding of farmers’ information and purchasing behavior and provide initial approaches for the development of customer-centric corporate marketing strategies. © 2022 Schulze Schwering et al.",Schweringi D.S.; Hollenbeck A.; Krone S.; Spiller A.; Lemken D.,Tactical,10.22434/IFAMR2021.0095,Agri-chemical; Cluster analysis; Farm inputs; Omni-channel; Purchasing behavior,5.0,,5,0,Wageningen Academic Publishers,"The study focuses on segmenting farmers based on their purchasing behavior and examines specific characteristics for targeted marketing strategies.

"Automated calibration methods are a common approach to agent-based model calibration as they can estimate those parameters which cannot be set because of the lack of information. The modeler requires to validate the model by checking the parameter values before the model can be used and this task is very challenging when the model considers two or more conflicting outputs. We propose a multicriteria integral framework to assist the modeler in the calibration and validation of agent-based models that combines evolutionary multiobjective optimization with network-based visualization, which we believe is the first integral approach to model calibration. On the one hand, evolutionary multiobjective optimization provides several sets of calibration solutions (i.e., parameter values) with different trade-offs for the considered objectives in a single run. On the other hand, network-based visualization is used to better understand the decision space and the set of solutions from the obtained Pareto set approximation. To illustrate our proposal, we face the calibration of three agent-based model examples for marketing which consider two conflicting criteria: the awareness of the brand and its word-of-mouth volume. The final analysis of the calibrated solutions shows how our proposed framework eases the analysis of Pareto sets with high cardinality and helps with the identification of flexible solutions (i.e., those having close values in the design space). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Moya I.; Chica M.; Cordón Ó.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2019.113111,Agent-based modeling; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Information visualization; Model calibration,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a multicriteria integral framework for calibrating agent-based models specifically for marketing applications.

"Brand coolness is a relatively understudied but important marketing phenomenon that only recently has received systematic scrutiny. We investigate a multidimensional structure of brand coolness and show how it mediates the effects of product quality on word of mouth communication and on intentions to buy/use cool brands. We also demonstrate under what conditions brand coolness influences WOM and intentions. The self-concept, rooted in materialism and expressed as the desire to impress other people and to compare oneself to others so as to emulate them, serves to regulate the effects of brand coolness in a negative way on WOM and intentions, thereby fulfilling the autonomous function of brand coolness for consumers described in the past as one important aspect of brand coolness. In order to show the incremental contribution of brand coolness in predicting WOM and decisions to buy/use cool brands, the effects of brand coolness are tested in head-to-head comparisons with the influence of self-brand connections and attitudes toward cool brands, which are classically studied brand drivers, on a representative sample of 400 adult Americans aged 20–40 years inclusive. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bagozzi R.P.; Khoshnevis M.,Tactical,10.1080/10696679.2022.2081925,,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the mediating effects of brand coolness on word of mouth communication and purchase intentions, which relates to structured decision-making processes in marketing strategies.

"High-level autonomous vehicles (AVs) are likely to improve the quality of children's travel to and from school (such as improve travel safety and increase travel mobility). These expected benefits will not be presented if parents are not willing to use AVs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore parents’ intentions of using AVs to transport children to and from school (parents’ intentions). This study has two primary aims: 1) Exploring parents’ intentions and their potential determinants. 2) Making recommendations for manufacturers to develop and market AVs suitable for school travel based on the research results. Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents’ intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents’ intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents’ intentions. The direct impact of perceived ease of use and public engagement on parents’ intentions is not significant. Finally, this research could provide decision-making support for governments and manufacturers to formulate relevant policies and marketing strategies, promoting parents’ acceptance of AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Jing P.; Du L.; Chen Y.; Shi Y.; Zhan F.; Xie J.,Tactical,10.1016/j.aap.2021.105991,Autonomous vehicles; Parents’ intentions; School travel; Travel safety,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on exploring parents' intentions regarding the use of autonomous vehicles for school travel, identifying specific determinants that influence these intentions.

"Purpose: The selection of purchasing channels by wine consumers indirectly affects buying experience and satisfaction, therefore, it is of great practical significance to study consumers' preference on channel selection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of consumer selection for purchasing channel and the corresponding influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,976 valid questionnaires were collected by convenience sampling from 34 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China in 2020 via the Internet, yielding a response rate of 82.2%. A categorical statistical approach was used to understand consumer's selection for each channel. Besides, binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors affecting consumers' channel selection. Findings: The results show that Chinese wine consumers' main purchasing channels are as follows: supermarket/mall, wine specialty stores, comprehensive e-business flagship stores, comprehensive e-business individual stores, restaurants and short video and live streaming platforms. Estimation results showed that among the 12 influencing factors in 4 categories, consumers' education and some other factors significantly influenced consumers' decision on wine purchasing channels. Research limitations/implications: Limited by time and experimental conditions, this study did not analyze the trend of wine consumers' purchasing channel selection. Future work would concentrate on multi-year data and conduct longitudinal comparative analysis. Originality/value: This study innovatively subdivides the currently popular wine sales channels in Chinese market and conducts research related to consumer channel selection.

"Purpose: User acceptance is a necessary precondition to implementing self-driving buses as a solution to public transport challenges. Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications: This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value: While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment. © 2024, Myriam Quinones, Jaime Romero, Anne Schmitz and Ana M.

"Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research has focused on public acceptance of and intention to use AVs, with trust emerging as important to these variables. Research on AV trust has centered on trust in vehicle performance. However, trust evaluation may include AV manufacturers and developers, and regulation pertaining to AVs; thus, we expand our measurement of trust to include beliefs based on manufacturers and regulation. In this experiment, we manipulate information regarding manufacturer focus (i.e., an emphasis on standards, regulations, and research (SRR) versus speed to market) to determine its effect on trust. When information focused on SRR, we found higher levels of trust in AV performance and in manufacturers, compared to when it focused on speed to market. In addition, information regarding passenger control (i.e., the ability to take over for the vehicle and to determine privacy settings) was manipulated to yield either high or low passenger control conditions. Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AVs was lowest when speed to market was emphasized and when passenger control was low. Furthermore, trust was tested as a mediator between perceived risk and BI. Trust in AV performance partially mediated the relationship between perceived AV performance risk and BI. In addition, trust in AV regulation partially mediated the relationship between AV privacy/security risk and BI. Researchers should continue to examine trust beyond the AV itself to encompass trust in manufacturers and regulations.

"Introduction Co-operative societies have not been untouched by the social and technological phenomenon that has exploded online throughout the beginning of the century, which has connected millions of people and has had an undeniable impact on society. We are, of course, talking about online social networks. Specifically, we focus on the organic products sector, which is also becoming of increasing importance to society, as reflected by the continuous development of the market and that of olive oil, in which Spain holds a position of some importance globally. Objectives Thus, the aim of this study is to focus on the analysis of the use of and penetration of these online tools within the organic olive business community, with special focus on the entities in the Social Economy, the vast majority of which are co-operative societies. Design The population studied consists of organic entities that are processors and marketers of olive oil in Andalusia, registered in the Sistema de Informacion de la Produccion Ecologica de la Junta de Andalucia (The Autonomous Government of Andalusia Organic Production Information System, SIPEA). A structured telephone survey was carried out on this population, specifically aimed at the management of these 'organic olive oil processing and marketing' entities, where information on the use and commitment of the organisation was collected by the ICTs. Also, a checkpoint was created containing key account metrics of the organisations with accounts in the online social networks Facebook and Twitter. Other detailed statistics are also included in this checkpoint, obtained from analysing these accounts with on-line tools specialised in online social networks such as LikeAlyzer and Twitonomy. Methodology To determine the impact and penetration of the ICT, descriptive statistics were utilised, and then, a more comprehensive analysis of online social networks was conducted using the DEA method (Data Envelopment Analysis). DEA methodology, both nonparametric and deterministic, aims to measure the efficiency of a set of homogeneous decision-making units (DMU) using linear programming to compare identical inputs and outputs, to obtain a ranking efficiency (Samoilenko, 2014). Specifically, the variables that determine the efficiency levels considered as inputs and outputs of the model are the main metrics obtained on the use and success of the organisations in online social networks. In this way, the main activity indicators that reveal the use and development of these tools by the organisations have been used as inputs. The main monitoring indicators, which reflect the popularity of these accounts in online social networks serve as the outputs. The high level of sensitivity of the DEA method to outliers makes this one of the main weaknesses of the method (Wilson, 1995). To solve this problem we have used the super-efficiency method, detecting and removing observations contaminated by noise, which produces more accurate results and a more accurate classification efficiency (Banker and Chang, 2006). Results In a first analysis of the use of ICT by organic olive organisations, it is observed that the existing differences between the two types of organisations, SCA and SAT as compared with other legal forms, are not relevant regarding the presence of a website or the use of e-commerce. In relation to the use of virtual social networks, 53.74 percent of organisational leaders confirm they make regular use of these platforms. Discriminating between entities of the social economy and other legal forms shows us that 37.50 percent of co-operative societies and SAT report using these platforms. This is in comparison to 61.62 percent of other legal forms, representing a more than 24 percentage point difference between the two groups. On the other hand, although capitalist entities make greater use of virtual social networks, on average, they are less efficient in their usage of such platforms, compared with organisations in the Social Economy. Thus, the results obtained after using the DEA method show us that, considering the variable returns to scale (BCC model), 76.92 percent of co-operative societies and SAT are more efficient in online social networks, compared to 23.08 percent of the remaining legal forms. This increased efficiency is also maintained in the CCR model. Therefore, and in line with other investigations, this confirms that co-operative societies and online SATs use online social networks in a way that is more geared towards transactional rather than relational purposes (Lopez et al., 2012; Montegut et al., 2013; Munoz and Tirado, 2014), although their social nature is advantageous for them on platforms such as online social networks. Conclusions The differences between entities belonging to the Social Economy and other legal forms with respect to the use of websites or online stores are not significant. However, it is confirmed that the organic olive co-operative entities and their SAT counterparts clearly lag in the use of online social networks. In general, these platforms are largely undervalued by the business community in this entire sector. The inflexibility of co-operative societies in adapting to the changing environment and, in particular, to technological changes (COGECA, 2010), is considered a clear explanatory factor in these results. This is due to increasing awareness of its importance as the business use of online social networks is a relatively recent phenomenon. According to Bridges et al. (2010), greater market orientation and integration of co-operative societies is necessary, which will stimulate the commitment to online social networks. Furthermore, the results show that the SCA and SAT are entities that are more efficient in their use of these online platforms. We believe the main supporting factor for this is the aforementioned confluence of values between the Social Economy and Web 2.0. The relevance of communication within co-operative societies (Herranz, 2007) has made the Internet an indispensable yet still underrated tool. In this sense, the singular operational methods and characteristics of these entities (Mozas et al., 2015), makes the use of online social networks, an economic, simple and affordable media, which could be extremely useful for them. Therefore, the social identity that co-operative societies present and transmit gives them an advantage in online media, which results in an extremely efficient method of achieving greater popularity with a lesser degree of effort. As the main limitation of the study addressed the sectoral nature of the investigation, this makes it difficult to generalise about all entities in the Social Economy. However, given the scarcity of related studies, this research is a clear starting point for extending the analysis to other industries and institutions such as co-operative societies of second degree and above.

"Although a small body of research has examined the motivational foundations of homeowners' decisions to adopt rooftop solar panels, in this research we compared adoptive and non-adoptive homeowners in the United States (N = 824) across a spectrum of values and motives to identify the most salient predictors of solar adoption within various demographic and political strata. Results of hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that autonomous (i.e., internal) pro-environmental motivation linked to solar adoption regardless of age, income, and education. In contrast, the effects of altruism and controlled (i.e., image and status based) environmental motivation depended on demographic characteristics. That is, altruism was positively associated with adoption for older homeowners, but negatively linked to adoption for younger homeowners. Additionally, controlled motivation predicted solar adoption for both younger and higher income homeowners, but it was not a predictor for older and lower income homeowners. We highlight the importance of assessing interactions between demographics, on one hand, and motives and values, on the other, in order to reveal nuances in the motivations of different types of adopters.

"The data used in the opinion can be either factual or subjective, or both. The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information. The resultant data aids in creating autonomous systems that consider the input from customers and prepare restaurant strategies. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",Kumar V.V.; Raghunath K.M.K.; Muthukumaran V.; Joseph R.B.; Beschi I.S.; Uday A.K.,Tactical,10.1007/s13198-021-01379-2,Accuracy; Aspect-based; Classification; Document-based; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Uncertain feedback pool,5.0,,20,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses methodologies for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, which are tactical approaches to understanding consumer feedback and improving marketing strategies in the restaurant sector.",scopus-autonomous,15,60,Aspect based sentiment analysis and smart classification in uncertain feedback pool,2022
"Research that explores Muslim women's hospitality and tourism decision-making is limited. This paper attempts to bring a new perspective to the literature on social media and consumption decisions in the hospitality and tourism sector by focusing on Muslim women as a consumer segment. Based on a survey of 791 Muslim women in the UK, it finds that autonomous self-expression, self-disclosure, and reciprocity to self-disclosure on Facebook were positively related to bonding and bridging social capital, which in turn related positively to their empowerment in hospitality and tourism decision-making. Employment status moderated some of these relations. The paper breaks new ground by bringing together two disparate research strands in the tourism literature: one that focuses on women but ignores religion, and the other that studies Islamic tourism but overlooks the role of women.

"Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these models fire the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the right model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a generic model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward automating the crucial task of choice model selection.","Farias, VF; Jagabathula, S; Shah, D",Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.1120.1610,nonparametric choice; choice models; revenue prediction; utility preference; preference list; marketing mix,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a method for predicting revenues from consumer choice models and optimizing offer sets, which align with tactical decision-making focused on short-term goals and structured processes.",wos-prediction,10,70,A Nonparametric Approach to Modeling Choice with Limited Data,2013

The decision-making process for complex services is different because it has an additional intermediate step of indication of interest. The Web site is (a) visited and searched for information; subsequently, (b) a request for the service is made, which may lead to (c) a purchase. The authors acquired a unique data set from an online Dutch financial service provider, which offers services such as mortgage loans and insurance on the Internet on behalf of financial institutions. They also obtained information on whether the request for the service resulted in a purchase. The authors used the available information to predict the purchase using a latent class probit model.

"The tendency of bias identification and quantification with the goal of better estimation and prediction, grows. The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer's personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers' communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents. Theoretical implications of the findings request questioning the use of the personality traits as an interim stage in decision-making predictions. In addition, these findings fill the gap in the field of communication preference based on personality traits and personality estimators.

"Firms employ temporal data for predicting sales and making managerial decisions accordingly. To use such data appropriately, managers need to make two major analysis decisions: (a) the temporal granularity (e.g., weekly, monthly) and (b) an accompanying demand model. In most empirical contexts, however, model selection, sales forecasts, and managerial decisions are vulnerable to both of these choices. Whereas extant literature has proposed methods that can select the best-fitted model (e.g., Bayesian information criterion) or provide predictions robust to model misspecification (e.g., weighted likelihood), most methods assume that the granularity is either correctly specified or prespecify it. Our research fills this gap by proposing a method, the scaled power likelihood with multiple weights (SPLM), that not only identifies the best-fitted granularity-model combination jointly, but also conducts doubly (granularity and model) robust prediction against their potentially incorrect selection. An extensive set of simulations shows that SPLM has higher statistical power than extant approaches for selecting the best-fitted granularity-model combination and provides doubly robust prediction in a wide variety of misspecified conditions. We apply our framework to predict sales for a scanner data set and find that, similar to our simulations, SPLM improves sales forecasts due to its ability to select the best-fitted pair via SPLM's dual weights.","Kim, MY; Bradlow, ET; Iyengar, R",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2021.1340,data granularity; granularity-model selection; doubly robust prediction,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The research focuses on improving sales forecasts through methods that assist in managerial decision-making regarding temporal granularity and demand models, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",wos-prediction,10,70,Selecting Data Granularity and Model Specification Using the Scaled Power Likelihood with Multiple Weights,2022
"Firms spend billions of dollars developing advertising content, yet there is little field evidence on how much or how it affects demand. We analyze a direct mail field experiment in South Africa implemented by a consumer lender that randomized advertising content, loan price, and loan offer deadlines simultaneously. We find that advertising content significantly affects demand. Although it was difficult to predict ex ante which specific advertising features would matter most in this context, the features that do matter have large effects. Showing fewer example loans, not suggesting a particular use for the loan, or including a photo of an attractive woman increases loan demand by about as much as a 25% reduction in the interest rate. The evidence also suggests that advertising content persuades by appealing peripherally to intuition rather than reason. Although the advertising content effects point to an important role for persuasion and related psychology, our deadline results do not support the psychological prediction that shorter deadlines may help overcome time-management problems; instead, demand strongly increases with longer deadlines.","Bertrand, M; Karlan, D; Mullainathan, S; Shafir, E; Zinman, J",Tactical,10.1162/qjec.2010.125.1.263,,5.0,,15,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"The abstract discusses the effects of advertising content on demand, indicating a practical approach to implementing advertising strategies.

"Objective: Identify a new model of predicting customer behavior based on new variables that can be used by marketing management and adapted to their business planning. Methodology: New model has been used, with the definition of new calculation systems of the traditional variables R, Recency, F, Frequency, and M, monetary value, (RFM), related to the business periods. Besides, activation in each period P becomes a key variable for constructing the purchase cohorts of customers and identifying their potential. A new variable, Activation Loyalty, is recognized as a good proxy of the likelihood of future customer purchases. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis obtaining beta for each variable, including the periods of activation, presenting the relative effect of the variables, and the best global explanation of the model. Results: This new model, RFMAP, which includes Activation Periods and Activation Loyalty, presents a higher prediction accuracy and improvements over traditional models with a clear impact, useful and manageable lines of segmentation, and prioritization for marketing management in CRM systems. Limitations: The main limitation of this model consists that it is based on data of only one company, and it should show the value in other sectors and give a full insight through its transversal application. Practical implications: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers, not only to determine the best customers but also with lapsed ones. It gives a meaningful explanation of differences in customer behavior, which are present in the data and are being reflected in the model. Also, it provides a prescriptive prioritization of variables to be managed in the marketing plan and how to be implemented.","Vilaginés, JA",Tactical,10.7200/esicm.167.0513.4,RFM model; RFMAP; activation periods; activation loyalty; customer base analysis,5.0,,15,0,ESCUELA SUPERIOR GESTION COMERCIAL & MARKETING,"The abstract discusses the development of a new predictive model for customer behavior that interprets strategic goals into actionable insights for marketing management.

"Purpose Alternative payment means have been expanding rapidly in recent years. The need to identify the segments of customers that are targetable for both financial and nonfinancial institutions is growing. The purpose of this paper is to use two different methods, discriminant analysis and decision trees, in order to compare the effectiveness of the two methods for segmentation and identify critical consumer characteristics which determine behavior and preference in relation to the use of payment means. Design/methodology/approach Using data from 321 bank customers, decision tree and discriminant analysis methods are used, first to test the same set of variables differentiating the customers and then to compare the respective results and prediction ability of the two methods. Findings Results show that discriminant analysis has a better model fit and segments the customers in a more effective way than the decision tree method. In addition, each method shows different variables to differentiate the customer groups. Research limitations/implications The findings are limited to the sector and country of the study, as well as the convenience sample that has been used. Practical implications Suggestions for financial managers to better understand their customers' behavior and target the right group are discussed.

"Consumers routinely rely on forecasters to make predictions about uncertain events (e.g., sporting contests, stock fluctuations). The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing). The authors identify boundary conditions, generalize to other prediction formats, and demonstrate consequences of their findings.","Bagchi, R; Ince, EC",Tactical,10.1509/jmr.12.0526,event prediction; subjective probability; accuracy; outcomes; forecasting,5.0,,20,5,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"The abstract discusses how consumers interpret forecasts in relation to predictions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and consumer behavior analysis.",wos-prediction,10,60,Is a 70% Forecast More Accurate Than a 30% Forecast?

"Managing the allocation of shelf space for new products is a problem of significant importance for retailers. The problem is particularly complex for exhibitors-the retailers in the motion picture supply chain-because they face dynamic challenges, given the short Life cycles of movies, the changing level of demand over time, the scarcity of shelf space, and the complex revenue sharing contract between the exhibitor and the distributor. In the face of this complexity, the aim of current research is to provide a structure for analyzing management problems of exhibitors in the movie industry. Using a mathematical programming approach and a fast, but readily accessible algorithm, we propose a decision support model, SilverScreener, whose aim is to help exhibitors make effective and timely decisions regarding theater screens management. The major objective is to help select and schedule movies for a multiple-screens theater over a fixed planning horizon in such a way that the exhibitor's cumulative profit is maximized. By treating the multiple screens as parallel machines and the movies as jobs, we provide an analogy of the current problem to the parallel machine scheduling problem. We formulate the resulting problem as an integer program. We depart from the typical parallel machine scheduling problems by introducing the time-indexed formulation that is particularly useful for solving the current problem. An important distinction between the current problem and typical machine scheduling problems is that the present approach allows for the choice of which movies to play; typically, in machine scheduling, all jobs have to be scheduled. We provide various analyses of normative versus actual decision making, based on publicly available data. The developed model is readily implementable and appears to lead to improved profitability in different comparative cases. Through sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the above results are robust to variations in various parameters of the problem. The main findings and insights from the normative policy suggest the following: Based on SilverScreener's recommendations, the exhibitor can achieve substantially higher cumulative profit. The improvement over actual decisions in terms of profitability appears to result from a combination of better selection and scheduling of the movies. The general structure of the exhibitor's normative decision is: choose fewer right movies and ran them longer. We propose a two-tier integrated application of the model to show how the model can be applied to realistic decision making. The first tier involves development of a movie selection plan to help the manager plan an entire season and bid for movies before the start of that season. An ex ante revenue prediction scheme is developed, based intuitively on a matching of the forthcoming movies with similar movies played in this theater previously. If the forthcoming season's scheduling plan can be visualized as a two-dimensional (week-by-screen) matrix, then that matrix contains only empty cells before the first tier. After a bid plan is developed, the exhibitor can fill some of those empty cells. The remaining empty cells represent slots, which can be decided during the season by either extending movies the exhibitor booked before the season or by scheduling other movies which may become available later in the season, This motivates the second tier-adaptive scheduling approach-of the integrated approach. The second tier helps the exhibitor in weekly decision making during the season. This application involves rolling, and updating data, from one time window to another. The approaches followed in the two tiers of the integrated application are quite general in that they can incorporate a sophisticated demand prediction model, managerial judgments, or a combination of both. We also propose an alternative behavioral decision rule (heuristic), which exemplifies relationship dilemmas in the movie industry. This heuristic shows that the exhibitors need to be selective in their choice of movies and may suffer a substantial loss in profitability if they place too much emphasis on accommodating distributors.","Swami, S; Eliashberg, J; Weinberg, CB",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.18.3.352,movies; decision support systems; retailing; scheduling; integer programming,5.0,,10,0,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses a decision support model for exhibitors in the movie industry to optimize movie selection and scheduling, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"We develop a model of the evolution of inter-purchase times for a consumer-packaged product. After the introduction of the product, a consumer waits to make the initial purchase, then either waits to repurchase or decides not to. A repurchasing consumer repeats this decision process. The components of the model are the repurchase probability and the density function of the time to repurchase at each stage of the purchasing cycle. Issues of interest are: the strength of the dependency between successive repurchase times; the number of repeat purchases before stability occurs; the effects of consumer characteristics on inter-purchase times. The model of individual purchasing behaviour can be transformed via simulation to produce sales time series for a given population. As an example, the model is estimated for a product using Australian panel data. The accuracy of the model's prediction is compared with an existing model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"In most marketing experiments, managerial decisions are not based directly on the estimates of the parameters but rather on functions of these estimates. For example, many managerial decisions are driven by whether or not a feature is valued more than the price the consumer will be asked to pay. In other cases, some managerial decisions are weighed more heavily than others. The standard measures used to evaluate experimental designs (e.g., A-efficiency or D-efficiency) do not accommodate these phenomena. We propose alternative managerial efficiency criteria (M-errors) that are relatively easy to implement. We explore their properties, suggest practical algorithms to decrease errors, and provide illustrative examples. Realistic examples suggest improvements of as much as 30% in managerial efficiency.

"The paper examines the effect of different payment modes on hedonic post-purchase product evaluations over time. Two theoretical frameworks-mental accounting and cognitive dissonance-suggest such an effect, but are contradictory regarding its direction. Additionally, the paper examines whether prospective consumers are able to correctly predict post-purchase evaluations and the effect of payment mode over time. In an online survey, hedonic evaluations of 346 car owners in three ownership phases (one, two, and three years after purchase) were measured and compared to predictions of 75 prospective car owners. Two different payment modes (down payment vs. installments) were distinguished. Results showed an interaction between payment mode and the hedonic evaluation of the car over time. In the first and third year, the evaluations by both groups were similar; in the second year, the installments group rated their cars more favorably than the down payment group. Neither of the two theoretical frameworks-mental accounting or cognitive dissonance-is sufficient to explain the observed relationship between payment mode and evaluation over time. The results suggest that mental accounting theory should be expanded with elements of cognitive dissonance. Regarding predictions, prospective car owners did not foresee the effect of payment mode on evaluations over time. Mispredictions are of practical relevance because they can influence consumer decisions.

"The authors propose amodel relating a product's comparative price to the construal level of its associated communications and show how perceived expensiveness shapes consumers' response to the wording of marketing communications. A series of six studies shows that for both absolute low-and high-cost product categories, comparatively expensive (inexpensive) products are preferred when accompanied by high-construal (low-construal) messages, due to the conceptual fluency of the match between price-induced psychological distance and construal level. The model provides novel implications for designing effective marketing communications: comparatively expensive versions of objectively low-priced products (e.g., an expensive chocolate truffle) are best promoted through more abstract slogans, whereas comparatively affordable versions of objectively high-priced products (e.g., an inexpensive diamond pendant) are best promoted using more concrete slogans.

"Despite the ubiquity of social networking sites, the online social networking industry is in search of effective marketing strategies to better profit from their established user base. Social media marketing strategies build on the premise that the social network of online users can be predicted and social influences among online users can be estimated. However, the existence of various heterogeneous social interactions on social networking sites presents a challenge for social network prediction and social influence estimation. In this article we draw upon the literatures on self-presentation on social networking sites and signaling in online social networking to categorize six heterogeneous online social interactions on social networking sites into two typesarticulated friendships and communication interactions. This article provides empirical evidence for the differences between articulated friendships and communication interactions and the corresponding articulated and communication networks. In order to compare the impacts of the social influences based on these two networks, we utilize support vector machines to build a classifier to predict virtual community membership and we further estimate the marginal effects of these social influences using a two-stage probit least squares method. We find significant explanatory power of social influences in predicting virtual community membership. Although the communication network is much sparser than the articulated network, social influences based on the communication network achieve similar performance as the articulated network.

"The nested logit model has been widely used to study nested choice. A typical example of such nested choice is store patronage and brand choice. An important limitation of the nested logit model is that it assumes that all alternatives at both levels of the nest are available in the choice set of the consumer. While there is a wide literature on the incorporation of restricted choice sets into the logit model, the logical extension of this analysis to nested restricted choice sets has not been pursued in the literature. In this study we develop a nested consideration model that integrates store choice and brand choice incorporating the formation of dynamic restricted choice sets of both stores and brands. We term the model the nested consideration model and derive the related probabilities in a manner analogous to the well-known nested logit model. In an empirical illustration, we find that the nested consideration model shows better prediction than nested logit models (with the same explanatory variables). We find that it is important to account for dynamic store consideration sets rather than static sets or store loyalty measures. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate the importance of the nested consideration set model for correct pricing and store location decisions of business managers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The extended model provided a 55.2% out-performance relative to benchmark one. This can not only make up for official data release lag, but also help firms gain near-real-time insight into the consumer demand trends and reduce inventory costs. The findings suggest that firms can improve marketing performance by use of search engine promotion campaign.","Fang, JC; Wu, WS; Lu, Z; Cho, EH",Tactical,10.1142/S021759081743007X,Search query data; Huawei; MIDAS,5.0,,15,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,"The abstract discusses the use of real-time data from Baidu Index to enhance prediction accuracy in consumer behavior, which aligns with the tactical level of marketing decisions focused on achieving specific targets related to consumer insights and demand trends.",wos-prediction,10,70,USING BAIDU INDEX TO NOWCAST MOBILE PHONE SALES IN CHINA,2019
"This article argues the importance of social embeddedness at mobile providers by examining the effects of customers' network topological properties on churn probabilitythe probability of a customer switching from one telecommunication provider to another. This article uses data from regional snowball samplingthe only practically feasible network sampling methodto identify groups with significantly different churn ratios for customers with different network topological properties. Clear evidence indicates that individual network characteristics (node-level metrics) have considerable impact on churn probabilities. The inclusion of network-related measures in the churn model allows a longer-term projection of churners and improves the predictive power of the model. With no possibility to carry out repeated sampling, sample stability was checked through simulation results. On the one hand, this article highlights the importance and effectiveness of the provider's tailored marketing campaigns by showing that customers targeted by direct marketing campaigns are less threatened by churn than nontargeted customers. On the other, this article shows that social embeddedness blocks the impact of the very same marketing efforts. This article forwards the idea that social embeddedness, also prevalent in vendor switching, can be extended to understanding the development of professional societies threatened by membership churn.","Benedek, G; Lublóy, A; Vastag, G",Tactical,10.1111/deci.12057,Cluster Analysis; Consumer Behavior; Customer Relationship Management; Network Analysis; Social Network Analysis; Supply Chain Risk Management; Telecommunications,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The article discusses the impact of network topological properties and tailored marketing campaigns on customer churn probabilities, which aligns more closely with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific marketing goals and targets.",wos-prediction,10,70,The Importance of Social Embeddedness: Churn Models at Mobile Providers,2014
"We propose an econometric two-stage model for category-level purchase and brand-level purchase that allows for simultaneous brand purchases in the analysis of scanner panel data. The proposed model formulation is consistent with the traditional theory of consumer behavior. We conduct Bayesian estimation with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for our proposed model. The simulation studies show that previously proposed related models can cause severe bias in predicting future brand choices, while the proposed method can effectively predict them. Additionally in a marketing application, the proposed method can examine brand switching behaviors that existing methods cannot. Moreover, we show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of existing methods.","Miyazaki, K; Hoshino, T; Böckenholt, U",Tactical,10.1080/07350015.2019.1702047,Bayes estimation; Missing data; Multiple-brand purchase; Potential outcomes; Product-category purchase,5.0,,15,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,"The abstract discusses a specific econometric model for analyzing purchase behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The authors develop and estimate a model of online buying using clickstream data from a Web site that sells cars. The model predicts online buying by linking the purchase decision to what visitors do and to what they are exposed to while at the site. To overcome the challenges of predicting Internet buying, the authors decompose the purchase process into the completion of sequential nominal user tasks and account for heterogeneity across visitors at the county level. Using a sequence of binary probits, the authors model the visitor's decision of whether to complete each task for the first time, given that the visitor has completed the previous tasks at least once. The results indicate that visitors' browsing experiences and navigational behavior predict task completion for all decision levels. The results also indicate that the number of repeat visits per se is not diagnostic of buying propensity and that a site's offering of sophisticated decision aids does not guarantee increased conversion rates. The authors also compare the predictive performance of the task-completion approach with single-stage benchmark models in a holdout sample.

Extant research predicts that in the absence of an explicit correlation between product attributes, consumers will infer that the brand that is superior on the observable attributes is also superior on the unobservable attributes. The authors propose an alternative inference strategy that makes the counterintuitive prediction that the apparently superior brand is inferior on the unobservable attributes.

"Companies offering a wide range of products may have an interest in measuring the degree of diversity of their clients' shopping baskets as an indicator of consumer behaviour. Customers buying a wide range of products are somehow more dependent on the business and their switching costs might be higher compared to others that only buy a small number of products from your catalogue. We aim to provide companies with a tool to measure how heterogeneous their clients are in terms of the composition of their shopping basket. First, the objective of this paper is to take advantage of some approaches used in other fields to create a new measurement. Second, we will show some possible applications of this indicator in a business context. We consider that a client with low heterogeneity is not highly dependent on the business and is more likely to defect. To check if this intuition is true, we will test the dependence of heterogeneity and churn with real data. By proving our hypothesis, we will be potentially enriching churn models with a new explanatory variable, and we could prevent the defection of those clients scoring low heterogeneity by making the appropriate marketing decisions.","Nicolas-Sans, R; Ibáñez, DG",Tactical,10.1080/1331677X.2020.1835518,Shopping basket heterogeneity; churn; customer behaviour; hypothesis testing; market basket analysis,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses creating a tool to measure client heterogeneity in shopping baskets, which is a tactical approach to inform marketing decisions and reduce customer churn.

Extending the traditional discrete choice model by incorporating latent psychological factors can help to better understand the individual's decision-making process and therefore to yield more reliable part-worth estimates and market share predictions. Several integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) models which merge the conditional logit model with a structural equation model exist in the literature. They assume homogeneity in the part-worths and use latent variables to model the heterogeneity among the respondents. This paper starts from the mixed logit model that describes the heterogeneity in the part-worths and uses the latent variables to decrease the unexplained part of the heterogeneity.

"Purpose This paper aims to examine how, why and when incidental curiosity might have an influence on consumers' unhealthy eating behaviors in a subsequent, irrelevant context. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were conducted. Study 1 tested the basic main effect; Study 2 further tested the proposed process; Study 3 identified an important moderator and offered additional support for the mechanism. Findings Study 1 demonstrated the basic main effect that incidental curiosity increases consumers' preference for unhealthy food. Study 2 replicated the effect in a simulated grocery-shopping task and further provided direct process evidence that a reward-approaching orientation underlies the effect of curiosity on unhealthy food choice. Finally, Study 3 identified information nature as an important moderator of the effect. That is, when people are curious about threatening information, they are likely to adopt an avoidance motivation, which prevents them from seeking any unhealthy food. Originality/value This research contributes to the curiosity literature by demonstrating that incidental curiosity could have motivational impacts in the non-information domain, such as food choice.

"The authors study how strangers become friends within an evolving online social network. By modeling the coevolution of individual users' friendship tie formations (when and with whom) and their concurrent online activities, the authors uncover important drivers underlying individuals' friendship decisions and, at the same time, quantify the resulting peer effects on individuals' actions. They estimate their model using a novel data set capturing the continuous development of a network and users' entire action histories within the network. The results reveal that similarity (homophily) with a potential friend, the properties of a potential friend's network, and the potential friend's domain expertise all play a role in friendship formation. Via prediction exercises, the authors find that stimulating anime watching is the most effective sitewide intervention, which leads to the highest overall site traffic and the largest number of active users, and that recommending a friend of a friend as a potential friend is the most effective strategy in stimulating friendship tie formation. In contrast to the common finding for static networks, the results indicate that seeding to users with the most friends is not the most effective strategy to increase users' activity levels in an evolving network.","Ameri, M; Honka, E; Xie, Y",Tactical,10.1177/00222437221107900,social network formation; product adoption; user-generated content; peer effects,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The study focuses on specific strategies for friendship formation within an online social network, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"We propose a new approach to simulate the likelihood of the sequential search model. By allowing search costs to be heterogeneous across consumers and products, we directly compute the joint probability of the search and purchase decisions when consumers are searching for the idiosyncratic preference shocks in their utility functions. Under the assumptions of Weitzman's sequential search algorithm, the proposed procedure recursively makes random draws for each quantity that requires numerical integration while enforcing the conditions stipulated by the algorithm. In an extensive simulation study, we compare the proposed method with existing likelihood simulators that have recently been used to estimate the sequential search model. The proposed method attributes the uncertainty in the search order to the consumer-product-level distribution of search costs and the uncertainty in the purchase decision to the distribution of match values across consumers and products. This results in more precise estimation and an improvement in prediction accuracy. We also show that the proposed method allows for different assumptions on the search cost distribution and that it recovers consumers' relative preferences even if the utility function and/or the search cost distribution is mis-specified. We then apply our approach to online search data from Expedia for field-data validation. From a substantive perspective, we find that search costs and position effects affect products in the lower part of the product listing page more than they do those in the upper part of the page.","Chung, JH; Chintagunta, P; Misra, S",Tactical,10.1007/s11129-024-09281-4,Simulated maximum likelihood; Consumer search; Sequential search; Search cost; C51; D43; D83; M3,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a method for simulating search model likelihoods, which directly relates to structured decision-making and targeting in marketing analytics and consumer behavior.

"The sudden urge to buy, referred to as impulsive buying, is triggered by both a gamut of extraneous, market-related stimuli and internal psychological factors. The extant literature on this has majorly focused on the antecedents of impulsive shopping, prominent among these include traits (like sensation-seeking and impulse buying tendency or IBT), motives (utilitarian, hedonic), shoppers' resources (time and money), and marketing stimuli. Although personality is a key determinant of consumer decision-making, the role of personality traits, specially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, in impulse buying is not conclusive. Also, there exists a need for analysing impulse buying behaviour with respect to product-specific situations rather than general IBT. The present study fills this gap by analysing the role of three personality traits on impulse buying. A scenario-based online experiment was conducted, and the sample respondents were randomly categorised into two groups. The former group had respondents with an instrument to measure their IBT in general, while the later had respondents for whom the instrument was shared with a scenario built around the product category of apparel. With the data set of 386 respondents, the study reveals that the relationships between the two personality traits-extraversion and neuroticism, and IBT-are independent of the product category. However, the influence of conscientiousness on impulsive buying tendency depends on the product category.

"Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to predict the success possibility of supply chain practices (SCPs) implementation based on ten selected SCPs using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted, and for the same, data were collected from two organizations. The data collected from both the organizations were analyzed using AHP. The pair-wise comparisons of SCPs (usually, alternatives and attributes) are established using a scale indicating the strength with which one SCP dominates another with respect to higher-level SCPs. This scaling process then translated into priority weights. Once the priority weights of the elements/determinants of the module have been calculated, the presence of the corresponding element in the organization was evaluated. An evaluation rating of these elements multiplied by the established priority weights have determined the prediction weight for each SCP. Findings - The application of this procedure is described for the institutionalization module and can be similarly extended to the other SCPs/SCM implementation modules. By establishing the prediction weight for each module, the organizations will be able to evaluate the strength of the corresponding factors present before embarking on the SCPs. The organization can identify and create awareness of the essential elements in the SCPs implementation process and identify the actions necessary before implementing SCPs. The AHP can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation, especially for medium-and large-scale organizations. Research limitations/implications - The priority weights are subjective and assigned as per the judgment of SCM managers from both the organizations. Further, the priority weights can be obtained from more industry experts through a questionnaire. Second, in this model, only ten practices are taken into consideration for successful SCPs implementation; more practices may be included in future research. Practical implications - The methodological approach presented can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation in an organization. The outcome will aid practitioners to know the SCPs and benchmark the organizations on the basis of the methodological research conducted. Again, this model can simply act as a possible research model and the data can act as an example that can be utilized for other studies.

"Research on the effects of ethical attributes has recently gained traction. However, limited research has addressed consumer response to ethical attributes in the current context where product ratings have become of primary importance to make decisions. Specifically, this study examines the relative effect of ethical attributes on product evaluations across different product ratings. Building on cue consistency theory and the negativity bias, we suggest that ethical attributes gain weight when consumers evaluate a low-rated product. This process leads consumers to anticipate more warm-glow feelings, generating better evaluations for such low-rated products featuring an ethical attribute (vs. another type of attribute). Two experiments provide consistent empirical support for this prediction, and demonstrate that, compared to other attributes or no attribute, an ethical attribute increases product evaluations to a larger extent when the product received low (vs. higher) ratings. We show that this effect occurs because of warm-glow feelings: when product ratings are low, consumers anticipate more warm-glow feelings from purchasing a product with an ethical attribute (vs. another type of attribute), leading to better product evaluations. These findings have direct managerial and ethical implications for practitioners.","Bezençon, V; Girardin, F; Lunardo, R",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21403,cue consistency; ethical attribute; ethical product; negativity bias; product ratings; sustainable attribute; sustainable product; warm-glow feelings,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the effects of ethical attributes on product evaluations, specifically how these attributes influence consumer decision-making based on product ratings.

"Despite multiple calls for the integration of time into behavioral intent measurement, surprisingly little academic research has examined timed intent measures directly. In two empirical studies, the authors estimate individual-level cumulative adoption likelihood curves curves calibrated on self-reported adoption likelihoods for cumulative time intervals across a fixed horizon of 478 managerial decision makers, self-predicting whether and when they will adopt a relevant technology. A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a fixed period of two years.

"This paper extends the scanner-based choice literature by explicitly incorporating individual-level brand-preference data. We illustrate our model using a unique data set that combines survey and scanner data collected from the same individuals. The addition of individual-specific brand-preference information significantly improves fit and prediction. Furthermore, this observed heterogeneity better explains choice than does unobserved heterogeneity in the standard scanner model's parameters. More importantly, we find that the standard model underestimates the importance of consumers' brand preferences and overestimates both brand loyalties and price sensitivities. Brand loyalty is overestimated because models without preference information confound state dependence, heterogeneity, and preference effects. Price sensitivities are inflated because the average preference-based consumer is implicitly assumed to be more willing to switch from his preferred brand than is the real preference-based consumer. Further, standard models overestimate the heterogeneity in price and loyalty sensitivities and misidentify both price- and loyalty-sensitive consumers. The managerial implications of our findings and the applicability of our methodology when survey data are collected infrequently and for only a subsample of consumers are pursued. We demonstrate that even under these circumstances better populationwide pricing and promotion decisions are identified and more accurate targeting results.","Horsky, D; Misra, S; Nelson, P",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1050.0192,discrete choice; heterogeneity; scanner data,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a model that improves marketing decision-making by incorporating individual-level brand preferences, which aligns with tactical marketing analytics and customer targeting strategies.",wos-prediction,10,70,Observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity in brand-choice models,2006
"Sampling provides limited experience with an offering to promote its purchase, either now or later. Sampling involves an ongoing choice about whether to buy the sampled option. We propose that ongoing choice feels more like a choice when people consider opportunity costs. Consequently, we predict that opportunity cost consideration will accentuate the impact of ongoing choosing on enjoyment over time of the sampled option (i.e., a slope effect). It follows that when ongoing decision evolves toward not choosing the sampled option today, its negative impact on enjoyment should become more pronounced when people consider their opportunity costs, decreasing overall enjoyment. Studies 1, 2, and 3 provided support for this key prediction. Studies 4 and 5 showed that when the best alternative use of a resource people considered was more attractive, they experienced accelerated satiation from an unchosen sampled option. While previous research showed that opportunity cost consideration accentuated the impact of one-time choice on evaluation (i.e., intercept effect), we showed that it accentuated the impact of ongoing choice on enjoyment over time (i.e., slope effect). We also contribute to the understanding of the factors that increase overall enjoyment of a sampling experience, which should influence future purchase likelihood.","Bilgin, B; Lefkeli, D",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21836,enjoyment; financial constraints; ongoing choice; opportunity costs; sampling; satiation,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses how ongoing choices and opportunity costs affect consumer enjoyment and purchasing decisions, which aligns with the tactical level of marketing focused on structured decision-making and consumer engagement strategies.",wos-prediction,10,70,To neglect or to consider?

"Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of firm characteristics and crisis characteristics on remedies offered to consumers by firms in the event of a product recall crisis. Design/methodology/approach Published data on 868 product recalls in the US toy industry from 1988 to 2011 have been used to investigate the effects of firm experience in product recalls, type of firm (company versus intermediary) and product recall severity in predicting remedies offered to consumers in the event of a product recall. Findings The findings show that firm recall experience, firm type and recall severity are negatively associated with recall remedies offered. Specifically, firms offer lower remedies if they have higher recall experience, if they are upstream firms in the supply chain (farther from consumers) and if the recall is more severe. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses on the toy industry and does not consider product complexity, firm reputation and the role of external regulatory agencies in the prediction of remedies offered by firms. Future research may extend this study to include the above factors. Practical implications - Offering a high remedy to consumers of a recalled product may be a responsible decision by a firm, but it may also attract shareholder wrath.

"Customer base analysis is a key element in customer valuation and can provide guidance for decisions such as resource allocation. Yet extant models often focus on a single activity, such as purchases from a retailer or donations to a nonprofit organization. These models do not consider other ways that an individual may engage with an organization, such as purchasing in multiple brands or contributing user-generated content. In this research, we propose a framework to generalize extant models for customer base analysis to multiple activities. Using the data from a website that allows users to purchase digital content and/or post digital content at no charge, we develop a flexible buy 'til you die model to empirically examine how the two activities are related. Compared with benchmarks, our model more accurately forecasts the future behavior for both types of activities. In addition to finding evidence of coincidence between the activities while customers are alive, we find that the latent attrition processes are related.

"The literature has identified factors that determine the favorable evaluation of a new brand extension, such as sharing a common product category or providing similar core benefits as the parent brand. However, there has been little research on which of these factors has a greater impact on consumer evaluation. This study explores how self-regulatory focus moderates the relative impacts of benefit overlap (i.e., the consistency of core benefits provided by extensions) versus product category similarity (i.e., the similarity among product categories that include the extensions) on brand extension evaluations. The results of an experiment support the prediction that benefit overlap extensions have greater significance for promotion-focused consumers, whereas category similarity extensions are favored by prevention-focused consumers.","Chang, CC; Lin, BC; Chang, SS",Tactical,10.1007/s11002-010-9131-0,Self-regulatory focus; Brand extension; Benefit overlap; Product category similarity,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The study explores specific factors that influence consumer evaluations of brand extensions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The benefits of retaining customers have led companies to search for means of profiling their customers individually and tracking their retention and defection behaviors. To this end, the main issues addressed in customer base analysis are identification of customer active/inactive status and prediction of future purchase levels. We compare the predictive performance of Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD models from the customer base analysis literature-in terms of repeat purchase levels and active status - using grocery retail transaction data. We also modify the BG/NBD model to incorporate zero repeat purchasers. All models capture the main characteristics of the purchase and dropout process of individual customers and produce similar forecasts. There are some deviations in the cumulative purchase estimates of the models, which may be due to the characteristics of grocery purchasing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"This article explores the theoretical underpinnings of the dissonance framework in online consumer satisfaction formation process. Specifically, we suggest that any discrepancy between pre- and post-purchase service performance would help determine consumers' evaluations of online vendors. Drawing upon cognitive dissonance theory, a conceptual model is developed and tested in two different studies (preliminary and main studies). Using data from 191 college students collected longitudinally, the preliminary study demonstrates the validity and reliability of the measurements. Using a comparative analysis, the main study then tests our conceptual model as well as various competing models, including the expectation-confirmation model, with a sample of 292 online consumers. The results in both studies support our main prediction that the service encountered in different stages establishes dissonance. Specifically, we find that dissonance explains online consumers' satisfaction process to a substantial extent, as compared with disconfirmation under the same conditions in online retailers. This study contributes to providing an alternative yet substantial approach for expectation-confirmation theory, reflecting the overarching nature of online shopping.","Park, I; Cho, J; Rao, HR",Tactical,10.1111/deci.12176,Dissonance; Disconfirmation; Pre- and Post-Purchase Service Performance; customer satisfaction; Comparative Analyses,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The article focuses on understanding consumer satisfaction in online shopping through a theoretical model based on cognitive dissonance theory, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing strategies and customer engagement.",wos-prediction,10,70,The Dynamics of Pre- and Post-purchase Service and Consumer Evaluation of Online Retailers: A Comparative Analysis of Dissonance and Disconfirmation Models,2015
"This article reports the influence of two specific consumption situations-hedonic and utilitarian-on the magnitude of the compromise effect. Based on the literatures of different valuation processes (valuation by calculation vs. valuation by feeling) and hedonic versus utilitarian consumption, the authors suggest that the compromise effect will be stronger under the utilitarian (vs. hedonic) consumption situation due to different valuation processes. Three experimental studies were conducted, and the results have supported the prediction. In addition, the authors successfully excluded alternative explanations such as differences in willingness to pay, justification, and attribute importance.

"Purpose An intention-behavior gap often occurs for socially responsible consumption, where despite positive consumer attitudes, sales remain disappointing. This paper aims to test the ability of in-store priming to increase sales of local foods vis-a-vis imported, cheaper equivalents. Design/methodology/approach Laboratory and field experiments in three countries (Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia), working with an international grocery retailer, assess the ability of textual and pictorial-based point of sale (PoS) materials to increase the purchase of local foods. Field sales data, for the purchase of local apples and cherries and their imported equivalents, are complemented by an analysis of loyalty card transactions. Findings Field data indicate that both pictorial and textual PoS materials, significantly increase the likelihood of purchasing local foods, against cheaper imported equivalents. Pictorial PoS materials appear more effective than textual equivalents. Laboratory study data indicate that PoS materials increase the salience of goal consistent mechanisms in decision-making at the expense of mechanisms to achieve non-primed goals. Research limitations/implications The field experiment lasted for only two weeks and focused on seasonal produce. Practical implications PoS materials offer a low cost intervention for modifying consumer behavior in stores. Originality/value The paper develops a theory regarding how priming works and its application in a supermarket setting. This is investigated and validated in the context of local foods. The study offers encouragement for the usefulness of other in-store primes, such as relating to diet, to improve socially desirable outcomes without economic incentives or coercion and in a cost-effective manner.","Brecic, R; Coric, DS; Lucic, A; Gorton, M; Filipovic, J",Tactical,10.1108/EJM-07-2019-0604,Supermarkets; Field experiment; Priming; Local foods,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on specific interventions (in-store priming) to influence consumer behavior and increase sales of local foods, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",wos-prediction,10,70,Local food sales and point of sale priming: evidence from a supermarket field experiment,2021
"Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task's perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms' perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.","Castelo, N; Bos, MW; Lehmann, DR",Tactical,10.1177/0022243719851788,algorithms; new products; technology adoption,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses how to increase consumer trust and reliance on algorithms for tasks that may be perceived as subjective, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, particularly in areas like consumer engagement and recommendation systems.",wos-prediction,10,70,Task-Dependent Algorithm Aversion,2019

"Many firms use decision tools called automatic recommendation systems that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark models.

"Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this model-based recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate returns to search (getting a better product and/or a lower price as a result of search) when consumers use/do not use recommendation agents (RAs). Specifically, it studies the effect of RAs/no RAs on decision quality, decision confidence and decision satisfaction taking into account subjective knowledge (SK) and involvement. Design/methodology/approach - This paper employed two between-subjects factorial experimental designs with subjects searching for digital cameras in a simulated online digital camera store. The experiment was conducted with graduate students in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mysore in India. Findings - Results of two online experiments showed that when consumers used RAs, low search led to better decision quality, whereas when consumers did not use RAs, medium search led to optimum decision quality. When consumers use RAs, SK had a U-shaped influence on the decision quality indicating that decision quality was the lowest for those with medium SK. When consumers did not use RAs, the effect of SK on decision quality was an inverted U-shape, indicating optimum decision quality for medium SK consumers. When consumers did not use RAs, subjects with high involvement made better choices, whereas when consumers used RAs, low involvement subjects made better choices. However, subjects who searched more had higher decision confidence and decision satisfaction even if their choices were not better. Originality/value - The effect of RA vs no RA in conjunction with relevant consumer characteristics influencing decision quality of the consumer is demonstrated in this study.

"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the complex role of consumer participation by empirically testing a theoretical model within the online context of consumer using product recommendation agents (RAs) that integrates consumer participation into the technology acceptance model (TAM). Recent research starts questioning whether consumer participation is a double-edged sword, although its positive effects have been widely documented in the services marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 243 respondents comprising both genders with varied age groups, education levels, household income and ethnicities. Participants interacted with an existing RA, searching product information for a simulated purchase involving either high or low financial risk. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural equations modeling (SEM) were used for assessing construct validity and testing hypotheses, respectively. Findings - Consumer participation was found to positively affect enjoyment but negatively affect perceived ease of use of an RA, which was exacerbated when the purchase was of high financial risk. Predictions based on TAM were all supported in this study. Research limitations/implications - This research evidenced consumer participation's dual-effect and identified financial risk as a moderator of consumer participation' negative effect. Future research could employ a different design such as using controlled lab settings and conducting longitudinal studies to replicate the study. Practical implications - Findings from this research provide guidance to RA design regarding the amount of consumer participation, consumer perceptions of RA use (ease of use, usefulness and enjoyment) and financial risk involved in the purchase. Originality/value - This research sheds new light on the role of consumer participation through uncovering its dual-effect, thus complementing the services marketing and RA literature.","Sheng, XJ; Zolfagharian, M",Tactical,10.1108/JSM-04-2013-0098,Participation; Technology; Online; Recommendation,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper examines consumer participation in product recommendation agents (RAs), focusing on empirical testing that informs design and decision-making at a tactical level.

"E-business leverages digital channels to scale its functions and services and operates by connecting and retaining customers using marketing initiatives. To increase the likelihood of a sale, the business must recommend additional items that the customers may be unaware of or may find appealing. Recommender Engine (RE) is considered to be the preferred solution in these cases for reasons that include delivering relevant items, hence improving cart value, and boosting customer engagement. The paper describes a model for delivering real-time, personalised marketing information concerning the recommended items for online and offline customers, using a blend of selling strategies: up-selling, cross-selling, best-in-class-selling, needs-satisfaction-selling and consultative-selling. The model further defines the e-marketplace by clustering items, customers and unique selling proposition (USP), and then gathering, storing, and processing transactional data, and displaying personalised marketing information to support the customer in their decision-making process, even when purchasing from large item spaces. An experimental study using a quantitative research methodology was conducted in a mid-size healthcare retailer, based out of India, to determine the tangible benefits. The model was tested with 100 online customers and, with the adoption of the proposed methodology, the results indicated growth in average monthly revenue (33.49%), Average Order Value (AOV) (32.79%) and Items per Order (IPO) (1.93%).","Behera, RK; Gunasekaran, A; Gupta, S; Kamboj, S; Bala, PK",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.03.026,Personalized digital marketing; Recommender engine; Customer relationship management,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a model for personalized marketing and sales enhancement through recommendations, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on achieving specific marketing targets and customer engagement strategies.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Personalized digital marketing recommender engine,2020

Yet, the role of consumer participation in using RAs has not been examined. This study shows that greater consumer participation in using an RA leads to more satisfaction, greater trust, and higher purchase intentions, related to the RA and its recommendations. In contrast, the financial risk (associated with the product under consideration) reduces satisfaction, trust, and purchase intentions, and it also moderates the effect of consumer participation on these same variables.

"In the fiercely competitive landscape of the peer-to-peer accommodation platform Airbnb, understanding customers' online recommendation behavior is essential for optimizing competitiveness and harnessing the potential of electronic word-of-mouth. This study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the factors driving customers' issuance of positive or negative recommendations based on their experiences. Leveraging 10,101 online reviews from Airbnb users, we employ the Structural Topic Model to determine latent topics relating to customers' recommendation intentions. This study reveals that positive recommendations are primarily influenced by hedonic values tied to the overall experience, including crucial aspects such as convenience for exploring points of interest, local authenticity, social interaction, and emotional fulfillment. These findings highlight the significance of providing memorable and enriching experiences to elicit positive reviews from customers. On the other hand, negative recommendations are closely linked to utilitarian values focused on practical concerns such as check -in procedures, cleanliness, comfortableness, and amenities. Understanding these utilitarian factors is vital for hosts and platform administrators to improve service quality and address potential issues that may lead to negative reviews. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the significant role of hosts in shaping both positive and negative recommendations.

"Mobile payment systems offer enormous potential as alternative payment solutions. However, the diffusion of mobile payments over the years has been less than optimal despite the numerous studies that have explored the reasons for its adoption. Consequently, there is an increased interest in exploring alternative actions for promoting its diffusion, especially user recommendation of the technology. This is because positive recommendations can enormously influence the decisions of potential consumers to use the technology while negative recommendations can increase resistance to it. The few extant studies in this domain have followed the traditional survey approach with hypothetic-deductive reasoning, thus limiting an understanding of factors outside their conceptual models that could influence recommendations. To address this shortcoming, this study uses a qualitative text-mining approach that explores themes from user reviews of mobile payment applications (apps). Using 5955 reviews from 16 mobile payment apps hosted on the Google Play store, this study applied the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) text-mining method to extract themes from the reviews that help to explain why users provide positive or negative recommendations about mobile payment systems. A total of 13 themes (i.e. ease of use, usefulness, convenience, security, reliability, satisfaction, transaction speed, time-saving, customer support, output quality, perceived cost, usability and trust) were generated from the LDA model which provides both theoretical and practical insights for advancing mobile payments diffusion and research.","Verkijika, SF; Neneh, BN",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102743,Mobile payment; Text-mining; Positive recommendation; Negative recommendation,5.0,,25,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The study focuses on user recommendations and themes influencing mobile payment adoption, which aligns with tactical decisions aimed at interpreting strategic goals into actionable insights for improving user engagement and technology diffusion.",wos-recommendation,10,60,Standing up for or against: A text-mining study on the recommendation of mobile payment apps,2021
"With the rapid development of social commerce, how to push and diffuse marketing messages in online social network (OSN) more effectively has increasingly become a significant issue, which can result in benefits for enterprises, users and platforms. A fundamental solution to this issue is how to accurately and comprehensively model user interest. To resolve such a significant and challenging task, our study constructed a user interest graph represented by a hierarchical tree structure that covers a wide range of topics, from coarse-grained to fine-grained three-level interest topics, such as food, entertainment and shopping, with a total of 167 nodes. In addition, considering that a user's interests are always changing over time, an exponential interest decay scheme is employed in this study. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model by comparing it with three benchmarks designed based on the proposed algorithm and two similar hierarchical user interest models. The experimental results demonstrate our model works well to predict user interests.

"Bias-driven marketing leverages the behavioral biases of investors for greater marketing gains. To transform cognitively biased individuals from antagonists into allies, the marketers need to decipher the critical crowdfunding attributes, which ultimately motivate behaviorally biased crowdfunders to invest in crowdfunding campaigns. Hence, this study seeks to investigate the influential factors concerning four behavioral biases that accelerate crowdfunding adoption. A conceptual model, parameterized using conjoint analysis, is developed and administered in an agent-based behavior model to effectively determine the influential crowdfunding attributes, which will induce the biased investors to adopt crowdfunding. The results revealed that status quo biased individuals adopted the crowdfunding campaign when launched by well-known and reputed fund raisers. Whereas, hyperbolic discounting bias accelerated the adoption when the campaign reached more than 75% of subscription and duration was lesser than 30 days. The results also indicated that framing bias enhanced the adoption when the risk inherent in the project is disclosed. Finally, the results also claimed that individuals liable to loss aversion bias expected a known funder, who posts frequent updates and preferred the All-or-Nothing crowdfunding model. The experimental results of the study provide insights to the marketers that crowdfunding campaigns can be successfully strategized through the exploration of underlying cognitive biases and the corresponding motivational cues that accentuate the pledging behavior of the funders. Given the importance of an effective marketing strategy in crowdfunding adoption, this study offers one such recommendation to the crowdfunding campaigners by demonstrating how bias driven marketing strategy enhances the adoption rate of the campaigns. With the strong pieces of evidence obtained from this study, it is anticipated that behavioral biases, drawn from the neuromarketing theory, will no longer be viewed as cognitive errors from the investor's perspective. Rather, it will be viewed as a boon from the marketer's perspective as the bias-based marketing strategies have the potential to achieve a fully subscribed crowdfunding campaign.","Panneerselvam, T; Arun, CJ",Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12795,agent based behavior model; behavioral bias; bias driven marketing; crowdfunding adoption; modeling biased funders,0.0,,15,5,WILEY,"The abstract discusses specific strategies related to marketing in crowdfunding, focusing on how to utilize behavioral biases to enhance campaign adoption rates.

"Despite the importance of analysing virtual reality (VR) technology acceptance by older adults and investigating the use of this technology as a marketing tool to enhance destination tourism word of mouth (WOM), no study seems to have addressed these issues. Thus, this study explores how the technology acceptance model (TAM) and anxiety regarding the use of VR after virtually visiting a tourist destination influence older adults' intention to reuse VR for tourism. Most importantly, this study examines whether this intention is related to WOM recommendations of a virtually visited tourist destination. Using a combination of quantitative (PLS) and qualitative (thematic analysis) methods, this study uses data gathered from older adults living in four continuing care retirement communities. VR glasses (Oculus Go Standalone) were used to virtually visit the Carnival of Venice. Results show that the TAM factors are key drivers of older adults' use of VR, which in turn influences tourist destination recommendations.

"Link structures among items within an E-commerce Web site can be regarded as a potential recommendation that helps new consumers quickly locate relevant products. In this paper, combining a modified version of Google's PageRank method with economic analysis of word of mouth, we investigate whether a product's position within a network composed of recommendation links is incrementally informative about its future sales. Based on data from Amazon.com, we document that with consumer word of mouth and other product characteristics controlled, the position of a product within a recommendation network does influence consumers' purchase decisions, and models incorporating link structure have a higher incremental predictive power of future sales than models without. In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context. Our results show that compared to general Internet surfing behavior, consumer consumption on Amazon is less random. We conclude that even though the product position within a recommendation network does influence customers' purchase behaviors, product sales are still mainly driven by their own product characteristics.","Hu, N; Tian, GL; Liu, L; Liang, B; Gao, YJ",Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2010.2064318,Collaborative-filtering cross sale; marketing strategy; online word of mouth (WOM); PageRank; price strategy,5.0,,15,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"The abstract discusses how link structures within an E-commerce website influence consumer purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at optimizing product visibility and recommendations.

"Purpose Grounded in regulatory mode theory (RMT), this study aims to investigate the impact of managers' orientation for action (locomotion and assessment) in business-to-business positioning decision-making. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected using a scenario-based experimental design. Study 1 examines whether interest and involvement in recommending a positioning strategy depends on a manager's regulatory mode orientation. The impact of such orientations on the likelihood of changing a recommended positioning strategy is the focus of Study 2. The moderating effects of task motivation (expected rewards resulting from a recommendation), market feedback and the line manager's leadership style are examined. Findings Both assessment and locomotion are significant determinants of involvement in recommending a positioning strategy. The introduction of motivation as a moderator helps explain differences in level of interest in positioning decision-making.

"The analysis of customer value in direct marketing typically combines customer timing and quantity data into a single statistic that is used to compute lifetime values, rank-order customers for differential action, and identify prospects for cross-selling. However, current models assume that purchase timing and quantity decisions are independently realized (i.e., uncorrelated) over time given individual-level parameters. In this article, the authors show that customer value calculations can be severely biased in these models when timing and quantity are dependently related. The authors propose alternative models that lead to substantial gains in profitability in two direct-marketing data sets. The results indicate that the commonly held assumption of independence leads to an over-valuation of customer value.","Jen, LC; Chou, CH; Allenby, GM",Tactical,10.1509/jmkr.46.4.482,customer relationship management; customer scoring; lifetime value; covariance heterogeneity; Bayesian analysis,5.0,,15,0,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"The abstract discusses the analysis of customer value in direct marketing and the impact of timing and quantity decisions on customer valuations, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions and strategies.

"Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aims for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives x attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making In particular, rye focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality RA the efficiency of purchase decisions-shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort, This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.","Häubl, G; Trifts, V",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.19.1.4.15178,,5.0,,15,0,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses the effects of interactive decision aids on consumer decision making in online shopping environments, which aligns with tactical decision processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets, focusing on specific tools and methods for improving consumer engagement and purchase decisions.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Consumer decision making in online shopping environments:: The effects of interactive decision aids,2000
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the key factors that affect consumer redemption intention toward mobile coupons recommended in social network sites (SNS). Design/methodology/approach A research model that integrates recommendation trust, positive utilities, and negative utilities of coupon redemption is developed. With the important role of trust in social recommendation taken into consideration, the key drivers of recommendation trust were analyzed in the model. Data were collected from 210 users with mobile coupon recommendation experience in one of the largest SNS (i.e. WeChat) in China. The authors used partial least squares technique to analyze the model. Findings Recommendation trust and positive utilities (economic benefits and perceived enjoyment) positively affect the intention of mobile coupon redemption. Perceived risk, as a negative utility, negatively influences coupon redemption intention. In addition, swift trust (structure assurance, perceived similarity, trust propensity, and expertise of the recommender), knowledge-based trust (familiarity with the retailers), and emotion-based trust (social tie strength) are key drivers that promote recommendation trust. Originality/value While prior research investigated mobile coupon redemption behavior in which coupons were issued by merchants, limited research analyzed consumer responses toward mobile coupons in social recommendation. This study examines the effects of recommendation trust, positive utilities, and negative utilities on mobile coupon redemption in the context of social recommendation and recognizes the key drivers of recommendation trust.","Tang, Q; Liu, F; Liu, S; Ma, YF",Tactical,10.1108/MD-03-2017-0234,Social media marketing; Trust; Redemption; Mobile coupon; Social recommendation,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses specific factors influencing consumer behavior regarding mobile coupons in a social network context, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on structured goals and consumer engagement strategies.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Consumers' redemption behavior of recommended mobile coupons in social network sites,2019
"We consider the multiattribute design problem (MADP) which contains a considerable number of alternatives, resulting from the combination of a limited number of discrete levels of several quantitative and/or qualitative attributes. In order to solve such problems, the preferences of individual decision makers have to be measured. Though a considerable number of methods is available from different research areas, only a subset is applicable to MADP. In this paper, we report on an empirical study which considered the problem of designing a university and involved more than 300 respondents. Because of this large-scale design, we performed a paper-and-pencil investigation and selected methods which could concisely be applied in such a setting: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the conjoint analysis (CA). The results show that both methods give useful models of the respondents' preferences. However, inspecting the utility functions determined in detail reveals considerable discrepancies between them. Most of the measures used for comparison indicate AHP to be the better choice for the special decision situation considered. In order to get a more general recommendation, we categorize different types of MADP and discuss the applicability of AHP and CA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"Social networking sites are becoming an essential part of consumer daily activities, with profound changes in purchasing behavior compared to traditional buying formats. This study investigates the possible impact of social networking sites on the purchasing decision process concerning luxury vehicles in one of the most important markets for such products, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The study also investigates the possible impact of relative demographics on the direct relationship between social networking sites (independent variable) and the purchase decision process (dependent variable) of luxury vehicles. In order to achieve this aim, a descriptive analytical methodology is utilized with quantitative survey strategy, with a five-point Likert-type questionnaire. Of 1,500 personally submitted questionnaires distributed over a non-probability quota sample to the main showrooms and dealerships in the GCC, 1,257 were retrieved (a response rate of 83.8%); after the filtration and screening process, 1,224 valid questionnaire forms were statistically analyzed. The results indicate that social networking sites have a significant positive direct impact on the purchasing decision process of luxury vehicles in the examined population, with the highest impact being for the first two stages of the process (need recognition and information search). As for the moderation effect of relative demographics, only income and time daily time spent on social media had positive significant moderating effects on the direct relationship between social networking sites and purchasing decision process, while education had a negative significant effect. The results also indicated particular roles of certain social networking sites, like YouTube, and the fact that females prefer Snapchat over other digital platforms.

"Online retailers often recommend new products to consumers. The present study examined the influence of regulatory fit on consumers' click-through intentions of new products recommended by online retailers. We proposed that regulatory fit resulting from aligning the product's regulatory focus and recommendation message's regulatory orientation positively influences click-through intention of new product recommendations. In a laboratory study (Study 1), we found that regulatory fit increase consumers' click-through behaviors of new product recommendations. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 in a controlled online experiment and found support for regulatory fit-click-through intentions relationship. Study 3 found that regulatory fit increases click-through intentions for new products but not for existing products. Study 4 supported the mediating role of perceived efficacy and boundary condition of consumer innovativeness in the relationship between regulatory fit and click-through intentions.

"Many consumer decisions are assisted by product recommendations. When retailers provide such recommendations, there is an inherent tension between (1) presenting a set of products that are close in attractiveness (fine product set granularity) and (2) presenting a wider range of products that are more different in attractiveness (coarse product set granularity). While the former can maximize the attractiveness of the recommended set of products, the latter makes it easier for consumers to determine which of the recommended products is most attractive, thus boosting consumer response. Evidence from a large-scale field study (with naturally occurring variation in the granularity of online recommendation sets) provides strong support for this tension and shows that less fine-grained product recommendation sets promote consumer response. We also find that, in line with our theorizing, coarser set granularity increases the time consumers spend processing detailed information about individual products relative to time they spend comparing products at the set level. These effects are less pronounced when consumer engagement in the decision process is low. The key insights from the field study are replicated in a tightly controlled experiment (using a different product domain). The findings of this research have important implications for how best to integrate large online assortments and product recommendations to stimulate consumer response.","Tsekouras, D; Dellaert, BGC; Donkers, B; Häubl, G",Tactical,10.1007/s11747-019-00682-6,Product recommendations; Product set granularity; Online assortments; Consumer response; Consumer decision-making,5.0,,25,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the fine and coarse granularity of product recommendations, which relates to how strategic goals (improving consumer response) are operationalized through structured decisions about recommendation sets.

"Analysing the performance of new product development (NPD) processes requires the reliable assessment of non-documented organizational characteristics. Based on key informant literature we discuss the difficulties of gaining reliable information from respondents and we identify potential sources for heterogeneous perceptions among different respondents. We assume that NPD research may be subject to response biases, if it is based on sole informants only. We apply an existing benchmarking approach for NPD processes in a comprehensive case study in order to illustrate sources and effects of single informant biases We find that perceptions differ substantially among the individual respondents. In particular, we observe different functional perceptions between respondents from Marketing and Research and Development. The results are consistent with expectations from interface theory, these perceptual differences have a severe impact on the managerial conclusions drawn from benchmarking. There appears to be no single reliable source of information within an organization. Furthermore, variances among informants' assessments should be recognized and regarded as valuable information. It is our recommendation that multiple informants ought to be included in future NPD research and benchmarking studies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Purpose The number of studies on the use of choice cues in the purchase decision of a smartphone does not appear to be extensive, given the size and rate of growth of the market. Surprisingly, it appears that no study of this type in the Chinese context has been undertaken. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach Best-Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important.

"The presence of international students is a valuable input for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) at all levels. Thus, it is critical to understand not only how students make their decisions and what factors and sources of information provided by the HEI most influence them, but also to evaluate students' satisfaction and loyalty with the choice made, in order to define the most suitable and competitive marketing strategies to attract and retain international students. Based on the information gathered through a questionnaire with a sample of 190 international students studying at a Portuguese HEI, a quantitative, cross-sectional and causal study was conducted using the estimation of a structural equation model calculated through PLS, in order to investigate the impact of choice factors and information sources on international students' loyalty, mediated by satisfaction with the choice made. The findings indicate that the choice factors with the greatest impact on satisfaction of the international students were: the perception of the country, the environment and location of the HEI, and the sources of information provided by the HEI. It was also concluded that a positive global perception of the HEI influences the recommendation from significant others, and increases the satisfaction and loyalty of all the international students.

"Customers acquired through a referral program have been observed to exhibit higher margins and lower churn than customers acquired through other means. Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program. Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer-referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.","Van den Bulte, C; Bayer, E; Skiera, B; Schmitt, P",Tactical,10.1509/jmr.14.0653,customer referral programs; customer relationship marketing; referral marketing; social networks; word-of-mouth marketing,5.0,,10,0,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"The study provides actionable insights for improving customer acquisition through referral programs, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",wos-recommendation,15,70,How Customer Referral Programs Turn Social Capital into Economic Capital,2018
"This article examines the interplay of social and temporal distance on consumers' responses to others' recommendations. Drawing on research on psychological distance and the fit literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. Instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance.

"With the advancement of technological platforms, the use of recommendation agents that can provide highly customisable solutions has become more ubiquitous. Marketing academics and practitioners alike have begun to investigate various communication styles and functionality designs of such decision aid systems. One variant of a design of a recommendation agent is to imbue it with humanlike features (i.e. to anthropomorphise it). However, academic research is silent with respect to whether this type of design would lead to more favourable consumer evaluations. To fill this gap, our research investigates the downstream consequences of anthropomorphising a recommendation agent, when the recommendation itself may require the exchange of personally sensitive information, and the message is customised. The results of two experiments reveal that, when a message is customised, the effect of an anthropomorphised recommendation agent on attitude towards the advertisement is predominantly negative and is mediated by consumers' unwillingness to provide personal information to an anthropomorphic recommendation agent, as well as by greater psychological resistance towards the advertisement. Our research concludes with theoretical and practical implications, as well as further research directions.","Puzakova, M; Rocereto, JF; Kwak, H",Tactical,10.2501/IJA-32-4-513-538,,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The research focuses on the design and functionality of recommendation agents, particularly how anthropomorphism affects consumer attitudes.

"The importance of customer engagement behaviors (CEBs) has been widely acknowledged in marketing. CEB encompasses an interactive relationship with the engaged object. A customer's personality characteristics play an important role in the interactive process. So it is necessary to examine how customer's personality characteristics influence customer engagement behaviors. However, there has been relatively less empirical research examining the impact of a customer's personality characteristics on CEBs. Customer goal orientation (promotion orientation vs. prevention orientation) is one such important personality characteristic. This research examined how customer goal orientation influenced CEBs. We used a priming technique to examine the relationships between the customer's state goal orientation and the customer's recommendations and complaints in study 1. The results showed that customers with state promotion-focused goal orientations initiated more recommendations than the customers with state prevention-focused goal orientations. For complaints, the difference between these two groups was not significant. Study 2 investigated the impact of trait goal orientation on the customer's recommendations and complaints. The results showed that the trait promotion-focused goal orientation customers were more likely to initiate both recommendations and complaints behaviors than the trait prevention-focused goal orientation customers. The findings of the research demonstrate that customer goal orientation is an important influence on positive and negative CEBs, and state and trait goal orientations have different impacts on CEBs. This research helps companies aiming to improve their customers' CEBs by suggesting which type of customers (in terms of goal orientation) are more likely to engage.

"This study proposes a decision support framework to help e-commerce companies select the best collaborative filtering algorithms (CF) for generating recommendations on the basis of online binary purchase data. To create this framework, an experimental design applies several CF configurations, which are characterized by different data-reduction techniques, CF methods, and similarity measures, to binary purchase data sets with distinct input data characteristics, i.e., sparsity level, purchase distribution, and item-user ratio. The evaluations in terms of accuracy, diversity, computation time, and trade-offs among these metrics reveal that the best-performing algorithm in terms of accuracy remains consistent regardless of the input-data characteristics. However, for diversity and computation time, the best-performing model varies with the input characteristics.

"Personalized recommendation algorithms inadvertently foster filter bubbles, wherein consumers are predominantly exposed to information that aligns with their existing preferences, limiting their exposure to novel items. This phenomenon raises ethical concerns regarding consumer well-being, as it potentially compromises the quality of consumption decisions by reinforcing a homogeneity of information. Introducing novelty into recommendation systems is a viable strategy to counteract this issue, as the predominance of homogeneous information plays a crucial role in the formation of filter bubbles. However, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding self-directed strategies for consumers to break through these filter bubbles. Grounded in social identification theory and utilizing a series of experimental studies, our research employs a range of analytical techniques, including ANOVA, mediation, and moderated-mediation analysis. Our findings suggest that personalized recommendations of unmentionable products, defined as products eliciting disgust, offense, or anger due to delicacy, ethics, or fear, (vs. ordinary products) can increase consumers' novelty-seeking by enhancing their motivation to change their implicit social labels given by intelligent recommendation systems. Nonetheless, we observe that this drive for novelty-seeking diminishes during social-focused recommendations because this recommendation is based on the behaviors of others in consumers' social networks rather than their actions.","Lv, LX; Kang, KQ; Liu, GR",Tactical,10.1002/mar.22057,filter bubbles; identity management; novelty-seeking; personalized recommendations; unmentionable products,5.0,,25,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses personalized recommendation algorithms and how they can be adjusted to counteract filter bubbles, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Shopping convenience can be turned into a competitive advantage for online grocery retailers. Consequently, we study how personalized product recommendations (recommendation agents) and price promotions (algorithmic pricing) compensate for the negative impact that consumer's perceived cognitive effort causes on loyalty. By default, the relationship from perceived cognitive efforts to attitudinal and behavioral loyalty is negative, yet these results demonstrate that personalized price promotions lessen the negative impact, while personalized product recommendations do not have such an influence.

"Many policies - on the delivery of inputs or on marketing systems, credit, or extension-influence the potential utilization of new technologies. Through 'farm-based policy analysis' it is possible to use data generated in on-farm research (OFR) to identify policy constraints to the use of new technologies, and to effectively communicate that information to policy makers. This paper describes a tentative framework for farm-based policy analysis and suggests a sequence of five steps for the analysis: (1) identify the policy-induced constraints; (2) determine the rationale behind the policy; (3) identify the decision makers to whom the results should be communicated; (4) identify solutions or policy options; and (5) communicate results to decision makers. A case of farm-based policy analysis from Haiti illustrates the concepts and methods described in the first part of the paper. On-farm experiments in Les Cayes, Haiti, confirmed a response to nitrogen in maize, but adoption of the recommended practice and consequent gains in productivity and income were constrained by the scarcity of urea in the local market. An analysis of local supply and potential local demand for urea and the potential benefits of urea application was conducted, and results communicated to two target groups of decision makers: representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for fertilizer distribution policy, and representatives of private fertilizer enterprises. These groups responded by making larger supplies of urea available to local farmers. Adoption of the fertilizer recommendation and urea sales increased. The case demonstrates the potential value of farm-based policy analysis building upon data from OFR.","MARTINEZ, JC; SAIN, G; YATES, M",Tactical,10.1016/0169-5150(91)90045-M,,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"The abstract outlines a framework for farm-based policy analysis that addresses specific constraints and decision-making processes related to the adoption of new agricultural technologies.

"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.","Lambrecht, A; Tucker, C",Tactical,10.1509/jmr.11.0503,retargeting; online advertising; field experiments; online decision process; construal level theory,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of dynamic retargeted ads versus generic ads, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Purpose-Research on choice overload with adult participants has shown that the presence of a brand significantly mitigates the phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether these findings can be expanded to a population of adolescents, where it has already been shown that choice overload occurs in a similar way as adults. Design/methodology/approach-Studies 1 and 2 aim to test whether the presence of a brand name mitigates the adverse consequences of choice overload in adolescents. In line with prior research on choice overload, in both studies, the authors compared between-subjects differences in the levels of reported dissatisfaction, difficulty and regret in a choice condition where adolescents chose among either 6 or 24 options associated with brand names and in another choice condition where adolescents chose among the same 6 or 24 options but not associated with brand names. Findings-This paper presents evidence from two studies that when facing either a large or a small amount of choice options that are associated with brand names, choice overload disappears among adolescents. Conversely, when no brands are associated to the choice options, adolescents report choice overload, that is a greater dissatisfaction, difficulties and regret with larger (versus smaller) assortments. Practical implications-Prior research on choice overload has led to recommendations that marketers and other choice architects should simply reduce choice options or assortments to improve consumers' satisfaction. However, our finding suggests that this recommendation may be invalidated when brands are present, at least for certain age groups. Adolescents cope indeed very well with large assortments of branded products. Originality/value-The research adds to the existing understanding of choice overload, demonstrating that the brand is a moderator of the phenomenon for adolescents, who currently represent a large portion of the market. A second important contribution of this work is that it extends prior research on choice overload to real-world consumer scenarios, where consumers choose among products with a brand, rather than among products described only by technical characteristics or nutritional values, as in classical studies on choice overload.","Misuraca, R; Ceresia, F; Nixon, AE; Abbate, CS",Tactical,10.1108/JCM-08-2020-4021,Brands; Adolescents; Decision-making; Choice overload,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study investigates the effects of brand presence on choice overload among adolescents, which has implications for marketing strategies and consumer behavior in a structured manner.",wos-recommendation,10,70,When is more really more?

"The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Surveys are used as the research instrument, and the hypotheses are tested with a between-subjects experimental design. One case of mandatory disclosure and one case of non-mandatory disclosure are compared in the research. Findings The results indicate that the disclosure of sales compensations is significantly associated with the subjective norms from the official authority and perceived behavioral control (PBC). The results of this study also indicate that, when the disclosure is mandatory, the PBC has a stronger effect on the insurance brokers' intention to make biased product recommendations than dose the attitude and subjective norms. When the disclosure is non-mandatory, however, the subjective norms have a stronger effect on the insurance brokers' intention.

"By integrating theories of media richness, presence, perceive risk, flow, and social presence into the S-O-R paradigm, this study develops a theoretical model that extends previous research to explain how the virtual presence generated by a web store affects consumers' internal psychological states and final purchase behavior. The experimental results show that (1) the richness of website features (multiplicity of cues and immediacy of feedback) positively influences consumers' perceptions of website telepresence (cognitive experience) and social presence (affective experience). (2) Telepresence can significantly increase consumer purchase intention by reducing perceived website risk and increasing perceived product diagnosis. (3) Social presence can significantly increase consumers' purchase intention by increasing perceived product diagnostics and perceived social approval.

"Referral bonuses, in which an existing customer gets an in-kind or cash reward for referring a new customer, are a popular way to stimulate word of mouth. In this paper, we examine key firm decisions about such bonuses. Others have studied referral bonus programs; a key difference is that we study the role of recommendations not just in spreading awareness (as they do) but also in providing assessments. We start with the idea that people have a variety of reasons for making product recommendations, including placing a value on a friend's outcome with a product they recommend. We apply that idea in a context of asymmetric information: A customer combines his knowledge about the product and his familiarity with friends' tastes, making him more informed than the friends. Thus, the recommendation is a signal about the value of the product to the friend. In this setting, we consistently find that the greater the concern for others' outcomes, the higher the referral bonus should be, as long as the firm cannot more efficiently motivate recommendations with a lower price. Moreover, if price is the more efficient lever, the optimal bonus is zero, and the optimal price is low. We also show that greater concern tends to reduce firm profit and, in some cases, actually reduces consumer welfare as well.","Kornish, LJ; Li, QP",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1080.0484,word of mouth; reward programs; pricing,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the implementation of referral bonus programs and the optimization of such programs, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that translate strategic goals into structured actions like customer acquisition and sales promotion.",wos-recommendation,15,65,Optimal Referral Bonuses with Asymmetric Information: Firm-Offered and Interpersonal Incentives,2010
"Background: In this study, qualitative research methods were used to explore the behavioral, normative, and control beliefs underpinning parents' decisions to purchase functional weaning food products. Methods: Seven focus groups were conducted with 44 parents in two locations in Malaysia (Sabah and Selangor). Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior theoretical framework, participants were prompted with questions about commercial weaning foods including functional weaning foods and shown several different products to stimulate discussion. Results: Important behavioral beliefs (product attributes, babies' needs and suitability of the product, perceived healthiness), referrals and influences (family and friends' opinions and experiences, internet and social media influence, health professionals' recommendation and advice) and facilitating and inhibiting factors (trust and confidence, brand and cost, and product availability and options) were identified. Conclusions: Overall functional weaning food purchase intention was influenced positively and negatively by behavioral, normative and control beliefs. To increase the awareness and commercial product knowledge on weaning food are suitable for their children, more information on functional weaning food products from reliable sources that can reach the parents and other potential customers is needed.

"With the increasing popularity of product assortments by recommender system, it becomes increasingly important for online platform and sellers to investigate their economic impact and manage the links of products. Different from the previous product network, this study constructs and investigates the role of similarity product network from similar products' recommender system by using data from Taobao.com. The characters of similarity product network exhibits influence on product demand. Mining of similar product's link reveals that the more a product is being linked, the greater of the demand, the impact of product's degree is different from type of products. In addition, the results show that the centralization of network has a negative impact on focal product's demand. This study also examines the spillover effect of similar products' reviews (UGC) as well as similar products' description (MGC), especially focuses on the semantic similarity. The results reveal that the semantic similarity of recommended product's reviews and products' description have negative spillover effect on demand. The more similar of recommended product's reviews and the product's description, the stronger the effect. Specifically, similarity of MGC exhibits a stronger impact than that of UGC on focal product's demand for search goods than for experience goods. The findings provide insights to marketing practitioners by helping understand the effects of similarity and link of product on the consumer's decision.","Huang, HJ; Yang, J; Zheng, BR",Tactical,10.1007/s10660-019-09352-9,Product similarity network; Semantic similarity; User generated content; Market generated content; Spillover effect,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the investigation of the economic impact of product assortments and the role of similarity in product networks, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on structured targets and optimization strategies for marketing and sales.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Demand effects of product similarity network in e-commerce platform,2021
"Purpose The purpose of this study is two-fold: classifying non-Muslim halal fashion buyers by applying quantitative techniques and identifying the persuading determinants of the non-Muslim women' halal fashion buying behaviour (HFBB). Design/methodology/approach By adapting items from prior studies, a structured questionnaire was developed and distributed face-to-face to various Muslim fashion stores in Malaysia. After a one-month effort, 221 responses were obtained from non-Muslim consumers by using convenience sampling. Next, a clustering analysis was used to classify them from a contrasting perspective. Finally, regression and Andrew F. Hayes's process procedures were applied to examine the three independent variables' effect and the moderating variables. Findings The results revealed the characteristic behaviour of the non-Muslim women explicitly, which is related to their halal fashion purchasing decision. Based on the ANOVA results, there were different motives for buying halal fashion by non-Muslim women. Additionally, it was found that the most crucial determinants for non-Muslim's HFBB are cultural adaptation, albeit, there is no substantial proof of a significant moderating effect of age and income on the consumers. Research limitations/implications These discoveries are advantageous for halal fashion retailers and provide an appealing domain for further investigations in the context of the global halal study.

"Individuals often have a need to predict the preferences of others (e.g., offering a recommendation, gift giving). In doing so, it is not uncommon that individuals project their attitudes and preferences onto others. Extant consumer research literature related to social projection focuses largely on particular situational variables that influence social projection. The current research adds to a smaller body of consumer research which focuses on specific characteristics of consumers' selves that may drive an individual's tendency to project his/her attitudes onto others. Specifically, the present paper explores an individual-level moderator of social projection, namely, interpersonal attachment style. Across five studies, interpersonal attachment style, and attachment anxiety, specifically, is shown to influence social projection. In addition, the mechanism underlying this relationship is demonstrated. The results show that high (vs. low) anxious attachment individuals tend to naturally consider more counter-valence attributes of a product, that is., liked attributes of a disliked product and disliked attributes of a liked product, and this availability of counter-valence attributes lowers social projection. Important theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","David, ME",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21080,attachment anxiety; attachment theory; counter-valence attributes; interpersonal attachment styles; social projection,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The research focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes related to social projection and interpersonal attachment styles.

"Purpose - This paper aims to introduce brand identity (BI) fit as an important factor that influences co-branding success. Based on motivated reasoning theory, the authors propose consumer-brand (C-B) identification moderates the effect of BI fit on co-branding attitudes. In addition, they investigate the role of consumer coping and perceived BI fit on consumers' attitude toward co-branding. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were conducted to test the research hypotheses. Findings - Study 1 results reveal that when C-B identification is low, consumers' co-branding evaluations and the loyalty of the focal brand are higher in the low BI fit condition than those in the high BI fit condition. When C-B identification is high, such effects are not observed. Study 2 results reveal that when the BI fit is low, decoupling is more effective than biased assimilation at defending the positive evaluations of the focal brand. Research limitations/implications - First, while the authors focus particularly on BI fit, it may be fruitful for marketers to combine BI fit with other types of fit such as functional dimension fit and product category fit. For example, while the results suggest marketers should co-brand with low BI fit pairs when targeting at low C-B identification consumers, this recommendation should be taken in conjunction with how consumers respond to other co-branding fit strategies. Second, the authors encourage future researchers to explore deeper into the consumer coping in other contexts. As these elements are critical to consumers' attitudes, it will be beneficial to see how decoupling or biased assimilation strategies differ in other co-branding fit contexts. Practical implications - The authors advise marketers to consider both the level of BI fit and the level of C-B identification when looking for a co-brand partner. When targeting low C-B identification consumers, it is better for marketers to find a co-branding partner with a low BI fit than high BI fit. This is a counterintuitive finding given that higher fit (e. g. product category fit and brand image fit) is often associated with positive evaluations. For high C-B identification consumers, BI fit does not adversely affect consumer attitudes (and loyalty). Thus, these consumers are safer targets for marketers in terms of maintaining attitudes. Second, the authors find that when perceived BI fit is low, decoupling strategy is more effective than biased assimilation strategy at defending the positive evaluations of the focal brand. However, when perceived BI fit is high, the two coping strategies have little difference in influencing co-branding attitudes. Thus, the authors advise marketers to encourage their consumers to cope using a decoupling strategy to garner higher attitudes. Originality/value - The authors introduce BI fit as an important abstract dimension of brand image fit when facing co-branding decisions. Overall, our results demonstrate C-B identification moderates the effects of BI fit on co-branding attitudes. Counter-intuitively, the results suggest that low BI fit co-branding can also generate higher attitudes depending on consumers' level of brand identification. Moreover, marketers must also be wary of how consumers cope with co-branding, as coping explains the underlying mechanism of how consumers deal with high or low perceived BI fit. Specifically, our findings suggest that consumer coping moderates the relationship between perceived BI fit and co-branding attitudes.","Xiao, N; Lee, SH",Tactical,10.1108/EJM-02-2012-0075,Brand identity fit; Co-branding; Consumer coping; Consumer-brand identification,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,"The abstract discusses specific strategies for co-branding based on brand identity fit and consumer-brand identification, which align with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"With the emergence of content-driven social commerce, designing marketing content that better stimulates consumer purchase behaviors has become increasingly essential. However, it remains unclear what and how linguistic features of marketing content in emerging social commerce influence consumer purchase behaviors. Drawing on speech act theory, this paper proposes a multi-level research model to conceptualize the linguistic features of content from the aspects of word usage (micro level), within-content argument development (macro level), and between-content linguistic mimicry (meta level), and investigate their impact on consumer purchase behaviors. With a unique dataset that includes 44,256 textual posts from JD WeChat shopping circle (a content -driven social commerce platform), this paper combines text mining methods with a series of regression analyses to test the research model. The empirical analyses find that the number of customers who make a purchase increases 1) at the micro-level due to self-referencing and detailing, 2) at the macro-level due to argument structuring, and 3) at the meta-level due to linguistic style matching, while linguistic content matching nega-tively affects the number of customers. These findings reveal how content creators strategically use language to design marketing content that encourages consumer purchase behaviors in emerging social commerce.

"The World Wide Web contains a vast corpus of consumer-generated content that holds invaluable insights for improving the product and service offerings of firms. Yet the typical method for extracting diagnostic information from online content-text mining-has limitations. As a starting point, we propose analyzing a sample of comments before initiating text mining. Using a combination of real data and simulations, we demonstrate that a sampling procedure that selects respondents whose comments contain a large amount of information is superior to the two most popular sampling methods-simple random sampling and stratified random sampling-in gaining insights from the data. In addition, we derive a method that determines the probability of observing diagnostic information repeated a specific number of times in the population, which will enable managers to base sample size decisions on the trade-off between obtaining additional diagnostic information and the added expense of a larger sample.

"The Web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions (more specifically, consumer reviews) about products. Consumer reviews are essential for retailers and product manufacturers to understand the general responses of customers to their products and improve their marketing campaigns or products accordingly. In addition, consumer reviews enable retailers to recognize the specific preferences of each customer, which facilitates effective marketing decisions. As the number of consumer reviews expands, it is essential and desirable to develop an efficient and effective sentiment analysis technique that is capable of extracting product features stated in consumer reviews (i.e., product feature extraction) and determining the sentiments (positive or negative semantic orientations) of consumers for these product features (i.e., opinion orientation identification). Product feature extraction is critical to sentiment analysis, because its effectiveness significantly affects the performance of opinion orientation identification, as well as the ultimate effectiveness of sentiment analysis. Therefore, this study concentrates on product feature extraction from consumer reviews. Specifically, we propose a semantic-based product feature extraction (SPE) technique that exploits a list of positive and negative adjectives defined in the General Inquirer to recognize opinion words semantically and subsequently extract product features expressed in consumer reviews. Using a prevalent product feature extraction technique and the SPE-GI technique (a variant of SPE) as performance benchmarks, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed SPE technique outperforms both benchmark techniques.","Wei, CP; Chen, YM; Yang, CS; Yang, CC",Tactical,10.1007/s10257-009-0113-9,Consumer review; Sentiment analysis; Product feature extraction; Opinion summarization; Text mining,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"The abstract discusses the development of a sentiment analysis technique for extracting product features from consumer reviews, which relates to specific marketing activities and decisions.

A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.","Ludwig, S; de Ruyter, K; Friedman, M; Brüggen, EC; Wetzels, M; Pfann, G",Tactical,10.1509/jm.11.0560,online customer reviews; affective content; linguistic style match; conversion rate; Internet marketing,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the influence of customer reviews on conversion rates and provides actionable insights for managers to optimize review strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into targets and structured decisions.",wos-text mining,10,70,More Than Words: The Influence of Affective Content and Linguistic Style Matches in Online Reviews on Conversion Rates,2013
"Online customer reviews play a vital role in evaluating product or service performance and serve as an important reference for other customers' purchase decisions. This study explores the influence of online customer reviews on sustainable clothing purchase intention through text mining and survey-based methodologies. The results showed that online customer reviews focused on four dimensions: material ecology, clothing fashion, clothing functionality, and price reasonableness. Online customer reviews have a positive impact on consumers' sustainable purchase intentions, and perceived diagnosticity mediates the relationship between online customer reviews and purchase intentions. In addition, customers' prior sustainability knowledge moderates the relationship between material ecology, price reasonableness, and perceived diagnosticity. This study further enriches theoretical research on sustainable consumption within the context of online apparel retailing and helps sustainable apparel brands more accurately grasp the influencing variables of customers' sustainable consumption behaviours and formulate precise electronic word-of-mouth marketing strategies.","Huang, CH; Chen, CH; Wang, HJ",Tactical,10.1002/cb.2344,,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The study explores how online customer reviews influence consumers' sustainable purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into specific targets for marketing strategies.",wos-text mining,10,70,Effects of online customer reviews on sustainable clothing purchase intentions: The mediating role of perceived diagnosticity,2024
"We develop a model that examines the role of content, content-user fit, and influence on social media rebroadcasting behavior. While previous research has studied the role of content or the role of influence in the spread of social media content separately, none has simultaneously examined both in an effort to assess the relative effects of each. Our modeling approach also accounts for a message's fit with users, based on the content of the message and the content of messages typically shared by users. As an empirical application, we examine how Twitter posts originating from top business schools are subsequently rebroadcasted (or retweeted) by other users. We employ an individual-level split hazard model that accounts for variation in rebroadcasting decisions related to (1) content, (2) the content-user fit and (3) the influence of other users. We find that the rebroadcasting a message depends not only on message content but also on the message's fit with a user. Our analysis also yields measures of influence and susceptibility to influence for each user, which can be used to identify influential social media users. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to evaluate different types of seeding strategies designed to increase the reach of social media messages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Consumers increasingly rely on online reviews to make their purchase decisions. Drawing from linguistics and sociology research, the authors posit that comparative reviews, which highlight the similarities and differences between a focal product and its alternatives, may influence consumers' regulation systems and perceived credibility, thereby affecting product sales. The authors examined 61,480 reviews on e-commerce platforms to explore the effects of comparative reviews and their valence on product sales. By using a supervised learning approach, they identified positive and negative comparative reviews, as well as positive and negative regular reviews, and then applied a two-way fixed-effects model. The results show that comparative reviews positively impacted product sales. Specifically, positive comparative reviews had a greater effect than positive regular reviews, whereas negative comparative reviews had a lesser absolute effect than negative regular reviews on product sales. Moreover, positive comparative reviews exerted a greater absolute effect than negative ones. A follow-up controlled lab study further substantiated the authors' results and insights. The findings offer new insights and practical guidance for marketers and practitioners in promoting more comparative review posts and optimizing online review presentations.","Zhang, M; Li, YZ; Sun, L; Wang, GA; Du, JA",Tactical,10.1177/10949968231196578,comparative reviews; product sales; attribution theory; online reviews; text mining,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the impact of comparative reviews on product sales, which aligns with tactical decisions that interpret strategic marketing goals into actionable insights for improving marketing effectiveness.",wos-text mining,10,70,The Effects of Comparative Reviews on Product Sales,2024
"Opinions published online about a given experience are known to influence consumers' decisions. However, such opinions reflect different degrees of engagement which may affect the decisions in different forms. The aim of this study is to analyze the dimensions of online customer engagement and associated concepts (involvement, emotional states, experience and brand advocacy) in customers' online reviews through text-mining and sentiment analysis trends. The current study focuses on Yelp.com comments and includes a random sample of 15,000 unique reviews of restaurants, hotels and nightlife entertainment in eleven cities in the USA. A customer engagement dictionary is created, based on previously validated scales and extended using WordNet 2.1. The research findings reveal a high impact of the engagement cognitive processing dimension and hedonic experience on customers' review endeavor. Results further indicate that customers seem to be more engaged in positively advocating a company/brand than the contrary. Companies that listen to such feedback may be more able to align with consumers' expectations and, therefore, have a better competitive advantage in the market.","Bilro, RG; Loureiro, SMC; Guerreiro, J",Tactical,10.1080/19368623.2018.1506375,Customer engagement; online experience; involvement; brand advocacy; emotional states; user-generated content,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The study focuses on analyzing online customer engagement and its dimensions through text-mining and sentiment analysis, which aligns with structured marketing activities that interpret strategic goals into tangible targets.",wos-text mining,10,70,"Exploring online customer engagement with hospitality products and its relationship with involvement, emotional states, experience and brand advocacy",2019
"Opinion dynamics investigate the spreading and evolution of opinions among a set of individuals. This is especially relevant in decision-making — the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options —, that is commonly based on personal opinions which may evolve along time. In this work, we present a model of opinion dynamics where opinions are represented using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples, a realistic representation of imprecise information. In our framework, the propagation of opinions in the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes. Additionally, we use a social network to represent agents’ interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). Our opinion dynamics model can be easily integrated into an agent-based system to how opinions spread and evolve. Experimental results show the impact of the communication processes, the social network topology, the awareness deactivation mechanism, and the agents’ influence on the opinion dynamics of others. Furthermore, we present two case studies of our opinion dynamics model applied to marketing and politics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Giráldez-Cru J.; Chica M.; Cordón O.,Tactical,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107559,Agent-based models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples; Opinion dynamics; Social networks,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract presents a model of opinion dynamics that can be applied to specific domains such as marketing and politics, indicating a structured approach to decision-making based on evolving opinions.

"In an effort to understand how different types of food cues in food ads are automatically encouraging unhealthy eating behaviors, the current study examined how the presence of actual food consumption behaviors (use cues) and presence of multiple individuals indorsing food products (social cues) in fast food ads would influence individual attentional and behavioral responses. A use cue (2) x social cue (2) x repetition (3) fully within-subjects factorial design experiment with young adults (N = 164) was conducted. Findings demonstrated that participants paid greater attention to the fast food ads which contained multiple people (group cue) eating the advertised food products (use cue) when compared to other types of fast food ads. In addition, participants also self-reported greater social support and purchase intention when seeing use and group cues in ads. Understanding how these cues function in food advertising to encourage unhealthy eating may help health practitioners and individuals create more helpful intervention strategies. Further, applying these marketing tactics to ads for food products that are healthier (i.e., less energy dense and more nutrient dense) may help to maximize healthy food palatability, thereby increasing motivation for viewers to make autonomous decisions about eating healthier. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Liu J.; Bailey R.L.,Tactical,10.1080/10410236.2019.1654174,,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study explores how specific cues in fast food advertisements influence consumer behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing to optimize ad strategies and improve engagement.

"We analyze the changes in the management of corporate communication due to the influence of new technologies, using as a case study the market of advertising agencies in the Autonomous Community of Aragon (Spain). In order to determine if the gender of those in management positions of the advertisers influences the way of managing the new business environment, a descriptive analysis was carried out using the focus group as a research technique. As a study variable, gender was selected, so two different sessions were held, one with men and the other with women, in order to analyze the characteristics of the advertiser vs. agency relationship. The main conclusion we reached in this research is that there is a different interest for men and women in relation to the different parameters of analysis. While men paid more attention to external competitiveness and the need to react quickly and forcefully to changes, women were more concerned about the disappearance of interdepartmental borders and the way marketing decisions are made. © 2018 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada.

"Purpose: Under the big data background, there are many influencing factors for investors of new energy vehicles (NEV), and government subsidies promote the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to provide solutions for the sustainable development of NEV. Design/methodology/approach: The sustainable marketing strategy of NEV in China is put forward. This paper first analyzes the subsidy policy effect of NEV under the background of big data. It then establishes the online optimal leasing strategy under multiple strategy choices and the online leasing strategy of multiple vehicles under the inflation market. Findings: With the fixed cost of NEV in each lease period, the optimal competition ratio of online decision-makers will continue to decrease with the increase of the difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies. In the decision-making of renting and purchasing multiple vehicles, the general strategy competition ratio is 2.922, while the optimal competition ratio of the online renting and purchasing strategy proposed by the research is 2.723. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the limited data and information collected, so the optimal decision-making model has some limitations. The authors need to find more representative data to optimize the model. Practical implications: As an emerging industry, NEV have developed rapidly in recent years. Based on the online algorithm and competitive ratio theory, this paper solves the decision-making problem of operators and gives the optimal strategy to promote the green development of the new energy vehicle industry. Originality/value: This paper proposes the optimal strategy for online investors of new energy vehicle operators by combining online algorithm and competitive ratio theory. The numerical analysis results of the optimal online model under multi strategy selection show that with the same difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies, the time point will be delayed and the time point will be advanced as the cost of leasing NEV in each period increases. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Daifen T.,Tactical,10.1108/JEIM-02-2021-0087,Big data; Big data economy; Competitive ratio; Lease-purchase model; New energy vehicles; Online algorithm,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the establishment of optimal leasing strategies and competition ratios for new energy vehicles, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into structured, actionable plans.",scopus-big data,20,60,Evaluate the sustainable marketing strategy to optimal online leasing of new energy vehicles under the background big data economy,2022

"The increased availability of social media big data has created a unique challenge for marketing decision-makers; turning this data into useful information. One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers.

"Online lifestyles have been shown to reflect and affect consumers’ preferences across a wide range of online scenarios. In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole.

"A persona is a widely used tool in the design field to help understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. Quantitatively creating personas is gaining importance for its greater representability, objectivity, and fast creative speed. However, quantitative personas built using traditional statistical methods may not reflect the marketing goals of decision-makers, and they mainly focus on categorizing existing users rather than predicting target customers. To address the research gap, this study proposes a guideline to create a predictive persona by using data-mining algorithms resulting in personas that can be validated. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and credibility of personas to effectively predict new customers for target marketing. We demonstrate a step-by-step guideline for creating the proposed predictive persona using real user data, validating its credibility, and comparing its predictive power against traditional quantitative personas.

With a growing amount of big data available, fashion retailers need to innovate and develop more sophisticated analytics for new consumer behaviours such as m-commerce. This research has considered how Google Analytics data can be applied to develop customer journey maps to understand digital consumer behaviour. A multi-method research design was used, incorporating an innovative mobile eye tracking technology and mobile fashion consumer data from Google Analytics. Digital customers’ shopping journeys on the fashion retailer's website were mapped using data sourced from eye tracking and Google Analytics, gathered in parallel. The comparison of these shopping journeys allowed a critical evaluation of the precision and usefulness of the Google Analytics database. Google Analytics tracked only half of the digital users’ activities, whereas eye tracking data documented digital consumers’ interaction with all elements of the fashion retailer's website.

"With the rise of machine learning and ""big data,""many large yet spurious relationships between variables are discovered, leveraged by marketing communications, and publicized in the media. Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to many large-magnitude relationships between variables that do not signal causal effects. This exposure may carry a substantial cost. Seven studies demonstrate that the magnitudes of relationships between variables can distort consumers' judgments about whether those relationships reflect causal effects. Specifically, consumers often use a magnitude heuristic: consumers infer that relationships with larger perceived magnitudes are more likely to reflect causal effects, even when this is not true (and even when relationships' correlations are held constant). In many situations, relying on the magnitude heuristic will distort causality judgments, such as when large-magnitude relationships between variables are spurious, or when normatively extraneous factors (e.g., reference points) distort perceptions of magnitudes. Moreover, magnitude-distorted (mis)perceptions of causality, in turn, distort consumers' purchase and consumption decisions. Since consumers often encounter spurious relationships with large magnitudes in the health domain and in other consequential domains, the magnitude heuristic is likely to lead to biases in some of consumers' most important decisions.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"The sophistication of political campaigns has dramatically increased over recent election cycles through the embracing of big data analytics. Collecting and storing information on actual and potential voters, volunteers, and donors has produced extensive databases that are then used to guide microtargeting efforts related to advertising, organizing, and fundraising efforts. But building, maintaining, and analyzing this data are costly in itself. This paper looks at two aspects of data-driven political fundraising: precision and selectiveness, with respect to the alignment of the ideology of potential donors and the ideology of the candidate. Specifically, the proposed model is used to determine the optimal precision in estimating a donor’s location on the political ideology spectrum and the optimal targeting decision for fundraising solicitations given that estimate. Analysis of the model produces guidance for changes in solicitation cost and donation size. The results produced by the model are considered in light of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The analysis suggests that the Clinton campaign’s larger donation size likely played a greater role than did the campaign’s higher solicitation cost in terms of targeting. The model is also consistent with the Clinton campaign’s higher expenditures on analytics, given their larger donation size and solicitation cost. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Walker D.; Nowlin E.L.,Tactical,10.1080/15377857.2018.1457590,Analytics; big data; data-driven marketing; direct marketing; fundraising; microtargeting; political campaigning,5.0,,5,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses specific methods of data-driven political fundraising, focusing on precision and selectiveness in targeting potential donors, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"The collection of big data from different sources such as the internet of things, social media and search engines has created significant opportunities for business-to-business (B2B) industrial marketing organizations to take an analytical view in developing programmatic marketing approaches for online display advertising. Cleansing, processing and analyzing of such large datasets create challenges for marketing organizations — particularly for real-time decision making and comparative implications. Importantly, there is limited research for such interplays. By utilizing a problematization approach, this paper contributes through the exploration of links between big data, programmatic marketing and real-time processing and relevant decision making for B2B industrial marketing organizations that depend on big data-driven marketing or big data-savvy managers. This exploration subsequently encompasses appropriate big data sources and effective batch and real-time processing linked with structured and unstructured datasets that influence relative processing techniques.

"Nowadays, it remains unclear whether the accumulation of Internet buzz can accurately predict customer preferences and buying intentions. We study two related perspectives with regard to what people talk about online and what they intend to do in the adoption phase to offer advice to companies aiming to excel in online marketing efforts. Drawing on the consumption value theory, we examine buyers’ discussions about and intention to use wearable devices for a sample of consumers in Taiwan. A framework is advanced to explore the results of big data analysis employing text-mining techniques (i.e., what people talk about) and survey-based research using structural equation modelling (i.e., what people intend to do). Functional, emotional and conditional values surfaced as the highest Internet buzzes of wearable devices. Conversely, emotional, epistemic and functional values emerged as the most influential drivers of customers’ adoption intention. Our findings suggest that different value dimensions are relevant at different points of the purchase-related decision-making process. Some values animate Internet discussions that pertain to the pre-purchase information search stage, and others appear significant during the formation of people’s purchase intentions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and provide suggestions for future research. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Eurasia Business and Economics Society.",Chang S.-Y.; Bodolica V.; Hsu H.-H.; Lu H.-P.,Tactical,10.1007/s40821-022-00221-4,Big data; Consumption value theory; Electronic word-of-mouth; Online consumer behavior; Text mining; Wearable devices,5.0,,15,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The abstract discusses the analysis of customer preferences and buying intentions regarding wearable devices, utilizing big data and text-mining techniques.

"With the rise of social media platforms for marketing purposes, the central dilemma for researchers and policymakers lies in choosing effective data analysis tools to improve marketing decisions. In the academic literature, numerous articles have discussed clustering techniques for analysing social media data, from a perspective of data mining or social media marketing. However, few studies have attempted to synthesise results obtained from both perspectives. This research aims to (1) offer a structured overview of existing literature on clustering methods for marketing strategies and (2) compare three topic modelling techniques applied to extract the main topics evoked in the corpus of papers. Indeed, topic modelling emerges as a valuable tool for extracting relevant information from big data in general and more specifically from extensive scientific papers. Based on a thematic analysis, the extracted topics were classified according to the following categories: fields, marketing strategies and technologies. Results prove that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most effective technique in this context. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of clustering techniques and technologies used for marketing strategies in studied fields. These findings help researchers and practitioners to select the best techniques and technologies for extracting marketing knowledge from big data. © 2024 Telecommunications Association Inc..

"Think tanks and their roles in rendering expertise in policy advice have been the subject of historical and ongoing research in policy sciences. However, the widening trend of digital behaviors of think tanks in the social media era is yet to be investigated. While social media is reshaping the political ecology and challenging conventional sources of knowledge, it also serves as a potential channel for think tanks to publicly share their expertise and policy advice with the public and decision-makers, thus evolving into “digital advocators.” Based on social media big data methods, this paper has constructed two sets of new think tank indicators with “network centrality” of social media accounts and “ripple effect” of social media citations from Facebook and Twitter to capture and observe the digital activities of 207 prominent think tanks in 62 countries or regions. We have concluded that think tanks have displayed their opinion and values and increased visibility as digital advocators by spreading expertise on social media platforms with online marketing skills. With various values and ideas, social media not only is hosting massive policy advocacy activities and being an expertise spreading arena for think tanks but has also been changing the ecology of the think tank industry and expertise markets. © The Author(s) 2023.

"The success of creative products depends on the felt experience of consumers. Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades. The authors then use the components of the model for marketing decisions such as forecasting the success of new albums, conducting album tuning and diagnostics, constructing playlists for different generations of music listeners, and providing contextual recommendations. © American Marketing Association 2021.",Boughanmi K.; Ansari A.,Tactical,10.1177/00222437211016495,Bayesian nonparametrics; big data; data fusion; multimedia; music industry; product recommendations; supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses a multimodal machine learning framework aimed at predicting the success of musical albums and playlists, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Purpose: The dynamic yet volatile nature of tourism and travel industry in a competitive environment calls for enhanced marketing intelligence and analytics, especially for those entities with limited marketing budgets. The past decade has witnessed an increased use of user-generated content (UGC) analysis as a marketing tool to make better informed decisions. Likewise, textual data analysis of UGC has gained much attention among tourism and hospitality scholars. Nonetheless, most of the scholarly works have focused on the singular application of an existing method or technique rather than using a multi-method approach. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel Web analytics methodology to examine online reviews posted by tourists in real time and assist decision-makers tasked with marketing strategy and intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: For illustration, the case of tourism campaign in India was undertaken. A total of 305,298 reviews were collected, and after filtering, 276,154 reviews were qualified for analysis using a string of models. Descriptive charts, sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling and machine learning algorithms for real-time classification were applied. Findings: Using big data from TripAdvisor, a total of 145 tourist destinations were clustered based on tourists’ perceptions. Further exploration of each cluster through topic modeling was conducted, which revealed interesting insights into satisfiers and dissatisfiers of different clusters of destinations. The results supported the use of the proposed multi-method Web-analytics approach. Practical implications: The proposed machine learning model demonstrated that it could provide real-time information on the sentiments in each incoming review about a destination. This information might be useful for taking timely action for improvisation or controlling a service situation. Originality/value: In terms of Web-analytics and UGC, a comprehensive analytical model to perform an end-to-end understanding of tourist behavior patterns and offer the potential for real-time interpretation is rarely proposed. The current study not only proposes such a model but also offers empirical evidence for a successful application. It contributes to the literature by providing scholars interested in textual analytics a step-by-step guide to implement a multi-method approach. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Gour A.; Aggarwal S.; Erdem M.,Tactical,10.1108/IJCHM-07-2020-0760,India; Text analytics; Tourism; User-generated content,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a multi-method approach for analyzing user-generated content to assist decision-makers in marketing strategy, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"The application of big data targeted advertising in the green supply chain makes the green marketing of products more accurate and effective. This paper applies game theory to study the decisions and coordination issues of a green supply chain in which the online retailer conducts big data targeted advertising. A centralized model and two Stackelberg game models (an online-retailer-led decentralized model and a manufacturer-led decentralized model) were constructed and solved. The zero wholesale price-side-payment contract and greedy wholesale price-side-payment contract were introduced into the green supply chain for coordination. The study found that: (1) the increase in demand attenuation coefficient, green sensitivity coefficient, and big data targeted advertising sensitivity coefficient will be beneficial to the growth of total consumer demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit; (2) supply chain coordination is necessary because greenness, demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit under the centralized model are higher than those under two decentralized models; (3) two contracts can achieve the coordination of the green supply chain, and the profits of the manufacturer and online retailer under the contract are greater than those under the decentralized model.

"We study how risk conditions derived from the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on both the desire to travel and intention to visit of tourists and, therefore, on different stages of the destination choice process. We analyse 5134 million flight searches and 379 million flight picks during 2020 for the 17 largest European tourism source markets. An unweighted index number is employed to measure the average variation for searches and picks, for the year 2020, in relation to the reference base period (year 2019). This is done for air travel in general and to Spain specifically. The study then proceeds to conduct an analysis of 17 international travel destinations that are in the evoked sets of the two largest outbound markets in Europe (Germany and UK).

"Recent developments in blockchain technology have enabled the development of wallet applications for storing peoples’ cryptocurrency reserves. Cryptocurrency wallet applications could deploy affiliate marketing processes to increase the visibility of their products. From these affiliate marketing processes, supply chain firms in the air forwarding sector that seek to advertise their services to a larger audience could be benefited. This research examines whether affiliate marketing initials of cryptocurrency wallet applications affect their digital marketing efficiency, as well as whether air forwarding firms’ website visibility could be benefited from them. After collecting the required Web Analytic data, the authors performed statistical analysis (correlations and linear regressions), followed by Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) macroanalysis and Hybrid Modeling (HM) microanalysis to assess the outcomes of cryptocurrency wallet applications’ affiliate marketing programs. Hence, from the deployed methodology, valuable insights arose. The first part of the produced outcomes concerns the effect of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics on their digital marketing results. The increased implications of affiliate marketing metrics (referring domains, backlinks, etc.) decrease the number of pages their visitors see. Regarding the air forwarder firms’ website visibility, specific metrics (branded and referral traffic) were increased and others (social traffic) were decreased from the increment of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics (backlinks, internal links, etc.). Supply chain firms, in the air forwarding sector, could have increased website visibility by deploying advertisements and affiliate marketing initiatives with cryptocurrency wallet organizations. Summing up, specific affiliate marketing metrics of cryptocurrency wallet applications are capable of significantly impacting their digital marketing performance and also constitute determinant factors of supply chain firms’ website visibility. © 2023 by the authors.",Sakas D.P.; Giannakopoulos N.T.; Nasiopoulos D.K.; Kanellos N.; Tsoulfas G.T.,Tactical,10.3390/su15097326,big data; blockchain; Decision Support Systems (DSSs); digitalization; innovation; process optimization; strategic digital marketing; supply chain; sustainability,5.0,,5,0,MDPI,"The research examines the specific metrics and processes related to affiliate marketing for cryptocurrency wallet applications and their impact on digital marketing efficiency and website visibility for air forwarding firms.

"‘Health-food’ is a health marketing term used for suggesting consumers, the specifically designed healthy diet for high nutrition and body growth. A health-food mainly includes organic food, natural and non-GMO foods, special foods for allergic people like gluten-free, lactose-free and dairy-free products and low fat-high protein keto diet products such as beans, legumes, nuts and seeds. Food consumption patterns of ‘health-foods’ and their preferences are constantly changing all over the world, due to change in urban-lifestyle patterns leading to high stress, anxiety and health related diseases like diabetes and obesity etc. In today’s era “Eating healthy and living healthy” is a most suitable mantra for living a good life. According to the global health and wellness food market report, it is expected that during 2020-2024, the size of the health and wellness food market is likely to rise by US$ 235.94, advancing at a CAGR of 6 percent. Organic and gluten-free foods are considered to be on top when talking about the health-foods. There is need to further explore the mindset of consumers regarding health-foods and their consumption, since its benefits looks promising but very little is known about the consumers’ beliefs, motivations and values driving their decision in making the purchase of these foods. Various researches indicates that a better understanding of consumers' perception of health foods are the main factors for market positioning, growth and for negotiating market opportunities. Main objective of the paper is to understand the perception of consumer using Big Data analysis so as to assist health food manufacturers to improve food products according to customer choices and preferences. In this study, by using social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, posts, and reviews that have played a major role in increased sales of health foods, we will primarily concentrate on understanding the public perception regarding organic and gluten-free foods. The study will also provide in-depth insights about health-foods in form of positive, negative and neutral sentiments of the consumers using the social media data from Talkwalker and Google Trends. This research would help organic food and glutenfree food manufacturers to understand the consumer perception and to improve marketing return on investment. The results of the study discussed the 'most talked about' and anticipated product innovation in health-food sectors such as new snacks, fast food (pizza, pasta and noodles) and desserts.

"We develop a flexible content-based search model that links the content preferences of search engine users to query search volume and click-through rates, while allowing content preferences to vary systematically based on the context of a search. Content preferences are defined over latent topics that describe the content of search queries and search result descriptions. Compared with existing applications of topic modeling in marketing and recommendation systems, our proposed approach can simultaneously capture multiple types of information and investigate multiple aspects of behavioral dynamics in a single framework that enables interpretable results for business decision making. To facilitate efficient and scalable inference, we develop a full Bayesian variational inference algorithm. We evaluate our modeling framework using real-world search data for TV shows from the Bing search engine. We illustrate how our model can quantify the content preferences associated with each query and how these preferences vary systematically based on whether the query is observed before, during, or after a TV show is aired. We also show that our model can help the search engine improve its ranking of search results as well as address the cold-start problem for new page links.

"Retailers need to manage a series of complex decisions relating to numerous products. To reduce this complexity, they have introduced category management practices, which consider groups of similar products (categories) that can be managed separately as single business units (SBUs). Although the concept that the store offer should be organised as a category mix and that this strategy allows for better overall store management is already consolidated, retailers still struggle to adopt an approach to the store performance measurement starting from a category level perspective. Nowadays, the available methods for measuring categories’ performance are quite limited. The current trend sees the measurement of category performance mainly based on sell-out data that are ill-equipped to fully address category management issues. Retailers should broaden their field of analysis not only by focusing on the product/sales perspective but also by including other methodologies such as shopper behaviour analysis. In this regard, the use of technology offers the retail sector new perspectives for those analysis. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the retail analytics topic by presenting a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring. More in detail, we could derive a new key performance indicator, category conversion power (CCP), aimed at analysing and comparing the single categories organised within the store. The research is based on a unique dataset obtained from a real-time locating system (RTLS), which allowed us to collect behavioural data togheter with sell-out data (from POS scanner). We argue that retailers could exploit this new analytical method to gain more understanding at the category level and therefore make data-driven decisions aimed at improving performance at the store level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Pascucci F.; Nardi L.; Marinelli L.; Paolanti M.; Frontoni E.; Gregori G.L.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102880,Big data; Category management; Performance measurement; Retail marketing; RTLS technology; Shopper behaviour,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring, which aligns with tactical decision-making by interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets and structured analysis.",scopus-big data,20,60,Combining sell-out data with shopper behaviour data for category performance measurement: The role of category conversion power,2022

"Green consumption behavior is the embodiment of pro-environmental behavior, which is of great value to curb carbon emissions. However, the existing research on the model construction and quantitative analysis of the psychological process of green consumption behavior needs to be further explored. Therefore, on the basis of green consumption behavior and metacognitive theory, this study constructs a conceptual model of a psychological process with a psychological control source, green consumption attitude, three aspects of metacognition, and green consumption behavior and puts forward the hypothesis of an action mechanism. This study combines text mining technology and expert knowledge to establish a user review mining dictionary and mines the variables in the quantitative conceptual model through word embedding to test empirically the mechanism hypothesis. The results show that psychological control source has a significant impact on green consumption behavior, and green consumption attitude plays a partial mediating role between them. Metacognitive knowledge plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption behavior; metacognitive experience plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption attitude. Metacognitive monitoring plays a moderating role between green consumption attitude and green consumption behavior. In view of the above research results, we put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions: For organizations, it is necessary to identify green consumption groups, attach importance to green consumption experience, perform well in green marketing, and improve the competitiveness of green products; for decision makers, it is necessary to control strictly the industry standards of the green product market and perform well not only in the quality supervision of green products but also in the post-market construction of green products. © 2023 by the authors.",Chen J.; Liu Q.,Tactical,10.3390/su15108391,green consumption behavior; metacognitive theory; psychological control source; text mining technology,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The study constructs a conceptual model and hypotheses related to green consumption behavior, suggesting specific actions and strategies for organizations and decision-makers, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-big data,20,60,The Green Consumption Behavior Process Mechanism of New Energy Vehicles Driven by Big Data—From a Metacognitive Perspective,2023
"With the advancement of internet technology, customers increasingly rely on online reviews as a valuable source of information. The study aims to develop a marketing data analytics framework to manage online reviews, especially fake reviews, which have become a significant issue undermining the creditability of online review systems. As small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the capabilities to automatically derive customer insights from online reviews, this study proposes a cost-effective, extensible Review-Analytics-as-a-Service (RAaaS) framework that can be operated by non-data specialists to facilitate online review data analytics. We demonstrate the framework’s application by using two datasets with more than 400,000 online reviews from Yelp to simulate live platforms and demonstrate an analytic flow of review fraud detection and understanding. The findings reveal insights into the influence of fake reviews on product ranking and exposure rate. Moreover, it was found that there was a higher concentration of sadness and anger in fake reviews (vs. organic reviews). In addition, fake reviews tend to be shorter, more extreme (with the use of strong adverbs), and have different patterns of topic distribution.

"Data quality has become an area of increasing concern in marketing research. Methods of collecting data, types of data analyzed, and data analytics techniques have changed substantially in recent years. It is important, therefore, to examine the current state of marketing research, and particularly self-administered questionnaires. This paper provides researchers important advice and rules of thumb for crafting high quality research in light of the contemporary changes occuring in modern marketing data collection practices. This is accomplished by a proposed six-step research design process that ensures data quality, and ultimately research integrity, are established and maintained throughout the research process—from the earliest conceptualization and design phases, through data collection, and ultimately the reporting of results. This paper provides a framework, which if followed, will result in reduced headaches for researchers and more robust results for decision makers. © The Author(s) 2021.",Moore Z.; Harrison D.E.; Hair J.,Tactical,10.1177/14707853211052183,big data; data analytics; data quality; marketing research; research design; research methods; sampling; secondary data; self-administered questionnaires; statistical analysis; structural equation modeling; survey design; survey research,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses improving data collection methods and research design processes in marketing, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-big data,10,70,Data Quality Assurance Begins Before Data Collection and Never Ends: What Marketing Researchers Absolutely Need to Remember,2021
"A large amount of information is generated on social platforms linked to tourism activity. It is necessary to explore this information using analysis techniques based on Big Data since the result greatly values decision-making. This paper aims to evaluate the titles of the reviews published on Tripadvisor about 3 and 4-star hotels of a World Heritage City (Cáceres, Extremadura, Spain) to outline the attributes most valued by tourists. Content analysis was performed using the user-generated content (UGC) in Tripadvisor, together with techniques that facilitated the processing of the data to discover the most important characteristics assessed by clients during their stays. The analysis shows a positive evaluation of the hotels in the city of Cáceres, highlighting the hotel stay, location, service, and value for money as the most outstanding elements. Based on the results obtained, a recommendation for hotel managers is to focus their communication strategies on location, quality, and price factors. It is worth noting the importance that the implementation of Big Data techniques of analysis has for the sector, allowing for better knowledge of clients and helping to maintain a competitive position in the market. © 2022 by the authors.",Sánchez-Vargas E.; Campón-Cerro A.M.; Prado-Recio E.; Pasaco-González B.S.; Moreno-Lobato A.,Tactical,10.3390/su142315695,content analysis; hotel sector; NVIVO; tourism marketing; user-generated content (UGC),5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses evaluating customer reviews to identify key attributes valued by tourists, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on specific targets such as improving hotel communication strategies based on customer feedback.",scopus-big data,10,70,Exploring the Hotel Experience in a Cultural City through a UGC Analysis,2022
"At present, the focus of marketing research is mostly on the influencing factors, composition, and measurement of brand equity. The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components. It was a detailed study of the current state of brand marketing strategies and customer satisfaction, found key indicators of brands that could improve customer satisfaction, and presented corresponding suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies.

"Under the pressure of surging advertising costs and fierce market competition, a growing number of online merchants are trying to implement new advertising strategies to improve advertising efficiency and increase sales. In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Hu L.; Sun X.; Yu H.; Chung S.H.,Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2022.3169392,E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract discusses specific advertising strategies (MA and TA) that merchants use to improve advertising efficiency and sales, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable plans.",scopus-big data,10,70,Seize the Opportunity of Targeted Marketing under the Platform Membership Mechanism,2024
"The recent rise of big data analytics is transforming the apparel retailing industry. E-retailers, for example, effectively use large volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business operations data to aid operations and supply chain management. Although logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions, leaving it an under-researched area of study. Adding to this research stream by exploring the case of a U.K.-based fast-fashion retailer, this article reveals unique consumer segments and links them to the revenue they are capable of generating. Applying the partitioning around medoids algorithm to three random samples of 10 000 unique consumer visits to the e-commerce site of a fast-fashion retailer, six consumer segments are identified. This article shows that although the 'mobile window shoppers' segment consists of the largest consumer segment, it attracts the lowest revenue. In contrast, 'visitors with a purpose,' although one of the smallest segments, generates the highest revenue. The findings of this article contribute to marketing research and inform practice, which can use these insights to target customer segments in a more tailored fashion.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Zavali M.; Lacka E.; De Smedt J.,Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2021.3070069,Apparel retailing; big data; clickstream data; consumer segmentation; online purchase,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract focuses on analyzing consumer segments based on clickstream data to inform marketing decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing analytics and customer targeting strategies.",scopus-big data,10,70,Shopping Hard or Hardly Shopping: Revealing Consumer Segments Using Clickstream Data,2023
"Purpose: This study aims to provide more insight into how customer voice is captured and used in managerial decision-making at the marketing-finance interface. This study’s focus is on understanding how the customer voice, often communicated through online and social media platforms, is used in high-performing hotels. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a case study of four high-performing Irish hotels. For each case, multiple informants, including marketing managers, general managers and finance managers, were interviewed and shadowed. Twenty seven decisions across the four cases were analysed to assess the use of customer voice in managerial decision-making. Findings: Social media provides a stage that has empowered the customer voice because of the public nature of the interaction and the network effect. Customer voice is incorporated in managerial decision-making in three distinct ways – symbolically as part of an early warning system, for action-oriented operational decisions and to some extent in the knowledge-enhancing role for tactical decisions. While there is a greater appreciation among senior managers and the finance and accounting managers of the importance of customer voice, this study finds clear limits in its utilisation and more reliance on traditional finance and accounting data, especially in strategic decision-making. Research limitations/implications: The cases belong to a highly visible open environment of hotels in an industry where customer voice has immediate and strong effects. The findings may not directly apply to industries characterised by a relatively more closed context such as banking or insurance. Moreover, the findings reflect the practices of high-performing hotels and do not necessarily capture the practices used in less successfully operating hotels. Practical implications: While marketers need to enhance their ability to create a narrative that links the customer voice to revenue generation, finance managers also need to develop a skillset and adopt a mindset that appropriately reflects the influential role for customer voice in managerial decision-making. Originality/value: Despite the linkage of marketing performance to business performance, there is limited research on the impact of customer information on managerial decision-making. This research provides insight into how customer voice is considered at the critical marketing-finance interface. © 2022, Deepak Saxena, Mairead Brady, Markus Lamest and Martin Fellenz.",Saxena D.; Brady M.; Lamest M.; Fellenz M.,Tactical,10.1108/QMR-09-2020-0113,Big data; Customer voice; Managerial decision-making; Marketing-finance interface; Service decisions; Social media,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses how customer voice is incorporated into managerial decision-making, particularly in operational decisions and tactical aspects like knowledge enhancement.

"Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance. © 2016 University of Minnesota.

"Although the existing literature has acknowledged the importance of mobile marketing, few scholars have examined the efficacy of mobile targeting. This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile targeting by investigating the effects of customer mobile habits and social capital on firm sales. Leveraging unique customer mobile browsing data from a major telecom service provider in China, we use a Bayesian SEM (structural equation modeling) approach to show that customer mobile habits and social capital exert significant influences on customers' purchase intentions. Specifically, customers who engage in more hedonic mobile behaviors, such as social networking, video browsing, and gaming are associated with a higher probability of purchasing, controlling for the usage of communications apps including messaging and emailing apps, and the usage of functional apps, such as maps, living services, and app market apps. Additionally, our research results reveal a significant positive effect of social capital on firms' sales performance.

"Purpose - Big data produced by mobile apps contains valuable knowledge about customers and markets and have been viewed as productive resources. The purpose of this paper is to propose a multiple methods approach to elicit intelligence and value from big data by analysing the customer behaviour in mobile app usage. Design/methodology/approach - The big data analytical approach is developed using three data mining techniques: RFM(recency, frequency, monetary) analysis, link analysis, and association rule learning. The authors then conduct a case study to apply this approach to analyse the transaction data extracted from a mobile app. Findings - This approach can identify high value and mass customers, and understand their patterns and preferences in using the functions of the mobile app. Such knowledge enables the developer to capture the behaviour of large pools of customers and to improve products and services by mixing and matching the functions and offering personalised promotions and marketing information. Originality/value - The approach used in this study balances complexity with usability, thus facilitating corporate use of big data in making product improvement and customisation decisions.

"Enabled by the big data driven user profiling and precision bidding techniques, online programmatic advertising markets have evolved from the traditional website-buying or ad-slot-buying models to a fine-grained and real-time trading model at the level of ad impressions (i.e., ad inventory). As a result, Web publishers are now facing a challenging decision of allocating the ad inventory across multiple advertising models, which has a direct and important influence on both their individual revenues, and the market-wide supply-demand balance. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF), taking into consideration the possible scenarios of ad inventory allocation in programmatic advertising markets. AIAF explicitly captures the specific features of ad inventory allocation in each of three levels (i.e., channel level, market level and platform level), and also their influence-feedback effects. We present the general solution process for solving this model on the basis of its property analysis. An illustrative instantiation of our AIAF model is formulated to demonstrate its applications in supporting publishers’ decision-making on the ad inventory allocation. We also conduct experiments based on empirical data so as to validate the model and analysis. Our research findings indicate that 1) our AIAF model outperforms other single-level and two-level allocation strategies; 2) the fine-grained optimization is superior to that of the coarse-grained level; 3) allocation decisions should be made on the basis of the comparative marginal revenue instead of the absolute marginal revenue. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Li J.; Ni X.; Yuan Y.; Wang F.-Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2018.09.001,Ad inventory; Header bidding; Private marketplace; Programmatic advertising; Real-time bidding,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF) that supports publishers' decision-making regarding ad inventory allocation, which is a tactical decision process that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.

"The application of churn prevention represents an important step for mobile communication companies aiming at increasing customer loyalty. In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk.

"Companies have realized the importance of ""big data"" in creating a sustainable competitive advantage, and user-generated content (UGC) represents one of big data's most important sources. From blogs to social media and online reviews, consumers generate a huge amount of brand-related information that has a decisive potential business value for marketing purposes. Particularly, we focus on online reviews that could have an influence on brand image and positioning. Within this context, and using the usual quantitative star score ratings, a recent stream of research has employed sentiment analysis (SA) tools to examine the textual content of reviews and categorize buyer opinions. Although many SA tools split comments into negative or positive, a review can contain phrases with different polarities because the user can have different sentiments about each feature of the product. Finding the polarity of each feature can be interesting for product managers and brand management. In this paper, we present a general framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, text data mining, and clustering techniques, to obtain new scores based on consumer sentiments for different product features. The main contribution of our proposal is the combination of price and the aforementioned scores to define a new global score for the product, which allows us to obtain a ranking according to product features. Furthermore, the products can be classified according to their positive, neutral, or negative features (visualized on dashboards), helping consumers with their sustainable purchasing behavior. We proved the validity of our approach in a case study using big data extracted from Amazon online reviews (specifically cell phones), obtaining satisfactory and promising results. After the experimentation, we could conclude that our work is able to improve recommender systems by using positive, neutral, and negative customer opinions and by classifying customers based on their comments. © 2019 by the authors.",Kauffmann E.; Peral J.; Gil D.; Ferrández A.; Sellers R.; Mora H.,Tactical,10.3390/su11154235,Big data; Feature selection; Marketing decisions; Sentiment analysis,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses the use of sentiment analysis and natural language processing to improve marketing practices, particularly in analyzing online reviews for better product recommendations and consumer insights.

If the attributes of good customers and those of other customers are clarified, such information is valuable as input for making a new marketing strategy. Regarding the product items, the characteristics of good items that are bought by many users are valuable information. It is necessary to construct a method to efficiently analyze such characteristics. This paper proposes a new latent class model to analyze both purchasing and browsing histories to make latent item and user clusters. By applying the proposal, an example of data analysis on an EC site is demonstrated. Through the clusters obtained by the proposed latent class model and the classification rule by the decision tree model, new findings are extracted from the data of purchasing and browsing histories. © 2015 KIIE.",Goto M.; Mikawa K.; Hirasawa S.; Kobayashi M.; Suko T.; Horii S.,Tactical,10.7232/iems.2015.14.4.335,Aspect model; Big data; Business analytics; Customer segmentation; Latent class model; Web marketing,5.0,,10,0,Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers,"The abstract discusses the analysis of purchasing and browsing histories to identify good customers and product characteristics, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at improving targeted strategies and marketing effectiveness.",scopus-big data,15,70,A new latent class model for analysis of purchasing and browsing histories on EC sites,2015
"This paper proposes a hybrid method for online reviews analysis through multi-criteria decision-making, text mining and predictive learning techniques to find the relative importance of factors affecting travelers' decision-making in selecting green hotels with spa services. The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.",Nilashi M.; Mardani A.; Liao H.; Ahmadi H.; Manaf A.A.; Almukadi W.,Tactical,10.3390/su11216013,Big data; Green hotels; Machine learning techniques; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neuro-fuzzy; Satisfaction; Sustainable development; TOPSIS,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract details a hybrid method for analyzing online reviews to support decision-making in selecting hotels, which aligns with tactical goals of interpreting strategic plans into actionable insights.

"Industry advocates argue that by tailoring services and commercial solicitations to match media users’ personal interests, data-driven marketing benefits both consumers and businesses. This article shows, however, that advertisers and marketers who are taking up ideas and techniques from behavioral economics tell their clients a very different story about the aims and use of digital marketing and consumer surveillance. Listening in on this discourse demonstrates that some digital marketers conceptualize their own practices as forms of social control, appropriating concepts from behavioral economics to identify consumers’ cognitive and affective biases and target their vulnerabilities. Behavioral economics recognizes that economic decisions are not simply dictated by rational self-interest; rather, such choices depend on cognitive heuristics and habits, and can be manipulated through the design of “choice architecture.” This article discusses implications of the behavioral turn in data-driven marketing for critical advertising scholars, public advocates, and regulators. © 2017 National Communication Association.",Nadler A.; McGuigan L.,Tactical,10.1080/15295036.2017.1387279,Behavioral economics; big data; consumer surveillance; digital marketing; political economy,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the implications of behavioral economics in digital marketing practices and how marketers use these insights to target consumer vulnerabilities.

"Big data generated by social media stands for a valuable source of information, which offers an excellent opportunity to mine valuable insights. Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is able to increase the classification accuracy of several existing works based on RNN models for sentiment analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Ait Hammou B.; Ait Lahcen A.; Mouline S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102122,Big data; BiLSTM; FastText; GRU; LSTM; Natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Social big data analytics,5.0,,20,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the development of a sentiment analysis approach that enhances classification accuracy and supports decision-making processes in marketing activities, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-big data,15,60,Towards a real-time processing framework based on improved distributed recurrent neural network variants with fastText for social big data analytics,2020
"In the age of big data, companies store practically all data on any client transaction. Making use of this data is commonly done with machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost.

"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",Du R.Y.; Hu Y.; Damangir S.,Tactical,10.1509/jm.12.0459,Big data; Conjoint analysis; Google trends; Market response model; Product feature,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses using online search trends to influence marketing decisions, which implies a more structured, decision-making approach aligned with marketing analytics and campaign optimization, aligning with tactical goals.",scopus-big data,15,65,Leveraging trends in online searches for product features in market response modeling,2015

"The article analyzes economic behavior throughout the world in response to the media effort of tourist destinations in dispersed markets. The Internet has influenced communication and boosted new technologies, which have advanced dramatically in the first three decades of the twenty-first century. This has had an impact on the various economic activities, among which tourism is particularly salient. Consequently, consumers no longer have a receptive role. They have become decision makers with respect to the media material that they consume in addition to having the opportunity of being information providers. Mexico City (CDMX), as a tourism segment, is no exception. It depends on the communication of public and private actors, who, while having certain methodologies and tools to access their audiences, interact with an audience that decides on what it receives and gives its opinion on the web. Therefore, the objective of the research is to assess the associated concepts, pages and organizations related to tourism in CDMX on the website aimed at both a domestic and international audience, designed by the government and private sector together with the input of the audience as an information provider. Likewise, the study seeks to determine the countries with the greatest interest in Mexico City as a tourist destination, since this can be highly important for directing the marketing strategies. The methodology used to explore the phenomenon takes a documentary and quantitative form, since in a first stage it includes the documentary analysis and subsequently makes the mathematical exploration through the use of network analysis (ARS) to assess the role of Big data and Smart Data in the CDMX brand before the fragmentation of audiences. © 2020 Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Turisticas.

"Despite new privacy rules and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data and Protection Regulation and the pending California Consumer Protection Act, not all consumers feel the need for data protection. Recent research has shown that 20-25 per cent of the US adult population are willing to share their personal data with marketers they ‘trust’. The marketing challenge thus becomes how to identify these willing ‘data sharers’. Using a widely available data set, this study illustrates several ‘Big Data-based’ segmentation methodologies to screen this important segment out of the general population, ranging from factor analysis to chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) decision trees. The results of these analyses identify some unexpected potential segments among these ‘data sharer’ groups, most notably young men who participate in team sports. Thus, the paper argues that rather than looking at privacy regulation as a burden, marketers might well consider it a key element in their toolbox. © 2020, Henry Stewart Publications.

"In the big data era, firms are inundated with customer data, which are valuable in improving services, developing new products, and identifying new markets. However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages.

"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the temporal dynamics of users browsing activity on a hotel website in order to derive effective marketing strategies and constantly improve website effectiveness. Users' activities on the hotel's website on yearly, monthly, daily and hourly basis are examined and compared, demonstrating the power of informatics and data analytics. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 29,976 hourly Weblog files from 1 August 2014 to 31 December 2017 were collected from a luxury hotel in Hong Kong. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons were used to analyse the data. Findings: Users' browsing behaviours, particularly stickiness, on the hotel website differ on yearly, monthly, daily and weekly bases. Users' activities increased steadily from 2014 to 2016, but dropped in 2017. Users are most active from July to September, on weekdays, and from noon to evening time. The month-, day-, and hour-based behaviours changed through years. The analysis of big data determines strategic and operational management and marketing decision-making. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the usage patterns of their websites allow organisations to make a range of strategic, marketing, pricing and distribution decisions to optimise their performance. Fluctuation of website usage and level of customer engagement have implications on customer support and services, as well as strategic partnership decisions.

"Real Time Bidding (RTB) is a novel business model of online computational advertising, developing rapidly with the integration of Internet economy and big data analysis. It evolves the business logic of online ad-delivery from buying “ad-impressions” in websites or ad slots to directly buying the best-matched “target audiences”, and thus can help advertisers achieve the precision marketing. As a critical part of RTB advertising markets, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) play a central role in matching advertisers with their target audiences via cookie-based data analysis and market segmentation, and their segmentation strategies (especially the choice of granularity) have key influences in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RTB advertising markets. Based on a mathematical programming approach, this paper studied DSPs’ strategies for market segmentation, and established a selection model of the granularity for segmenting RTB advertising markets. With the computational experiment approach, we designed three experimental scenarios to validate our proposed model, and the experimental results show that: 1) market segmentation has the potential of improving the total revenue of all the advertisers; 2) with the increasing refinement of the market segmentation granularity, the total revenue has a tendency of a rise first and followed by a decline; 3) the optimal granularity of market segmentation will be significantly influenced by the number of advertisers on the DSP, but less influenced by the number of ad requests. Our findings show the crucial role of market segmentation on the RTB advertising effect, and indicate that the DSPs should adjust their market segmentation strategies according to their total number of advertisers. Our findings also highlight the importance of advertisers as well as the characteristics of the target audiences to DSPs’ market segmentation decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Qin R.; Yuan Y.; Wang F.-Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2017.07.001,Computational experiment; Demand Side Platforms; Market segmentation; Real Time Bidding,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the strategies of Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) in market segmentation, focusing on how these strategies can influence the effectiveness and efficiency of Real Time Bidding (RTB) advertising.

"Unstructured data in social media is as part of the ""big data"" spectrum. Unstructured data in Social media can provide useful insights into social phenomena and citizen opinions, both of which are critical to government policy and businesses decisions. Teachers of business intelligence and analytics commonly use quantitative data from sales, marketing, finance and manufacturing to demonstrate various analytics concepts in a business context. However, researchers have seldom used social media data to analyze social behavior and communication. In this study we aim to demonstrate an assessment structure for teaching social media analytics concepts with the goal of analyzing and interpreting social media content. We base this assessment on forum postings regarding two recent events: the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The aim of the assessment is to discover social insights. We base the assessment structure on Cooper's Analytics Framework to cover such concepts as term frequency (TF), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), data visualization, sentiments and opinions analysis, the Nearest Neighbor K-NN classification algorithm, and Information Diffusion theory.

Success does not depend only in the number of likes, comments or followers. It also depends in how much positive discussions have been held among the users of social media. The objective of this paper is to build a model that performs multi-class classification of Big data with improved accuracy. The proposed model uses a hybrid of Lexicon-based approach and Machine Learning based approach. In this paper, we have performed the sentiment analysis on the three Central Government Schemes namely Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Make-in India. The Apache Spark’s Machine Learning library, MLlib has been used in order to achieve better results in sentiment analysis for the Big Data. The AFINN dictionary was used to label the tweets and bigrams feature set was used. The Hashing TF-IDF method was used to extract the feature vectors from the raw feature set. These vectors were classified by Random Forest classifier to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments of tweets. The result from this model was tested by using the various testing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-score. The higher accuracy of 89.27% was obtained. © 2020, Research Trend.

"We introduce a method for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing submarkets in product categories. We give an overview of the market structure and competitive submarket literature and then describe a classic model for testing competitive submarkets along with associated extensions. In the era of big data and with the increasing availability of large-scale consumer purchase data, there is a need for techniques that can interpret these data and use them to help make managerial decisions. We introduce a statistical likelihood based technique for both identifying and testing market structure. We run a series of experiments on generated data and show that our method is better at identifying market structure from brand substitution data than a range of methods described in the marketing literature. We introduce tools for holdout validation, complexity control, and testing managerial hypotheses. We describe a method for visualization of submarket solutions, and we give several traditional consumer product examples and in addition give an example to show how market structure can be analyzed from online review data. © 2016 INFORMS.",France S.L.; Ghose S.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2015.0958,Big data; Brand switching; Cluster analysis; Likelihood estimation; Market segmentation; Market structure; Submarket analysis; Visualization,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses methods for identifying and analyzing submarkets within product categories, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"People increasingly choose to express themselves online through electronic word of mouth (eWOM), generating large amounts of data, making eWOM a valuable source of information through big data analytics. This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers’ opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers’ preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers’ opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product. This work constitutes a methodological contribution with demonstrated implications for new product positioning strategy evaluation using tweet analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Gregoriades A.; Pampaka M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2020.100986,Micro-blogs; Product positioning; Sentiment Analysis; Topic modelling,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a methodology for evaluating an organization's product-positioning strategy using eWOM analytics, which involves structured decision-making based on consumer opinions and preferences over time.

"In a world where digital interactions have become the norm, chatbots are evolving to not only assist with tasks but also to alleviate feelings of social exclusion. This study investigates how anthropomorphic chatbots influence customer engagement and emotional responses following social exclusion, and further impact their commercial decisions. Through a between-subject experiment involving 609 participants, we explored the effects of anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) chatbots across three social exclusion conditions (ignored, rejected, and control). Our findings reveal that anthropomorphic chatbots significantly enhance purchase intention, relational investment, and organizational trust, mediated by increased senses of belonging and control and enhanced parasocial interactions. This research enriches the marketing literature by applying the need-threat model and illuminating the psychological mechanisms underlying customer responses. The practical implications for marketing and public relations professionals include strategies for optimizing brand-consumer interactions through the strategic use of anthropomorphic chatbots. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Jia X.; Zhao X.; Tao W.; Ahn S.,Tactical,10.1080/15332861.2024.2375965,anthropomorphism; Chatbot; commercial decisions; need-threat model; social exclusion,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on how anthropomorphic chatbots enhance customer engagement and emotional responses, which involves interpreting strategic goals into specific marketing tactics to optimize brand-consumer interactions.",scopus-chatbot,20,60,From Exclusion to Connection: The Role of Anthropomorphic Chatbots in Shaping Customer Responses Post-Social Exclusion,2024
"Chatbots engage in real-time conversations with customers. Moreover, they can collect data in a digital landscape that is increasingly sensitive to privacy. The objective of this study was to help strategic marketing decision-makers better understand how and where chatbots can be used effectively to gather consumer data. We analyse whether consumers’ privacy concerns influence their adoption. Furthermore, we invest if privacy concerns, and subsequently information disclosure, are significantly influenced by the chatbot’s location. In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer’s website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots. Both relationships are sequentially mediated via higher privacy concerns and less comfort with information disclosure. Companies therefore need to consider where to deploy their chatbots.

"This study explored digital privacy concerns in the use of chatbots as a digital banking service. Three dimensions of trust were tested in relation to user self-disclosure in order to better understand the consumer-chatbot experience in banking. The methodology selected for this research study followed a conclusive, pre-experimental, two-group one-shot case study research design which made use of a non-probability snowballing sampling technique. Privacy concerns were found to have a significantly negative relationship with user self-disclosure in both treatment groups. Respondents exposed to their preferred banking brand experienced lower user self-disclosure and brand trust than those exposed to a fictitious banking brand within the South African context. It is recommended that companies using chatbots focus on easing privacy concerns and build foundations of trust. The gains that chatbots have made in the form of increased productivity and quality of customer service rely on relationships with users who need to disclose personal information. Through this study, we concluded that, despite its power to influence decision-making, the power of a brand is not enough for consumers to considerably increase self-disclosure. Rather, a bridge of trust (through education, communication and product development) is needed that encompasses all three elements of trust, which are brand trust, cognitive trust and emotional trust. Limited research exists on the relationship between financial services marketing and chatbot adoption. Thus, this study addressed a theoretical gap, by adding brand trust to existing studies on cognitive and emotional trust regarding user self-disclosure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Lappeman J.; Marlie S.; Johnson T.; Poggenpoel S.,Tactical,10.1057/s41264-022-00154-z,Chatbots; Conversational commerce; Digital privacy; Internet banking; Online brand trust; User self-disclosure,5.0,,15,0,Palgrave Macmillan,"The study focuses on the relationship between digital privacy concerns and user self-disclosure in the context of chatbot usage in banking, which can inform targeted strategies and approaches for improving user engagement and trust.

"We investigate the impacts of chatbots' technical features on employees' perceptions (namely, chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots) in the context of B2B marketing. In particular, to capture the technical features of chatbots, we identify three types of chatbot affordances (i.e., automatability, personalization, and availability) and three types of chatbot disaffordances (i.e., limited understanding, lack of emotion, and null decision-making). We show that these types of chatbot affordances and disaffordances are related to chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots, which in turn can affect employees' attitudes toward chatbots. We conducted an empirical study via an online survey and collected data from 228 B2B marketing employees. While automatability and personalization enhance chatbot effectiveness, null decision-making increases discomfort with using chatbots. Further, chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots both influence employees' attitudes toward chatbots.

"With the increase of per capita disposable income of residents and the improvement of social and economic development, people's demand for entertainment has surged, and the online live broadcasting industry has ushered in a golden age of vigorous development. Traditional webcast has the shortcomings of poor user experience, low interactivity and low content quality, which makes it difficult to meet the diversified and personalized consumption requirements of the audience. In this context, the live broadcast system based on social media platform has become one of the effective means to solve these problems. The new media online live emotional marketing has a strong transmissibility, which can provide consumers with more rich and interesting ways to obtain information, and can also improve the effect of brand promotion and word of mouth promotion. Based on the theory of multimodal learning, this paper analyzed the characteristics of user behavior among different types of social networking sites, and explored the emotional interaction mode on social networking sites from the visual and voice dimensions, and provided a basis for the formulation of emotional marketing strategies for webcasting and business decision-making. The article also compared the traditional live broadcast marketing mode with the online live broadcast emotional marketing under the new media environment. The results showed that the live broadcast marketing under the new media environment has a better effect, and the sales volume has also increased by 3.87%. It can effectively control costs and audience satisfaction is also higher.

"Owning life insurance coverage that is not enough to pay for the expenses is called underinsurance, and it has been found to have a significant influence on the sustainability and financial health of families. However, insurance companies need to have a good profile of potential policyholders. Customer profiling has become one of the essential marketing strategies for any sustainable business, such as the insurance market, to identify potential life insurance purchasers. One well-known method of carrying out customer profiling and segmenting is machine learning. Hence, this study aims to provide a helpful framework for predicting potential life insurance policyholders using a data mining approach with different sampling methods and to lead to a transition to sustainable life insurance industry development. Various samplings, such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, Randomly Under-Sampling, and ensemble (bagging and boosting) techniques, are proposed to handle the imbalanced dataset. The result reveals that the decision tree is the best performer according to ROC and, according to balanced accuracy, F1 score, and GM comparison, Naïve Bayes seems to be the best performer. It is also found that ensemble models do not guarantee high performance in this imbalanced dataset.

"In today’s fast moving world of marketing from product-orientation to customer-orientation, the management of customer treatment can be seen as a key to achieve revenue growth and profitability. Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance. Most customer segmentation approaches based on customer value fail to account for the factor of time and the trend of value changes in their analysis. In this article, we classify customers based on their value using the RFM model and K-means clustering method. Then, an assessment of changes over several periods of time is carried out. The originality of this research lies in its incorporation of time and trend of customer value changes in improving the accuracy of predictions based on the past behavior of customers.

"The quantity of electronic bank data grows exponentially with development of Information Technology (IT). The size of these data is impossible for traditional database and human analyst to come up with interesting information that will help in process of decision making. Management Information System (MIS) based Data warehouse (DW) and Data Mining (DM) techniques support the development of IT and process of management decision-making. But the traditional DW size make the query complex, which may cause unacceptable delay in decision support queries. Thus, in this paper an Efficient Electronic Bank MIS based DW and Mining Processing (EEBMIS-DWMP) was developed with cluster and non-cluster indexed view to provide decision-makers with both best response time and precise information. Also, analysis of the multilayer perception neural network, naïve Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and C5.0 on a real-world data of bank was done to improve effectiveness for campaign by analyzing the most useful features that influence campaign success. Results offer how the proposed EEBMIS-DWMP developed bank organizations by comparing performance of system with and without index view in terms of balance accuracy, accuracy, precision, recall, mean absolute error, root mean square error, F measure and running time. Conclusions from results offers that EEBMIS-DWMP can construct a database for each customer, a storage system that integrates data from a variety of sources into a single unified framework, decrease errors and time required to prepare financial reports, quickly access for information, analysis of data in multivariate, accurate prediction of competent, profitability segmentation. © 2022",Luo J.; Xu J.; Aldosari O.; Althubiti S.A.; Deebani W.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103086,Data mining; Data warehouse; Index view; Management information system; Marketing,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,The abstract discusses the development of an Efficient Electronic Bank Management Information System (EEBMIS-DWMP) which focuses on improving decision-making related to campaign effectiveness through data mining techniques.

"This study proposes a new prescriptive analytics method that aims to provide decision-makers with a systematic and objective approach to identify suitable locations, considering the spatial distribution of different types of restaurants. The method comprises of two main components: spatial co-location pattern mining and locationGCN, where locationGCN is based on graph convolutional network (GCN). The spatial co-location pattern mining is utilized to capture the spatial correlation of specific restaurant to determine the candidate location selection range. The locationGCN is designed to further screen out final suitable location ranges for the specific restaurant type. A case study using restaurant data from Xiamen Island collected from Dianping.com is conducted. The empirical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 74.88%, precision of 63.59%, and recall of 77.48%.

"Hotel managers continue to find ways to understand traveler preferences, with the aim of improving their strategic planning, marketing, and product development. Traveler preference is unpredictable for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers.

"Purpose: In the pharmaceutical industry, marketing and sales managers often deal with massive amounts of marketing and sales data. One of their biggest concerns is to recognize the impact of actions taken on sold-out products. Data mining discovers and extracts useful patterns from such large data sets to find hidden and worthy patterns for the decision-making. This paper, too, aims to demonstrate the ability of data-mining process in improving the decision-making quality in the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach: This research is descriptive in terms of the method applied, as well as the investigation of the existing situation and the use of real data and their description. In fact, the study is quantitative and descriptive, from the point of view of its data type and method. This research is also applicable in terms of purpose. The target population of this research is the data of a pharmaceutical company in Iran. Here, the cross-industry standard process for data mining methodology was used for data mining and data modeling. Findings: With the help of different data-mining techniques, the authors could examine the effect of the visit of doctors overlooking the pharmacies and the target was set for medical representatives on the pharmaceutical sales. For that matter, the authors used two types of classification rules: decision tree and neural network. After the modeling of algorithms, it was determined that the two aforementioned rules can perform the classification with high precision. The results of the tree ID3 were analyzed to identify the variables and path of this relationship. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to provide the real-world direct empirical evidence of “Analytics of Physicians Prescription and Pharmacies Sales Correlation Using Data Mining.” The results showed that the most influential variables of “the relationship between doctors and their visits to pharmacies,” “the length of customer relationship” and “the relationship between the sale of pharmacies and the target set for medical representatives” were “deviation from the implementation plan.” Therefore, marketing and sales managers must pay special attention to these factors while planning and targeting for representatives.

"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on different approaches to variable pre-selection for building net score models (also known as uplift modelling or incremental response modelling). The application of these models supports the identification of customers whose response can be traced back to be an effect of the campaign under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: First, a net scoring methodology based on decision trees is presented. Then, derived from research contributions on this subject and analytics performed on real data from the financial sector, different approaches of variable pre-selection are discussed and compared numerically. Findings: Net-χ2 and net information value as well as the rank lift impact correlation for interval variables would be preferred when performing variable pre-selection for net score models. Simulations showed that the results were relatively stable with respect to the number of cross-validation samples. Practical implications: Variable pre-selection is required since it reduces computational effort that comes along with the complexity of net score models and the availability of a large amount of potential predictors. Some pre-selection methods result in a set of predictors quite close to the application of net scores itself.

"The amount of data belonging to different domains are being stored rapidly in various repositories across the globe. Extracting useful information from the huge volumes of data is always difficult due to the dynamic nature of data being stored. Data Mining is a knowledge discovery process used to extract the hidden information from the data stored in various repositories, termed as warehouses in the form of patterns. One of the popular tasks of data mining is Classification, which deals with the process of distinguishing every instance of a data set into one of the predefined class labels. Banking system is one of the real-world domains, which collects huge number of client data on a daily basis. In this work, we have collected two variants of the bank marketing data set pertaining to a Portuguese financial institution consisting of 41188 and 45211 instances and performed classification on them using two data reduction techniques. Attribute subset selection has been performed on the first data set and the training data with the selected features are used in classification. Principal Component Analysis has been performed on the second data set and the training data with the extracted features are used in classification. A deep neural network classification algorithm based on Backpropagation has been developed to perform classification on both the data sets. Finally, comparisons are made on the performance of each deep neural network classifier with the four standard classifiers, namely Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, Support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors.

"Purpose: National tourism offices worldwide implement marketing strategies to influence tourists’ choices. However, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to choosing a city as a tourism destination. The purpose of this paper is to answer which are the characteristics that play a key role in room occupancy. Design/methodology/approach: Diverse characteristics such as the city offer, demographics, natural amenities (e.g. number of beaches) and also politics (e.g. type of government) are combined into a decision tree model to unveil the relevance of each in determining room occupancy. The empirical experiments used data known in 2015 from 43 cities from Europe and the rest of the World to model room occupancy rate in 2016. Findings: While the seasonality effect plays the most significant role, other less studied features such as the type of political party prior to current government were found to have an impact in room occupancy.

"Although lead scoring is an essential component of lead management, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review and a classification framework dedicated to it. Lead scoring is an effective and efficient way of measuring the quality of leads. In addition, as a critical Information Technology tool, a proper lead scoring model acts as an alleviator to weaken the conflicts between sales and marketing functions. Yet, little is known regarding lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. Lead scoring models are commonly categorized into two classes: traditional and predictive. While the former primarily relies on the experience and knowledge of salespeople and marketers, the latter utilizes data mining models and machine learning algorithms to support the scoring process. This study aims to review and analyze the existing literature on lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine lead scoring models. A total of 44 studies have met the criteria and were included for analysis. Fourteen metrics were identified to measure the impact of lead scoring models on sales performance. With the increased use of data mining and machine learning techniques in the fourth industrial revolution, predictive lead scoring models are expected to replace traditional lead scoring models as they positively impact sales performance. Despite the relative cost of implementing and maintaining predictive lead scoring models, it is still beneficial to supersede traditional lead scoring models, given the higher effectiveness and efficiency of predictive lead scoring models. This study reveals that classification is the most popular data mining model, while decision tree and logistic regression are the most applied algorithms among all the predictive lead scoring models. This study contributes by systematizing and recommending which machine learning method (i.e., supervised and/or unsupervised) shall be used to build predictive lead scoring models based on the integrity of different types of data sources. Additionally, this study offers both theoretical and practical research directions in the lead scoring field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Wu M.; Andreev P.; Benyoucef M.,Tactical,10.1007/s10799-023-00388-w,Data mining model; Lead scoring model; Machine learning algorithm; Sales performance; Systematic literature review,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the implementation and evaluation of lead scoring models, which is a structured process aimed at improving sales performance.

"Priming is challenging when consumers start shortlisting products before the final purchase. This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques.

"Online ads play create opportunities for advisers to discover potential customers by delivering marketing messages through the Internet. Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profit. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible. The prediction results of M-GFDT and the method itself are useful for helping advertisers to optimize their ad strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Wang H.; Hong M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2019.100852,Decision tree; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filter; Online ads,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a method for evaluating and optimizing online ads, which involves structured decisions regarding the removal of ineffective ads and targeting effective ones.

"This study applies a text mining approach to a significant dataset of tweets by academic libraries. The dataset for this research was collected from the complete Twitter timelines of ten academic libraries. The total dataset comprised 23,707 tweets with 17,848 mentions, 7625 hashtags, and 5974 retweets. Academic libraries from the dataset have typically posted fewer than 50 tweets per month, though tweet volume grew rapidly in late-2013 through 2014. The results show variance between academic libraries in distribution of tweets over time. The most frequent word was ""open,"" which was used in a variety of contexts by the academic libraries. It was noted that the most frequent bi-gram (two-word sequence) in the aggregated tweets was ""special collections"". The most frequent tri-gram (three-word sequence) was ""save the date"". The most frequent word categories in the semantic analysis for most libraries were related to ""knowledge, insight, and information concerning personal and cultural relations"". The most common category of the tweets was ""Resources"" among all the selected academic libraries.

"Powered by machine learning technology, online advertising achieves accurate advertisement delivery to potential customers according to online user profiles. However, it raises serious privacy concerns since the learning process may reveal sensitive information in the profiles. It is highly desirable to provide high-quality advertisement recommendations while respecting an individual's privacy. To address the privacy issues, we propose a practical privacy-preserving system that predicts advertisement Click Through Rate (CTR) accurately without revealing any sensitive information of individuals. Our system combines both offline and online training to achieve the goal. In the offline training phase, we develop two differentially private algorithms built upon Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) algorithms, respectively, to transform features and train a privacy-preserving offline model. In the online training phase, we propose a privacy-preserving online learning algorithm to compensate for the decline of offline performance when online feature changes occur. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our system based on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can protect user privacy without compromising the accuracy of CTR prediction, with reasonable computation overhead. © 2021",Sun J.; Zhao L.; Liu Z.; Li Q.; Deng X.; Wang Q.; Jiang Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.cose.2021.102504,Data perturbation; Differential privacy; Learning and optimization; Online advertising; Recommendation system,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses a privacy-preserving system for predicting advertisement Click Through Rate (CTR), which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that focus on advanced targeting and personalization in advertising.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Practical differentially private online advertising,2022
"We propose an online impression-management conceptual model and present a two-step approach to unfold the importance of multiple attributes on a restaurant marketplace mobile app. First, our study uses OpenTable platform data to provide insights into the visual attractiveness of restaurant images. In total, 92,934 images were scraped and further labeled through the Tencent Multi-Label API, which identified six categories of image cues. Second, an exploratory Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) analysis was performed to assess the importance of attributes at different levels from 746 valid survey responses. Furthermore, we performed Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to categorize the consumers by their choice features in which we identified two groups: “visual-image-cues responsive” and “price-rating-cue responsive.” These categories advance the proposed online impression-management conceptual model and indicate that visual information is the most important attribute in decision making.

"There is more than one mobile-phone subscription per member of the Australian population. The number of complaints against the mobile-phone-service providers is also high. Therefore, the mobile service providers are facing a huge challenge in retaining their customers. There are a number of existing models to analyse customer behaviour and switching patterns. A number of switching models may also exist within a large market. These models are often not useful due to the heterogeneous nature of the market. Therefore, in this study we use data mining techniques to let the data talk to help us discover switching patterns without requiring us to use any models and domain knowledge. We use a variety of decision tree and decision forest techniques on a real mobile-phone-usage dataset in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of data mining techniques in knowledge discovery.

"The liberalisation of the European energy market has driven changes in the way firms approach marketing, both for the acquisition of new consumers and for retaining existing ones. To retain consumers, practitioners aim to predict which consumers intend to churn (ie leave), and to understand the reasons behind this intention. To address this need, this study uses data-mining techniques to develop a churn prediction model. The study aims to identify the information that is predictive of churn and, consequently, to shed light on the psychological reasons behind churn. The authors built eight predictive models using decision trees, random forest and logistic regression on a dataset composed of 81,813 consumers of an energy provider, each with one residential electricity contract. The logistic regression was found to outperform the other methods. The discussion focuses on the relevant predictors of churn by addressing a posteriori psychological explanations of consumers’ churn behaviour. The study provides new insights on the reasons why customers churn and, by addressing theoretical psychological explanations, provides a data-mining model with robustness to contextual changes. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Vezzoli M.; Zogmaister C.; Van den Poel D.,Tactical,,Churn prediction model; Consumer psychology; Customer churn; Energy market; Machine learning,5.0,,15,0,Henry Stewart Publications,"The study focuses on developing a churn prediction model, which is a structured approach to understand consumer behavior and retain customers, aligning more closely with tactical decision-making.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Will they stay or will they go?

"The application of business intelligence (BI) techniques for knowledge discovery and decision support empowers organizations in different functions. This article examines the impacts of BI on customer relationship management (CRM) functions (marketing, sales and customer services) in the telecommunications sector. The literature found that BI application in CRM in a telecommunications context is limited but necessary due to the high rate of competition between service providers and the massive data generated by subscribers. This study surveyed employees' perspectives from telecommunications companies in Oman, and results demonstrated mixed impacts. First, the results showed that implementing BI in marketing has a positive impact on business processes values, customer values, but a negative impact on employees' values. Second, implementing BI in sales has a positive impact on financial values and employees' values, but a negative impact on business processes values, and customers' values. Finally, implementing BI in customer service has a positive impact on employees' values.

"Learning the latent patterns of historical data in an efficient way to model the behaviour of a system is a major need for making right decisions. For this purpose, machine learning solution has already begun its promising marks in transportation as well as in many areas such as marketing, finance, education, and health. However, many classification algorithms in the literature assume that the target attribute values in the datasets are unordered, so they lose inherent order between the class values. To overcome the problem, this study proposes a novel ensemble-based ordinal classification (EBOC) approach which suggests bagging and boosting (AdaBoost algorithm) methods as a solution for ordinal classification problem in transportation sector. This article also compares the proposed EBOC approach with ordinal class classifier and traditional tree-based classification algorithms (i.e., C4.5 decision tree, RandomTree, and REPTree) in terms of accuracy.

"The complexity of business decision-making has increased over the years. It is essential for managers to gain a confident understanding of their business environments in order to make successful decisions. With the growth of opinion-rich web resources such as social media, discussion forums, review sites, news corpora, and blogs available on the internet, product and service reviews have become an essential source of information. In a data-driven world, they will improve services and operational insights to achieve real business benefits and help enterprises remain competitive. Despite the prevalence of textual data, few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of real-time text mining and reporting tools in firms and organizations. To address this aspect of decision-making, we have developed and evaluated an unsupervised learning system to automatically extract and classify topics and their emotion score in text streams. Data were collected from commercial websites, open-access databases, and social networks to train the model. In the experiment, the polarity score was quantified at four different levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and the entire text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using subjective data mining, we demonstrate how to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of information from the Web and help traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to capture more information. An opinion tracking system presented by our model extracts subjective information, classifies them, and tracks opinions by utilizing location, time, and reviewers’ positions. Using the online-offline data collection technique, we can update the library topic in real-time to provide users with a market opinion tracker. For marketing or economic research, this approach may be useful. In the experiment, the new model is applied to a case study to demonstrate how the business process improves. © 2022, The Author(s).",Sigari S.; Gandomi A.H.,Tactical,10.1057/s41599-022-01325-y,,5.0,,20,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses the development of an unsupervised learning system for topic extraction and opinion tracking, which aligns with structured decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable insights.

"This research work focuses on integrating the multi attribute decision making with data mining in a fuzzy decision environment for customer relationship management. The main objective is to analyse the relation between multi attribute decision making and data mining considering a complex problem of ordering customers segments, which is based on four criteria of customer’s life time value, viz. length (L), recency (R), frequency (F) and monetary value (M). The proposed integrated approach involves fuzzy C-means (FCM) cluster analysis as data mining tool. The experiment conducted using MATLAB 12.0 for identifying eight clusters of customers. The two multi attribute decision making tools i.e., fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) are used for ranking these identified clusters. The applicability of the integrated decision making technique is also demonstrated in this paper considering the case of Indian retail sector. This research collected responses from nine experts from Indian retail industry regarding their perception of relative importance of four criteria of customer life value and evaluated weights of each criterion using fuzzy AHP. Transaction data of 18 months of the case retail store was analysed to segment 1,600 customers into eight clusters using fuzzy c-means clustering analysis technique. Finally, these eight clusters were ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution).

"Purpose: This paper aims to address the effective selection of customers for direct marketing campaigns. It introduces a new method to forecast campaign-related uplifts (also known as incremental response modeling or net scoring). By means of these uplifts, only the most responsive customers are targeted by a campaign. This paper also aims at calculating the financial impact of the new approach compared to the classical (gross) scoring methods. Design/methodology/approach: First, gross and net scoring approaches to customer selection for direct marketing campaigns are compared. After that, it is shown how net scoring can be applied in practice with regard to different strategical objectives. Then, a new statistic for net scoring based on decision trees is developed. Finally, a business case based on real data from the financial sector is calculated to compare gross and net scoring approaches. Findings: Whereas gross scoring focuses on customers with a high probability of purchase, regardless of being targeted by a campaign, net scoring identifies those customers who are most responsive to campaigns. A common scoring procedure – decision trees – can be enhanced by the new statistic to forecast those campaign-related uplifts. The business case shows that the selected scoring method has a relevant impact on economical indicators. Practical implications: The contribution of net scoring to campaign effectiveness and efficiency is shown by the business case. Furthermore, this paper suggests a framework for customer selection, given strategical objectives, e.g. minimizing costs or maximizing (gross or lift)-added value, and presents a new statistic that can be applied to common scoring procedures. Originality/value: Despite its lever on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, only few contributions address net scores up to now.

"While browsing through an online video platform, potential viewers decide which videos to click and watch based on the information and impression they obtain from thumbnails. Therefore, a thumbnail needs to be able to tell potential viewers what the video is about (i.e., be informative), and at the same time, a thumbnail needs to grab potential viewers' attention (i.e., be visually appealing). Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we take the visual attributes that are relevant to the informativeness of thumbnails (e.g., element complexity and object complexity) as central route cues, take the visual attributes that are relevant to the aesthetics of thumbnails (e.g., celebrity endorsement, colorfulness, brightness, and image quality) as peripheral route cues, and explore the relation between these visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos using 3,745 marketing videos posted by 38 top brands across 4 industries – the automobile, beverage, restaurant, and toy industries – on YouTube. We construct our variables by extracting features from thumbnails using image mining techniques. Our study contributes to the literature on information systems and marketing by enhancing our understanding of the role of the visual attributes of images in persuading viewers in the online environment. Furthermore, our study provides a possible theoretical basis for studies on information processing and decision support that focus on automatic thumbnail selection.

"As the Internet has found its place within different sectors of society, the use of various social networks is increasing and that is why they are utilized for business purposes. Most commercial companies need to do marketing in social networks in order to introduce their goods and/or services. In marketing, appropriate and accurate advertisement of goods based on needs of users of these social networks is required to sell the goods of different companies and manufacturing units in effective ways. In most cases, however, advertising and marketing methods in social networks are not correct and the resulted advertisements are boring and tiring to users and they might ignore them without noticing. Such advertisements will be considered as spam and will be annoying to network users. This is taken into consideration in the present study where users' interests, attitudes, and behavior on Facebook are specified through data mining techniques, based on which content marketing is conducted. The present study is conducted on the social network of Facebook, where content marketing, a new form of marketing, is utilized and instead of introducing the goods, the contents of different goods are presented. The data utilized in the study are actual and related to Facebook users, and therefore, the results can be generalized to other networks. © 2014, Saman Forouzandeh, Heirsh Soltanpanah, & Amir Sheikhahmadi.",Forouzandeh S.; Soltanpanah H.; Sheikhahmadi A.,Tactical,,Advertisement; Data mining; Decision tree; Marketing; Social networks,5.0,,15,0,University of Tehran,"The study focuses on content marketing strategies on Facebook, analyzing user interests and behaviors to enhance marketing effectiveness, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Content marketing through data mining on Facebook social network,2014
"Identifying dominating features that affect individual information retweeting behavior on social networking sites (SNSs) is crucial to understanding individual retweeting behaivor and developing effective marketing strategies on SNS. However, there is little agreement on what factors are dominating individual information disseminating behavior on SNS, and what’s worse, more and more factors are added into the prediction model, without examining the relevance of them and even why these factors are added is rarely discussed. This leads to undesirable outcomes such as increasing the cost of measuring and computing irrelevant/redundant features. Most importantly, it hinders us from understanding what discriminative features are affecting individual information disseminating behavior. Using a unique real-life Twitter data set consisting of 55,575 twitterers and 9,440,321 tweets, the authors examine what discriminative features are dominating individual information disseminating behavior. The results indicate that topic distance is the most discriminative factor, highlighting that self-presentation motives play an important role in information disseminating decisions. Besides, the amount of information, social relationship and the popularity of the tweet also contribute to individual information disseminating decisions. Experiments demonstrate that adopting only dominating factors can improve prediction performance in terms of various indicators, compared with adopting the full features set. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing theoretical and practical implications of our findings. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017.",Shi J.; Lai K.K.; Hu P.; Chen G.,Tactical,10.1007/s10799-017-0278-8,Data mining; Dominating features; Individual retweeting decisions; Information disseminating behaviour; Online marketing; Social networking sites,5.0,,15,0,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","The abstract discusses identifying factors that influence individual information retweeting behavior on social networking sites, which can inform targeted marketing strategies and user engagement.

"Sales and marketing is the indispensable department of an organization which leads to the generation of revenue and building customer relationship. Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns. This paper discusses the use of the data mining concept on marketing.

"Purpose: This research proposes a new modified Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model by extending the model with spatial analysis for supporting decision-makers in discovering the promotional target market. Research design, data and methodology: This quantitative research utilizes data-mining techniques and the RFM model to cluster a university's provider schools. The RFM model was modified by adapting its variables to the university's marketing context and adding a district's potential (D) variable based on heatmap analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) and K-means clustering. The K-prototype algorithm and the Elbow method were applied to find provider school clusters using the proposed RFM-D model. After profiling the clusters, the target segment was assigned. The model was validated using empirical data from an Indonesian university, and its performance was compared to the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)-based RFM utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. Results: This research identified five clusters. The target segment was chosen from the highest-value and high-value clusters that comprised 17.80% of provider schools but can contribute 75.77% of students. Conclusions: The proposed model recommended more targeted schools in higher-potential districts and predicted the target segment with 0.99 accuracies, outperforming the CLV-based model. The empirical findings help university management determine the promotion location and allocate resources for promotional information distribution and student recruitment. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://Creat¡vecommons.org/l¡censes/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Ernawati; Baharin S.S.K.; Kasmin F.,Tactical,10.15722/jds.20.06.202206.1,Information distribution; Rfm; Spatial analysis; Student recruitment; Target market,5.0,,15,0,Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA),"The research focuses on using a modified RFM model to identify target segments for promotional activities, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"This research presents a new approach to derive recommendations for segment-specific, targeted marketing campaigns on the product category level. The proposed methodological framework serves as a decision support tool for customer relationship managers or direct marketers to select attractive product categories for their target marketing efforts, such as segment-specific rewards in loyalty programs, cross-merchandising activities, targeted direct mailings, customized supplements in catalogues, or customized promotions. The proposed methodology requires customers’ multi-category purchase histories as input data and proceeds in a stepwise manner. It combines various data compression techniques and integrates an optimization approach which suggests candidate product categories for segment-specific targeted marketing such that cross-category spillover effects for non-promoted categories are maximized. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed procedure, we examine the transactions from a real-world loyalty program of a major grocery retailer. A simple scenario-based analysis using promotion responsiveness reported in previous empirical studies and prior experience by domain experts suggests that targeted promotions might boost profitability between 15 % and 128 % relative to an undifferentiated standard campaign. © 2016, The Author(s).",Reutterer T.; Hornik K.; March N.; Gruber K.,Tactical,10.1007/s11573-016-0823-7,Association rule mining; Clustering; Cross-category purchases; Customized coupons; Target marketing,5.0,,10,0,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The abstract describes a methodological framework that provides decision support for customer relationship managers to select attractive product categories for targeted marketing campaigns.

"Analyzing and extracting insights from user-generated data has become a topic of interest among businesses and research groups because such data contains valuable information, e.g., consumers’ opinions, ratings, and recommendations of products and services. However, the true value of social media data is rarely discovered due to overloaded information. Existing literature in analyzing online hotel reviews mainly focuses on a single data resource, lexicon, and analysis method and rarely provides marketing insights and decision-making information to improve business’ service and quality of products. We propose an integrated framework which includes a data crawler, data preprocessing, sentiment-sensitive tree construction, convolution tree kernel classification, aspect extraction and category detection, and visual analytics to gain insights into hotel ratings and reviews. The empirical findings show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms as well as well-known sentiment classification methods, and achieves high precision (0.95) and recall (0.96). The visual analytics results reveal that Business travelers tend to give lower ratings, while Couples tend to give higher ratings. In general, users tend to rate lowest in July and highest in December. The Business travelers more frequently use negative keywords, such as “rude,” “terrible,” “horrible,” “broken,” and “dirty,” to express their dissatisfied emotions toward their hotel stays in July. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chang Y.-C.; Ku C.-H.; Chen C.-H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.11.001,Google trends; Hospitality; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; TripAdvisor; Visual analytics,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses an integrated framework for analyzing user-generated data and provides insights into hotel ratings and reviews which can be used for marketing analytics, user engagement, and decision-making at a structured level, making it fit for tactical classification.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Social media analytics: Extracting and visualizing Hilton hotel ratings and reviews from TripAdvisor,2019
"Social media data contain rich information in posts or comments written by customers. If those data can be extracted and analysed properly, companies can fully utilise this rich source of information. They can then convert the data to useful information or knowledge, which can help to formulate their business strategy. This cannot only facilitate marketing research in view of customer behaviour, but can also aid other management disciplines. Operations management (OM) research and practice with the objective to make decisions on product and process design is a fine example. Nevertheless, this line of thought is under-researched. In this connection, this paper explores the role of social media data in OM research.

"Telecommunication industry has proven itself as a chain of socio-economic impact. Market leaders should take advantage of data analysis consecutively as the need to sustain customers the longest possible time. This research is based on community detection analysis through identifying group members and influencers in the telecommunication industry. It is motivated by two major research questions: Who are th e influencers in subscribers for churn and new products adoptions? (2) Who are subscribers whose loyalty is threatened by churn around them? The use of data analysis and data mining algorithms and standard process in today‘s challenges was set to increase the efficiency of solving not only technical problems but business as to move toward insights and analysis based exercises. This research proposes a model based on the Similarity, Authority and Hub algorithms used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) to group members who share same patterns together, to identify network leaders in terms of authority and dissemination leaders and to extract group level insights that can be used in understanding subscribers‘ patterns and ways of communications (in-degrees and out-degrees) between them using IBM SPSS Modeler as the base of data mining process and Oracle as the base of corporate data warehouse. This study estimated how much reliable is to use SNA in order to shift from the traditional ways of targeting subscribers, understanding their pattern, enhancing offering efficiency and improving the process of launching new product by selecting the right target. It has contributed to shifting marketing leaders‘ way of thinking from individual view to network view.

"The role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in disseminating and protecting children’s rights is fundamental by increasing society’s knowledge about the reality that children face, thus mobilizing citizen attention. In this paper, we present an original study on social media data, specifically Twitter, to analyze childhood NGOs, evaluating the success of their content (through the likes obtained by publications) from the perspective of social marketing and prospective theory. In addition, it examines the positioning of organizations concerning the types of messages identified. The methodological approach is based on data mining, content analysis, and simple correspondence analysis through which the typology of the messages and positioning map are determined. The results suggest that these organizations generate predictable communication by publishing on specific topics and only increasing the number of tweets in emergencies when they are requiring urgent help. Some tweets show an immediate risk to which children are exposed if they do not receive help, which aligns with one of the premises of the Prospect Theory. Furthermore, a more significant number of posts does not necessarily imply a greater number of likes. Three types of messages have been determined: informative tweets that point out risks (type 1), impartial dialogue tweets (type 2), and action tweets that highlight benefits (type 3), confirmed through the Kruskal-Wallis test to have a relationship with impact. The positioning map shows that type 3 messages, which World Vision Spain opts for, are the most popular, followed by type 1, which Educo leans towards. Finally, there are those of type 2, with which UNICEF Spain is associated. The main implication is that our analysis validates the use of social media such as Twitter to analyze NGOs and proposes these social media platforms to be an important tool in mobilizing the community. In addition, this study offers parameters when constructing the messages for use in social marketing campaigns according to decisions that involve risk or certainty. © The Author(s) 2024.",Galiano-Coronil A.; Alcedo-Velázquez M.Y.; Blanco-Moreno S.; Tobar Pesántez L.B.,Tactical,10.1057/s41599-024-02611-7,,5.0,,15,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses the analysis of social media data and the effectiveness of different types of tweets from NGOs, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into structured actions, such as content optimization and user engagement in social media.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Comparison and positioning of NGOs aimed at children from the perspective of social marketing on Twitter,2024
"Banks apply credit scoring to identify customers with low credit risk. Additionally, recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM) analysis method is suitable for identifying valuable bank customers. Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns hidden in customer data. However, in previous research, data mining has been used separately in both credit scoring and RFM approaches. To evaluate customer behaviour, banks must employ credit scoring and RFM analysis method, simultaneously. This study proposes a framework for using data mining techniques to integrate credit scoring and RFM methods in the field of banking. In this framework, k-means had better performance than Kohonen network and DBSCAN to identify and cluster valuable customers based on the RFM and credit scoring indices. Moreover, the C5 decision tree, BN, and SVM with 94.10%, 92.71%, and 92.36% accuracy had better performance to classify valuable bank customers based on RFM and credit scoring indices.

"Direct marketing campaigns are one of the main fundraising sources for nonprofit organizations and their effectiveness is crucial for the sustainability of the organizations. The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted.

"Purpose: This study aims to analyze communication from the perspective of social marketing, positive emotions, and the topics chosen by Spanish tourist destinations to show their destination image. Additionally, this research shows a message classification model, based on the aforementioned characteristics, that has generated a greater impact, offering clarity to tourism managers on the type of content they should publish to achieve greater visibility. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in this work combines content analysis and data mining techniques. The classification tree using the chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm was selected to determine predictors of like behaviour. Findings: The results show that the predictor variables have been emotions, social marketing and topics. Also, the characteristics of the messages most likely to have a high impact are those related to emotions of joy or happiness, their purpose is behavioural, and they talk about rural, cultural issues, special dates, getaways, or highlights of a town or city for something specific. Originality/value: This study is the first to analyze the content of the tweets shared by destination tourism managers from a social marketing, positive emotions, and sustainability perspective, determining the possible predictors of likes on Twitter.

"This study proposes a framework for assisting decision-makers in selecting a target market using a Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) based model. This study aims to identify a university's promotional target market for student recruitment and develop a geo-marketing strategy. This study employed a modified RFM model tailored to the university's marketing context, combining it with spatial analysis to quantify feeder schools ""value"" and temporal analysis to examine the enrollment patterns of the highest value feeder schools using data mining techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS). A case study of an Indonesian university was used in this study. This study identified 108 (4.63%) out of 2,334 feeder schools as the prioritized target market, contributing 51.54% of 18,537 enrolled students to the university during the analysis period. The prioritized feeder schools are in 32 cities and 23 regencies from 368 cities/regencies, with the majority being private schools. The research's findings revealed the distribution of feeder schools in regencies/cities and the trend of enrolled students from the highest value feeder schools segment, which can assist university management in selecting target feeder schools more precisely. Based on the findings, decision-makers can create a geo-marketing strategy for promotional activities and direct resources to the prioritized feeder schools.

"With the development of e-commerce platforms, online customer reviews have become an important instrument for providing product word-of-mouth (WoM) information. Analyzing and measuring WoM is quite valuable in product design, sales prediction, marketing strategy, and other decision-making tasks. In contrast to previous studies that analyze product WoM focusing on a single product, we propose an influence framework to measure WoM from a market perspective. In this framework, we combine product competition relationships and customer intercommunication relationships to construct a two-layer network and calculate the node influence effects in the network. To compare different product WoM measures, we use product sales as a predictor and build a series of predictive models. In the experiments conducted based on Amazon.com data, we find that, first, textual sentiment analysis produces a better summary of customer opinions than rating scores. Second, product-comparative relationships provide additional information on measuring product WoM. Third, the customer intercommunication feature in social media is useful for measuring the collective opinions about a product. The influence framework and experimental findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Chen K.; Luo P.; Wang H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.im.2016.06.010,Product network; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses an influence framework for measuring product word-of-mouth (WoM) from a market perspective, which involves analyzing customer reviews and product competition.

"Identification of changes in customer behavior is a major challenge that must be tackled in order to survive in a rapidly changing business environment. For example, because information technology has advanced and data-storage costs have declined, for the purpose of serving customers, numerous enterprises have employed information systems and have directly logged customer behavior in databases. This trend has motivated the development of data mining applications. Fuzzy quantitative sequential pattern mining is a functional data mining technique that is used for discovering customer behavioral patterns over time and determining the quantities of goods or services they purchase. The example term used in shopping 〈[(Beer, Low)(Milk, High)] (Cola, Middle)〉 means that customers will first buy Beer and Milk in Low and High quantities, respectively, and then purchase Cola in Middle quantities on their next shopping trip, where Low, Middle, and High are predefined linguistic terms assigned by managers. A term such as this one provides managers with general and concise knowledge related to customer behavior and allows them to rapidly make decisions in response, especially in a competitive setting. However, literature searches indicate that no previous study has addressed the issue of changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. The aforementioned example pattern might have been available last year but might not be used this year, and it could have been substituted by 〈(Beer, Middle) {(Cola, Low)(Milk, Low)}〉. If this knowledge is not renewed, managers might develop inappropriate marketing plans for their products or services and use inventory strategies that are outdated with respect to time and quantities. To solve this problem, we propose a novel change-mining model that can be used for detecting changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. We conducted experiments in which we used real-world and synthetic datasets in order to evaluate the proposed model. When the pattern change was detected using the real-world dataset, the results showed that the model reveals 3 considerations that can help managers with their handling of products’ marketing and production. When we studied the model’s scalability by using the synthetic dataset, the results showed that even though all run times increased when parameter values were decreased, the model remained scalable. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Huang C.-K.; Chang T.-Y.; Narayanan B.G.,Tactical,10.1007/s10799-014-0197-x,Change mining; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Quantitative data; Sequential patterns,5.0,,15,0,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses a novel change-mining model for detecting changes in customer behavioral patterns, which is aimed at helping managers make informed decisions regarding marketing and inventory strategies.

"Retailers are facing challenges in making sense of the significant amount of data available for a better understanding of their customers. While retail analytics plays an increasingly important role in successful retailing management, comprehensive store segmentation based on Data Mining-based Retail Analytics is still an under-researched area. This study seeks to address this gap by developing a novel approach to segment the stores of retail chains based on ‘purchasing behavior of customers’ and applying it in a case study. The applicability and benefits of using Data Mining techniques to examine purchasing behavior and identify store segments are demonstrated in a case study of a global retail chain in Istanbul, Turkey. Over 600 K transaction data of a global grocery retailer are analyzed and 175 stores in Istanbul are successfully segmented into five segments. The results suggest that the proposed new retail analytics approach enables the retail chain to identify clusters of stores in different regions using all transaction data and advances our understanding of store segmentation at the store level. The proposed approach will provide the retail chain the opportunity to manage store clusters by making data-driven decisions in marketing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, inventory management and demand forecasting. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bilgic E.; Cakir O.; Kantardzic M.; Duan Y.; Cao G.,Tactical,10.1080/09593969.2021.1915847,business analytics; Data mining; data-driven decision making; purchasing behavior; store segmentation,5.0,,10,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on applying data mining techniques to segment stores based on customer purchasing behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in retail management.

"Customer response models have gained popularity due to their ability to significantly improve the likelihood of targeting the customers most likely to buy a product or a service. These models are built using databases of previous customers’ buying decisions. However, a smaller number of customers in these databases often bought the product or service than those who did not do so, resulting in unbalanced datasets. This problem is especially significant for online marketing campaigns when the class imbalance emerges due to many website sessions. Unbalanced datasets pose a specific challenge in data-mining modelling due to the inability of most of the algorithms to capture the characteristics of the classes that are unrepresented in the dataset. This paper proposes an approach based on a combination of random undersampling and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification applied to the unbalanced dataset to create a Balanced SVM (B-SVM) data pre-processor resulting in a dataset that is analysed with several classifiers. The experiments indicate that using the B-SVM strategy combined with classification methods increases the base models’ predictive performance, indicating that the B-SVM approach efficiently pre-processes the data, correcting noise and class imbalance. Hence, companies may use the B-SVM approach to more efficiently select customers more likely to respond to a campaign. © 2022 by the authors.",Rogić S.; Kašćelan L.; Pejić Bach M.,Tactical,10.3390/jtaer17030051,customer response model; data mining; data pre-processing; direct marketing; support vector machine; unbalanced data,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses the application of a specific method (B-SVM) to enhance predictive performance in targeting customers for marketing campaigns, which fits within the tactical decision-making level by interpreting strategic goals into actionable models.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Customer Response Model in Direct Marketing: Solving the Problem of Unbalanced Dataset with a Balanced Support Vector Machine,2022

"Facing the problem of variation and chaotic behavior of customers, the lack of sufficient information is a challenge to many business organizations. Human analysts lacking an understanding of the hidden patterns in business data, thus, can miss corporate business opportunities. In order to embrace all business opportunities, enhance the competitiveness, discovery of hidden knowledge, unexpected patterns and useful rules from large databases have provided a feasible solution for several decades. While there is a wide range of financial analysis products existing in the financial market, how to customize the investment portfolio for the customer is still a challenge to many financial institutions. This paper aims at developing an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) for extracting customer behavior in the financial industry, so as to increase the availability of decision support data and hence increase customer satisfaction. The proposed financial model first clusters the customers into several sectors, and then finds the correlation among these sectors. It is noted that better customer segmentation can increase the ability to identify targeted customers, therefore extracting useful rules for specific clusters can provide an insight into customers' buying behavior and marketing implications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a simple dataset is collected from a financial company in Hong Kong. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can improve the workflow of a financial company, but also deepen understanding of investment behavior. Thus, a corporation is able to customize the most suitable products and services for customers on the basis of the rules extracted.",Mak M.K.Y.; Ho G.T.S.; Ting S.L.,Tactical,10.5772/50937,Association rules mining; Clustering; Customer behavior; Data mining; Financial industry,5.0,,15,0,InTech Europe,"The abstract discusses the development of an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) aimed at improving customer segmentation and behavior analysis, which aligns with tactical decision-making in targeting and personalization efforts within the financial industry.",scopus-data mining,10,70,A financial data mining model for extracting customer behavior,2011
"In e-commerce, online product reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and the marketing strategies employed by vendors. However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results; (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers; and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Zheng X.; Zhu S.; Lin Z.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2013.06.002,Online review; Review mining; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Social network,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses a semi-supervised system for classifying online product reviews, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Product recommendation is a business activity that is critical in attracting customers. Accordingly, improving the quality of a recommendation to fulfill customers' needs is important in fiercely competitive environments. Although various recommender systems have been proposed, few have addressed the lifetime value of a customer to a firm. Generally, customer lifetime value (CLV) is evaluated in terms of recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) variables. However, the relative importance among them varies with the characteristics of the product and industry. We developed a novel product recommendation methodology that combined group decision-making and data mining techniques. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to determine the relative weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. Clustering techniques were then employed to group customers according to the weighted RFM value. Finally, an association rule mining approach was implemented to provide product recommendations to each customer group. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach outperformed one with equally weighted RFM and a typical collaborative filtering (CF) method. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"The development of the network economy has transformed business practices. A major shift occurs in the marketing efforts. Given the abundant information on customers and products, marketing responsibility has changed from managing products for sellers to managing relationships with customers, and to facilitating decision-making for customers. These marketing efforts are essentially an intermediary of two-way communication between businesses and customers, and they would require data analysis techniques. Particularly through data mining, which comprises techniques for the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, organisations are able to identify valuable customers, predict future behaviours, and allow firms to make proactive, knowledge driven decisions. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each method having its advantages and disadvantages for different types of marketing purposes. This paper examines the issue of applying different techniques to meet the marketing requirements in the network economy.

"Business marketers widely use data mining for segmenting and targeting markets. To assess data mining for use by political marketers, we mined the 1948 to 2004 American National Elections Studies data file to identify a small number of variables and rules that can be used to predict individual voting behavior, including abstention, with the intent of segmenting the electorate in useful and meaningful ways. The resulting decision tree correctly predicts vote choice with 66 percent accuracy, a success rate that compares favorably with other predictive methods. More importantly, the process provides rules that identify segments of voters based on their predicted vote choice, with the vote choice of some segments predictable with up to 87 percent success. These results suggest that the data mining methodology may increase efficiency for political campaigns, but they also suggest that, from a democratic theory perspective, overall participation may be improved by communicating more effective messages that better inform intended voters and that motivate individuals to vote who otherwise may abstain. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Murray G.R.; Scime A.,Tactical,10.1080/15377857.2010.497732,Campaign strategy; Classification; Data mining; Domain expert; Domain knowledge; Microtargeting; Political marketing; Vote choice; Voting behavior,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of data mining techniques to segment and target voters, which aligns with tactical marketing approaches that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.

"In today's digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset, and the implementation of knowledge management supports a company in developing innovative products and making critical management strategic decisions. Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely researched. To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer knowledge management for innovative product development. In the knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract customer knowledge from different market segments.

"As the first phase of quality function deployment (QFD) and the only interface between the customers and product development team, house of quality (HOQ) plays the most important role in developing quality products that are able to satisfy customer needs. No matter in what shape or form HOQ can be built, the key to this process is to find out the hidden relationship between customers' requirements and product design specifications. This paper presents a general rough set based data mining approach for HOQ analysis. It utilises the historical information of customer needs and the design specifications of the product that was purchased, employs the basic rough set notions to reveal the interrelationships between customer needs and design specifications automatically. Due to the data reduction nature of the approach, a minimal set of customer needs that are crucial for the decision on the correlated design specifications is derived. The end result of the approach is in the form of a minimal rule set, which not only fulfils the goal of HOQ, but can be used as supporting data for marketing purposes.

"Despite the popular use of social media by consumers and marketers, empirical research investigating their economic values still lags. In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior.

"Previous studies on mining association rules focus on discovering associations among items without considering the relationships between items and their purchased quantities. However, exploring associations among items associated with their purchased quantities may discover information useful to improve the quality of business decisions. In this paper, we investigate the issue of mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions. When purchased quantities are considered, the supports of items associated with their purchased quantities may decrease drastically, and the number of potentially interesting association rules discovered will be few. In order to discover more potentially interesting rules, we present two partition algorithms to partition all the possible quantities into intervals for each item. We also propose an efficient mechanism to discover all the large itemsets from the partitioned data. Experimental results show that by our approach, the total execution time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, the potentially interesting rule discovered from the partitioned data can be considered to be a kind of generalized association rule. The generalized association rule is useful in marketing, business management and decision making, especially when the information from the rules generated from the original data is limited.",Tsai P.S.M.; Chen C.-M.,Tactical,,Data mining; Large q_itemset generation; Partition scheme; Performance study; Quantitative association rule,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the mining of quantitative association rules from sales transaction data to improve business decision-making, which aligns with tactical goals such as marketing analytics and sales promotion.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions,2001
"Much has been written about word of mouth and customer behavior. Telephone call detail records provide a novel way to understand the strength of the relationship between individuals. In this paper, we predict using call detail records the impact that the behavior of one customer has on another customer's decisions. We study this in the context of churn (a decision to leave a communication service provider) and cross-buying decisions based on an anonymized data set from a telecommunications provider. Call detail records are represented as a weighted graph and a novel statistical learning technique, Markov logic networks, is used in conjunction with logit models based on lagged neighborhood variables to develop the predictive model. In addition, we propose an approach to propositionalization tailored to predictive modeling with social network data. The results show that information on the churn of network neighbors has a significant positive impact on the predictive accuracy and in particular the sensitivity of churn models. The results provide evidence that word of mouth has a considerable impact on customers' churn decisions and also on the purchase decisions, leading to a 19.5% and 8.4% increase in sensitivity of predictive models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These systems can automatically capture data on the browsing histories and purchasing records of individual customers. This capability has motivated the development of data-mining applications. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a useful data-mining method to discover customers' purchasing patterns over time. We incorporate the recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) concept presented in the marketing literature to define the RFM sequential pattern and develop a novel algorithm for generating all RFM sequential patterns from customers' purchasing data. Using the algorithm, we propose a pattern segmentation framework to generate valuable information on customer purchasing behavior for managerial decision-making. Extensive experiments are carried out, using synthetic datasets and a transactional dataset collected by a retail chain in Taiwan, to evaluate the proposed algorithm and empirically demonstrate the benefits of using RFM sequential patterns in analyzing customers' purchasing data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"In the era of Web 2.0, with the social media's advantage, many creative e-commerce modes based on online or offline social networks emerged, such as social buying and viral marketing. Social network analysis provides a powerful set of tools for modelling social networks to understand their structure and behaviour. However, current challenge is that the target environments involve large amounts of relational data that characterise multi-entities, time-sensitive, decision-making situations. To understand the structure and the dynamic mechanisms of the complex real-world system, the researchers need innovative network modelling approaches and analysis techniques. This paper first proposes a social buying metanetwork model, and then provides a methodology framework integrated business intelligence techniques with dynamic network analysis tools, finally the case study describes the process on metanetwork modelling, dynamic network analysis, and buyer behaviour pattern mining.

"A study of the online browsing and purchasing habits of some 1,400 outbound travelers in Hong Kong demonstrates the analytical power of weight-of-evidence (WOE) data mining. The WOE approach allows analysts to identify and transform the variables with the most predictive power regarding the likelihood of tourists' online preferences and decisions. The study found that just over one-third of the respondents browsed hotel-related websites, and about half of those browsers had booked a room on those sites. Browsers in Hong Kong tended to be young, well educated, and well traveled. Those who used the hotel websites for purchases were, of course, part of the browser group, and were likewise relatively well educated. However, one unexpected variable set off those who used the websites for a hotel purchase, the length of their most recent trip. One possible reason is that long-haul tourists want to be sure of their accommodations, or this may reflect hotels' free-night offers. The convenient use of model-based customer segmentation and decision rules would help hospitality practitioners effectively manage their marketing resources and activities, and enhance information-based marketing strategies to attract target customers. © The Author(s) 2013.",Wu E.H.C.; Law R.; Jiang B.,Tactical,10.1177/1938965512468225,data mining; hotel website; information technology; prediction; travel behavior; weight of evidence,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses the analytical approach to understanding online browsing and purchasing habits, as well as how this data can inform marketing strategies, indicating a focus on specific targets and actions within a marketing framework.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Predicting Browsers and Purchasers of Hotel Websites: A Weight-of-Evidence Grouping Approach,2013

This article reviews basic recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) methods on a set of data involving the sale of beef products. Variants of RFM are demonstrated. Classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks are also demonstrated. Results indicate a spectrum of tradeoffs. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. Considerations of balancing cell sizes as well as compressing data are examined. Both balancing expected cell densities as well as compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide more accurate models.

"Purpose - The cost of retaining a customer is lower than that of obtaining a new one, so potential customer defection is an important issue in the fiercely competitive environment of electronic commerce. Accordingly, this paper aims to present a new way for gauging customer loyalty and predicting their possibility of defection reference to a set of quality attributes satisfaction and three types of belief in the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/ approach - The performance of the classification utilization artificial neural networks (ANNs) was compared to that of traditional analytic tools, such as multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and classificatory data mining technique - decision tree. Findings - The analytical result represented that the predicted accuracy of ANNs is better then MDA and decision tree in both training and testing phases. Degree of repurchase intention has been classified correctly with a success rate of 83 percent using neural networks. Research limitations/implications - Like all research, this study has its limitations. One such limitation is that the predictive model was designed for application to online bookstores. A further limitation of this survey is that it reflects intentions instead of actual behavior. Finally, despite of ANNs has been applied to numerous areas and have demonstrated a degree of classification success, it is difficult to extract rules for explanation.

"Given the trend that international corporations are utilizing various information systems for their daily activities, information on sales transactions together with corresponding customer profile is usually available in airlines and international hotel chains. This allows segments of customers to be drawn according to selected relevant demographic variables. This is referred to as Database Marketing, a new trend in marketing that makes use of information available in a company's database. The extracted information is also useful in planning marketing strategies, launching new products/services and defining market segmentation.As databases in large corporations nowadays are getting large, sparser, more free-formatted and more dynamic, traditional statistical techniques may not be capable of extracting the encapsulated knowledge inside the databases. A new technical stream, data mining has been developed in Computer Science to deal with the complex task of extracting and managing any potential knowledge embedded inside databases. This paper introduces the common techniques in data mining, including decision tree classifiers, regression analysis, induction programming logic, and probabilistic rules. Suggestions are offered about how these techniques can be used in order to improve the engineering behind Database Marketing, which can help to promote niche markets in tourism.

"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to provide a data mining approach for classifying Taiwanese healthcare institutions based on customer value assessment. Each institution type has developed its own marketing strategy along with relationship management strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Real transaction data from 88 pharmaceutical companies were the study samples. Expert interviews were conducted to analyze industry knowledge. The frequency, money, and contract term (FMC) model was developed to assess and segment the healthcare institutions. ANOVA and the Scheffe post-test were used to explore the test effects of each FMC indicator among the groups. The C5.0 decision tree was then used to generate the behavioral rules of various segmentations. Finally, this study combined the related variables with the purchasing behavioral rules to propose specific strategies for each type of healthcare institution. Findings - A total of 663 health care institutions in Taiwan were divided into four types: loyalist, intellectualist, nitpicking, and churn. The terms frequency (F), money (M) and contract term (C) were all significant indicators for determining the differences among the four customer categories at the 0.01 level of significance. The behavioral rules related to the four categories were determined by using the C5.0 algorithm.

"More and more consumers are relying on online opinions when making purchasing decisions. For this reason, companies must have knowledge of the actual standing of their products on the Web. A warning system for online market research is being proposed which allows the identification of critical situations in online opinion formation. When critical situations are detected, warnings are subsequently sent to marketing managers and thus allowing marketers the ability to initiate preventive measures. The warning system operates on a knowledge base which contains product-related success values, online opinions and patterns of social interactions. This knowledge is acquired using methods coming from information extraction, text mining and social network analysis. Based on this knowledge the warning system judges situations accordingly. For this purpose, a neuro-fuzzy approach is chosen which learns linguistic rules from data. These rules are employed to estimate future situations. The warning system is applied to two scenarios and yields good results. An evaluation shows that all components of the warning system outperform alternative methods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Decision support techniques and models for marketing decisions are critical to retail success. Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine a comprehensive model of millennial usage of interactive technologies in the current marketing environment based upon actual behavior. Design/methodology/approach: A data mining approach using decision tree analysis (DTA) generates two comparative models (i.e. millennial versus generation X and millennial versus baby boomers) of interactive media usage across 21 technology applications. A large national sample (n=3,289) sourced from the Kantar Retail IQ constitutes the data for the models. Findings: Millennial respondents indicate significantly higher usage of interactive media compared to both generation X and boomers across 14 applications. Models indicate that millennials use interactive technologies for utilitarian/information gathering purposes as well as for entertainment. However, they are less likely to purchase online compared to their older counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Models provide evidence that both supports and extends previous research into interactive media from a uses and gratifications perspective. Findings suggest theoretical directions for research for economic versus emotional uses of interactive media.

"Measuring the success of targeted marketing actions is challenging. Research on prescriptive analytics recommends uplift models to guide targeting decisions. Uplift models predict how much a marketing action will change customers' behavior, known as the individual treatment effect (ITE). Marketers can then solicit customers in decreasing order of their estimated ITE. We argue that the ITE-based targeting policy is not fully consistent with a business value maximization objective. We propose business-centric evaluation metrics that integrate estimates of the ITE and the expected business value and validate their benefits relative to the ITE-based targeting baseline using real-world marketing data. The new metrics yield remarkably higher profit across different uplift models, targeting depths, profit functions, and data sets.

"What good is the most scientifically valuable analysis if it piles up in marketers’ inboxes but does not give them the necessary foundation for their decisions? Such a situation is no use to data scientists and certainly no use to the marketing team. The root of the issue is that two worlds meet here that speak completely different languages. Only if data scientists can ‘translate’ their results into marketing language will their work be successful. Marketing teams do not need as much information as possible; rather, they require just the right information, preferably with recommendations for action that can guide their decisions. To select the information that is truly useful for marketing and communicate it in an understandable way, data scientists must have more than expertise in analytics methods and tools (which is assumed and therefore not discussed in detail here); they also need to know about marketing objectives and have a comprehensive contextual understanding of their company’s industry and sector, including competitors. Knowledge of the general situation in the world as well as the legal, political and religious particularities of the countries in which the company operates is also required.

"Persona is a common human-computer interaction technique for increasing stakeholders’ understanding of audiences, customers, or users. Applied in many domains, such as e-commerce, health, marketing, software development, and system design, personas have remained relatively unchanged for several decades. However, with the increasing popularity of digital user data and data science algorithms, there are new opportunities to progressively shift personas from general representations of user segments to precise interactive tools for decision-making. In this vision, the persona profile functions as an interface to a fully functional analytics system. With this research, we conceptually investigate how data-driven personas can be leveraged as analytics tools for understanding users. We present a conceptual framework consisting of (a) persona benefits, (b) analytics benefits, and (c) decision-making outcomes. We apply this framework for an analysis of digital marketing use cases to demonstrate how data-driven personas can be leveraged in practical situations. We then present a functional overview of an actual data-driven persona system that relies on the concept of data aggregation in which the fundamental question defines the unit of analysis for decision-making. The system provides several functionalities for stakeholders within organizations to address this question. © 2020 Bernard J.

"When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the ""winning model"" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the ""legwork"" of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e.g., the ""back-and-forth"" migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e.g., the inclusion of an ""off"" state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general ""recipe"" for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework). © 2014 INFORMS.",Schwartz E.M.; Bradlow E.T.; Fader P.S.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2013.0825,Business intelligence; Classification tree; Data science; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Hierarchical Bayesian methods; Machine learning; Model selection; Posterior predictive model checking; Random forest,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a decision tree tool that helps analysts select the appropriate model for forecasting repeat purchasing, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and purchase prediction.",scopus-data science,10,70,Model selection using database characteristics: Developing a classification tree for longitudinal incidence data,2014
"The life insurance industry is inherently a data-driven industry with various applications for analytical decision-making. Data science has influenced all business functions in an insurance organization to provide a distinct competitive advantage and push the industry towards the vision of ‘Insure Tech’. This case revolves around one such application of analytics in HDFC analytics dealing with championing the initiative for forecasting and analysis of Business Persistency. The persistency ratio is actually a fairly simple, yet very important metric that provides a snapshot of the health of the insurance industry. Considering the importance of this parameter, it became extremely important for HDFC Life to understand the factors behind persistency numbers and what lies ahead for the organization. The existing forecasting techniques were biased by the nature of work and did not give a significantly accurate and realistic number. The top management found this to be challenging for decision-making and decided that this required the intervention of the Business Insights department. Mr. Francis Rodrigues, SVP—Data Labs, Business Insights and Innovation was given the task to take over the pilot project and increase usage of analytical tools for Persistency Analysis. While Quarter 1 results have been significant, Mr. Francis Rodrigues still wonders whether he captured all the internal and external measures to obtain effective results. Has he done enough and how many more areas can analytics be applied for in the insurance domain? Research Question/Purpose: The current methods of persistency calculation are biased by the nature of work and deflect by a huge margin from the numbers actually achieved. There are no realistic forecasts for the coming year making the management uncertain with the decisions they take for strategic purposes. Theory: Time-indexed collection data help in predicting persistency numbers which are also influenced by some important variables behind collection follow-up and categories of customers. Type of the Case: Applied problem solving. Protagonist: Not needed. Options: Due to the availability of time-indexed data, time series was considered to be the best approach to forecast values into the future. However, that would only solve one half of the problem. It was also important to understand the parameters affecting persistency numbers, important variables behind persistency collections and classify the customers based on such variables. With this knowledge, classification models were also taken into consideration. Discussions and Case Questions: Besides time-indexed collection data which other variables amongst policy and demographic parameters influence persistency parameters? How can insights be drawn about the factors that are actually affecting the persistency numbers? Will calculating and sharing monthly persistency numbers for the coming year improve the percentage of customers remitting payment on time? By classifying customers into various categories with regards to the frequency of follow-up required for premium collection can a favourable segment be carved out? © 2020 SAGE Publications.",Karulkar Y.; Jain S.,Tactical,10.1177/2277977920958573,business insights; data analytics; financial analytics; Life insurance; marketing analytics; persistency; sales forecasting; time series analysis,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The case focuses on improving the persistency ratio through analytical decision-making, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into structured targets.

"This article describes a data-driven case study for teaching and assessing students’ skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This case study combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit. We test the case study in a marketing analytics exam and discuss the performance of 134 students. Beyond assessing student performance in an exam, the case study facilitates teaching through in-class group work or assignments.

"Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms significantly impact the acceptance of products offered by companies. In this paper we propose a software system based on fuzzy logic for estimating the level of perception of users of ecommerce portals regarding a product or service. The constructed system receives as its first input the level of perception of opinion, determined through sentiment analysis, while the second input is the star rating provided by each user for the product or service. For the development of the proposed fuzzy system, the RAD (Rapid Application Development) methodology was used. The fuzzy system presented in this paper aims to support decision making in the marketing divisions of companies with respect to the products and services offered. © 2023 Gabriel Elias Chanchi G., Manuel Alejandro Ospina A. & Manuel Saba; published by UIKTEN.

"Sales forecasting plays a very prominent role in business strategy. Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed statistical methods, such as regression or autoregressive and moving average (ARMA). However, sales forecasting is very complicated owing to influence by internal and external environments. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have also been applied in sales forecasting since their promising performances in the areas of control and pattern recognition. However, further improvement is still necessary since unique circumstances, e.g., promotion, cause a sudden change in the sales pattern. Thus, this study utilizes fuzzy logic a proposed fuzzy neural network (FNN) for the sake of learning fuzzy IF-THEN rules obtained from the marketing experts with respect to promotion. The result from FNN is further integrated with the forecast from ANN using the time series data and the promotion length through the other ANN.

"Purpose: Quantitative objective studies on the problem of celebrity selection are lacking. Furthermore, existing research does not recognize the group decision-making nature and the possibility of customer involvement in celebrity or influencer selection for social media marketing. This study conceptualizes celebrity selection as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem while deriving the final ranking of celebrities/influencers using interactive and flexible criteria based on the value tradeoff approach. The article thus proposes and demonstrates a quantitative objective method of celebrity selection for a brand or campaign in an interactive manner incorporating customer's preferences as well. Design/methodology/approach: Each decision-maker's preferences for celebrity selection criteria are objectively captured and converted into an overall group preference using a modified generalized fuzzy evaluation method (MGFEM). The final ranking of celebrities is then derived from an interactive and criteria-based value tradeoff approach using the flexible and interactive tradeoff method. Findings: The approach gives a different ranking of celebrities for two campaigns based on group members' perceived importance of the selection criteria in different scenarios. This group includes decision-makers (DMs) from the brand, marketing communication agency and brand's customers. Further, each group member has an almost equal say in the decision-making based on fuzzy evaluation and an interactive and flexible value tradeoff approach to celebrity selection for receiving a rank order. Research limitations/implications: The approach uses secondary data on celebrities and hypothetical scenarios. Comparison with other methods is difficult, as no other study proposes a multi-criteria group decision-making approach to celebrity selection especially in a social media context. Practical implications: This approach can help DMs make more informed, objective and effective decisions on celebrity selection for their brands or campaigns. It recognizes that there are multiple stakeholders, including the end customers, each of whose views is objectively considered in the aspects of group decision-making through a fuzzy evaluation method. Further, this study provides a selection mechanism for a given context of endorsement by objectively and interactively encapsulating stakeholder preferences. Originality/value: This robust and holistic approach to celebrity selection can help DMs objectively make consensual decisions with partial or complete information. This quantitative approach contributes to the literature on selection mechanisms of influencers, celebrities, social media opinion leaders etc. by providing a methodological aid that encompasses aspects of interactive group decision-making for a given context. Moreover, this method is useful to DMs and stakeholders in understanding and incorporating the effect of nature or context of the brand and the campaign type in the selection of a celebrity or an influencer. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Shukla S.; Dubey A.,Tactical,10.1108/JRIM-04-2020-0074,Celebrity selection; FITradeoff; Fuzzy logic; Group decision-making; Multi-attribute; Social media marketing campaign,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study presents a method for celebrity selection that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets, employing a multi-attribute group decision-making approach.

"This paper contributes to the discourse on how to determine tourist satisfaction. The aim therefore is to analyze to what extent international tourists visiting South Africa are satisfied by using fuzzy numbers. The measurement of satisfaction with tourist destinations (DSAT)is based on a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (F-MCDM)model that evaluates DSAT according to a number of different segments based on gender, age, and mother tongue. We find empirical evidence for DSAT differences between the segments considered in the analysis. Results show that females are more satisfied than males; tourists between 56 and 65 years old are the most satisfied, while millennials younger than 35 are the least satisfied; English mother-tongue speakers are more satisfied than other tourists. Our findings have clear implications for DMOs' managers regarding the design of marketing campaigns for South African destinations, especially for those segments analyzed in the study.

"Purpose: Beside the development of technology and accessibility, ease of use, ability to reach various products and compare many products at the same time make online shopping even more popular. Despite the great advantages provided by online shopping for either consumers or retailers, there are certain issues that must be solved to improve online shopping advantages. Finding right size is one of the biggest barriers against apparel online retailing. Since the use of apparels is directly related with fitting, choosing right size is becoming more critical for retailers and consumers. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the solution of the problem. Design/methodology/approach: For the study, the specific size measurements of male shirts (collar, shoulder, chest, waist, arm length in cm) from four different sizes (small, medium, large, x-large) and from eight different brands were collected and stored in a database. Totally, weight, height and body measurements (collar, shoulder, chest, waist and arm length in cm) of 80 male candidates, between the ages of 18 and 35, were measured individually. These data were then used for experiments. Findings: Any product with known measurements can be compared with users’ body measurement based on fuzzy logic rule and the best-fitted size can be selected for users. Similarly, using the proposed web design, users are able to see desired products on users with similar body type. Originality/value: In this study, a new mathematical method based on fuzzy relations for apparel size finder is proposed. Beside, this method can group users based on body measurements in order to find people with similar size. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Nasibov E.; Demir M.; Vahaplar A.,Tactical,10.1108/IJCST-06-2018-0077,Apparel size; Fitting; Fuzzy modelling; Online marketing,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a specific method for helping consumers select the right size for apparel in an online shopping context, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at improving user engagement and purchase prediction.",scopus-fuzzy logic,10,70,A fuzzy logic apparel size decision methodology for online marketing,2019

"This paper attempts to build a new model for deciding which social media influencers (SMIs) are suitable for the marketing strategies of businesses. How to choose social media influencers is an unanswered question in the literature, and this study attempts to fill this gap. The study employs a Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model (DEMATEL), to determine the relevance of criteria constructed. It observed SMIs on Instagram and reviewed insights from the literature. Five criteria are proposed for selecting the correct influencers: 1) positioning; 2) target; 3) budget; 4) past campaigns; and 5) the number of followers. Businesses were asked to evaluate these criteria according to their experience with using SMIs. The results suggest that the most important criterion is ‘target’, whereas ‘past campaigns’ is the least influential. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel approach of fuzzy importance-performance analysis (FIPA) to replace conventional importance-performance analysis (IPA) for determining critical service attributes those really need to improve for achieving superior customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach - First, referring numerous studies, conventional IPA has some erroneous assumptions, the customer satisfaction of attribute performance has the characteristic of three-factor theory and the novel approach which integrates natural logarithmic transformation and partial correlation analysis is feasible for acquiring the implicitly derived importance of attributes. Second, according the fact and nature of fuzziness in human perception, this study applies fuzzy set theory to revise conventional IPA. Finally, the FIPA is proposed and subsequently implemented in a Taiwanese hot spring hotel case study. Findings - The implementation of FIPA shows the determined critical service attributes are almost completely different from those attributes acquired by conventional IPA. Hence, the application of conventional IPA may cause practitioners make incorrect decisions of improvement priorities for service attributes and direct unsuitable quality-based marketing strategies. Originality/value - The proposed FIPA which integrates fuzzy set theory, three-factor theory, partial correlation analysis and natural logarithmic transformation avoids the erroneous assumptions of conventional IPA, considers the nature of fuzziness in human perception and includes the actual importance of service attributes.

"Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims to support decision-makers more effectively. This paper presents modifications for the criteria ranking methods, CRITIC and Distance-correlation CRITIC (D-CRITIC). These modifications involve the normalization procedure to silence criteria attribution by utilizing fuzzy logic and the hamming distance. Also, some adjustment to the weighting technique of the CRITIC method is done to capture linear and nonlinear correlations more precisely. These modifications that are applied to the CRITIC method by considering some reference point (RP), produced our proposed (M-CRITIC-RP) method. An illustrative example to rank performance criteria of display advertisement for a digital marketing campaign is used to demonstrate the method's workability. Comparative analysis with appropriate MCDM methods reveals that the distance correlation values for the weights of the M-CRITIC-RP and comparative methods exhibit higher consistency than those between other criteria ranking methods. Moreover, M-CRITIC-RP has a high average value of Spearman rank statistic, indicating high rank consistency. Regarding accuracy, the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) and the Log Accuracy Ratio (LAR) error metrics show lower values for M-CRITIC-RP in comparison to the corresponding values of other criteria ranking methods. M-CRITIC-RP demonstrates sensitivity with changes in the number of alternatives and also to variations in the RPs. The results of the sensitivity analysis guide the analyst to pay ample attention when selecting the RP. Findings also suggest considering a sufficient sample size for better accuracy and consistency of weights and ranks.

"This paper proposes a new intelligent fashion recommender system to select the most relevant garment design scheme for a specific consumer in order to deliver new personalized garment products. This system integrates emotional fashion themes and human perception on personalized body shapes and professional designers' knowledge. The corresponding perceptual data are systematically collected from professional using sensory evaluation techniques. The perceptual data of consumers and designers are formalized mathematically using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The complex relation between human body measurements and basic sensory descriptors, provided by designers, is modeled using fuzzy decision trees. The fuzzy decision trees constitute an empirical model based on learning data measured and evaluated on a set of representative samples. The complex relation between basic sensory descriptors and fashion themes, given by consumers, is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. The combination of the two models can provide more complete information to the fashion recommender system, making it possible to evaluate if a specific body shape is relevant to a desired emotional fashion theme and which garment design scheme can improve the image of the body shape.

"Purpose: This study examines the effect of social media marketing on voting intention applying a combination of fuzzy logic methodology and a multidimensional panel data model. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a multidimensional panel data method that includes several fixed effects. The dependent variable is a multifaceted construct that measures the participants’ intention to vote. The independent variables are electronic word of mouth (eWOM), customisation (CUS), entertainment (ENT), interaction (INT), trendiness (TRD), candidate’s perceived image (CPI), religious beliefs (RB), gender and age. The grouping variables that signify fixed effects are employment status, level of education, mostly used social media and religion. First, the significance of said fixed effects was tested through an ANOVA process. Then, the main model was estimated, including the significant grouping variables as fixed effects. Findings: Employment status and level of education were significant fixed effects. Also, eWOM, ENT, INT, CPI, RB and gender significantly affected participants’ voting intention. Research limitations/implications: Being based on a questionnaire that asked participants about how they perceive different aspects of social media, the present study is limited to their perceptions. Therefore, further studies covering the voters’ behaviour in action could be efficient complements to the present study. Practical implications: The findings could guide the political parties into prioritizing the aspects of social media in forming an effective campaign resulting in being elected. Social implications: The findings have the potential to help the public in making better informed decisions when voting. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate applications for social media which are beyond leisure time fillers. Originality/value: Fuzzy logic and multidimensional panel data estimates are this study’s novelty and originality. Structural equation modelling and crisp linguistic values have been used in previous studies on social media’s effect on voting intent. The former refines the data gathered from a questionnaire, and the latter considers the possibility of including different grouping factors to achieve a more efficient and less biased estimation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Moslehpour M.; Tiwari A.K.; Ebrahimi Pourfaez S.,Tactical,10.1108/IJOEM-08-2022-1250,Multidimensional panel data; Political marketing; Public choice; Social media marketing; Voting intention,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on the effects of social media marketing on voting intention, which translates strategic goals into specific targets and structured decisions regarding campaign strategies and voter engagement.",scopus-fuzzy logic,15,65,The effect of social media marketing on voting intention; an application of multidimensional panel data,2024
"During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.",Ayaǧ Z.; Özdemir R.G.,Tactical,10.1080/00207540600724849,Analytic network process; Enterprise resource planning; Fuzzy logic; Multiple-criteria decision-making; Software selection,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the selection of ERP software using a fuzzy analytic network process, which involves structured decision-making and evaluation of alternatives based on multiple criteria.

"This paper presents a multi-echelon distribution network design problem with pricing strategy in a stochastic environment, where location, inventory, and pricing decisions in retail and wholesale channels are made simultaneously. The considered network is comprised of a central warehouse, a set of distribution centers, and a set of retailers and wholesalers. The objective of the problem is to maximize the supply chain profit. The decisions include the location of distribution centers and the allocation of retailers and wholesalers to them, order-size for each distribution center and product price at retail and wholesale channels for different payment conditions. A mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model was formulated and solved using the Lagrangian relaxation method and a Genetic algorithm. Computational results indicate that Lagrangian relaxation algorithm has good performance in terms of objective function value and runtime, even in large sized problems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Nasiri G.R.; Deymeh H.; Karimi B.; Miandoabchi E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102646,Competitive retailing; Distribution network design; Dual-channel distribution planning; Fast-moving consumer goods; Inventory management; Lagrangian relaxation; Pricing policy,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses decision-making related to pricing, location, and inventory in a distribution network, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-genetic algorithm,20,60,Incorporating sales and marketing considerations into a competitive multi-echelon distribution network design problem with pricing strategy in a stochastic environment,2021
"Advertising has always been considered a key part of marketing strategy and played a prominent role in the success or failure of products. This paper investigates a multi-product and multi-period advertising budget allocation, determining the amount of advertising budget for each product through the time horizon. Imperative factors including life cycle stage, BCG matrix class, competitors’ reactions, and budget constraints affect the joint chain of decisions for all products to maximize the total profits. To do so, we define a stochastic sequential resource allocation problem and use an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to alleviate the huge size of the problem and multi-dimensional uncertainties of the environment. These uncertainties are the reactions of competitors based on the current status of the market and our decisions, as well as the stochastic effectiveness (rewards) of the taken action. We apply an approximate value iteration (AV I) algorithm on a numerical example and compare the results with four different policies to highlight our managerial contributions. In the end, the validity of our proposed approach is assessed against a genetic algorithm. To do so, we simplify the environment by fixing the competitor’s reaction and considering a deterministic environment. © 2022,Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization.

"Bus exterior advertising provides a powerful way to establish brand awareness because it can reach a mass of audiences with a high frequency. For a certain advertisement category, advertising effectiveness is largely dependent upon its exposure times to the target audience who takes interest in advertisement, which is termed targeted advertising. Given that the distribution of target audiences over a city varies among different advertisement categories, a practical way of enhancing overall advertising effectiveness is to deploy a bus with certain advertisement category to the bus line that best fits its target area. This gives rise to a decision-making problem of targeted bus exterior advertising and bus scheduling. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a biobjective optimization model with objectives of maximizing the quantified advertising effectiveness and minimizing the number of bus fleet size to cover all trips. The advertising effectiveness is quantified using audience demographic data. The deadheading of buses is also enabled in the scheduling process to facilitate both objectives. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-Large Neighborhood Search (NSGA-II-LNS) algorithm is developed to solve the biobjective problem with the incorporation of large neighborhood search operators into the framework of the NSGA-II to improve solution quality. Various experiments were set up to verify the proposed model and solution algorithm.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Hu Z.; Huang D.; Wang S.,Tactical,10.1061/JTEPBS.TEENG-7812,Biobjective optimization; Bus deadheading; Bus scheduling; Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-Large Neighborhood Search (NSGA-II-LNS); Targeted bus exterior advertising,5.0,,15,0,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),"The abstract discusses a decision-making problem related to optimizing bus advertising effectiveness and scheduling, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into more structured targets and decisions.",scopus-genetic algorithm,10,70,Joint Optimization of Bus Scheduling and Targeted Bus Exterior Advertising,2023
"This study presents a multi-item inventory and pricing model by considering marketing, service activities, trade credit, carbon emissions, and the restrictions of production cost and storage space. In the proposed model, shortages are allowed and demand rate is a power function of service and marketing costs, and selling price. The main objective of this study is to optimize retailer’s payments time, service and marketing expenditure, and replenishment decisions in order to maximize retailer’s total profit and minimize carbon emissions, simultaneously. Model is developed in a fuzzy environment under carbon tax regulation when the length of credit period provided by supplier is less than or equal to the length of time in which no shortage happens. To solve the proposed model, we first transform the original problem into a multi-objective Signomial Geometric Programming (SGP) problem using fuzzy and hybrid parameters, which minimizes both the mean value and the total dispersion value of the objective function. Then a global optimization problem method has been used to solve the SGP problem. Efficiency of this algorithm is tested and compared with multi-objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective genetic algorithm with varying population, and hybrid heuristic algorithm. At the end, several numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are performed to demonstrate the application of the proposed model and solution procedure to obtain managerial insights. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Jabbarzadeh A.; Aliabadi L.; Yazdanparast R.,Tactical,10.1007/s12351-019-00457-5,Carbon emissions; Delayed payments; Inventory model; Optimal payment time; Signomial geometric programming,5.0,,10,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The study focuses on optimizing specific decisions related to inventory management, pricing, marketing expenditures, and replenishment strategies, which align with tactical level decision-making.",scopus-genetic algorithm,15,70,Optimal payment time and replenishment decisions for retailer’s inventory system under trade credit and carbon emission constraints,2021
"The vending machine has become one of the non-store marketing channels to generate sales and give consumers convenient services. However, the logistics decisions in the vending machine service industry are challenging, coupled with complex constraints, considering the machine deployment location, product selection, shelf display allocation, and the elasticity of demands and spaces. This paper presents a bi-layer optimization model addressing the challenges associated with deployment location, product selection, and shelf display for a vending machine system consisting of more than ten thousand vending machines. The upper layer model selects appropriate locations for machine deployment, while the lower layer model considers product selection and shelf display in individual machines. Due to the high complexity of the problem, metaheuristic approaches are developed for seeking near-optimal solutions. The proposed model and algorithms are evaluated using various scales of problems, demonstrating their effectiveness in delivering premium logistics and operational solutions. Additionally, the study explores the impact of product cross and space elasticities. The proposed two-level genetic algorithm consistently performs better than Tabu search and Particle swarm optimization in small-scale and large-scale cases. The proposed approach can significantly enhance profitability for large-scale vending machine deployment in the vending machine service industry. © 2024",Wang K.-J.; Febri N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103581,Bi-layer optimization; Elasticity; Genetic algorithm; Machine location; Product selection; Shelf display; Vending machine,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses a bi-layer optimization model for the logistics decisions in the vending machine service industry, focusing on specific targets like machine deployment location, product selection, and shelf display allocation.

"This study aims to investigate the role of social media on consumer behaviour in the restaurants industry of Bahrain. The objectives of this research were to assess importance of social media as a marketing tool for Bahrain's restaurants for influencing consumer purchase decision-making. Such an objective was reached by the scholars who randomly collected data from 224 respondents in Bahrain, who use social media, using a survey instrument. The findings of the descriptive analysis revealed that social media affects consumers' decision-making, such that the consumers use the social media to study new products, services, and particularly new brands. Also, ongoing consumer discussions reveal how social media exposes the pros and cons of products, services, and brands, so consumers are comfortable with their online decisions, since they can select broads before settling on what is the best price, quality, etc. Moreover, the social media speeds the spread of information unlike any other mass media; ensuring that new knowledge reaches consumers, hence enhancing competition among retailers in the restaurant industry. This study concludes that social media plays a vital role in promoting consumer welfare and decision-making. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co.",Alshaer D.S.; Hamdan A.; Razzaque A.,Tactical,10.1142/S0219649220400122,consumer behaviour; Kingdom of Bahrain; Social Internet of Things; social media,5.0,,15,0,World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Auction-based incentive mechanisms can satisfy the heterogeneous demands of both Demand Side Platforms (DSP) and Supply Side Platforms (SSP) in Internet of Things (IoT) marketing. However, DSP platforms often need help with two issues during the auction process: low enthusiasm and unreasonable bidding. To address these problems, we use the second-price sealed auction and propose a framework for multi-round real-time bidding with game machine learning. We introduce a multi-round advertising bidding mechanism incorporating reputation incentive rules to enhance DSP enthusiasm. The aim is to stimulate DSP participation and deter malicious DSP behavior, ensuring fairness and transparency in the bidding process. Subsequently, we design an auction screening model and adopt a multi-round auction format to ensure that only capable and willing advertising demand partners can participate, thus guaranteeing the reasonableness of DSP bids. Furthermore, we design a real-time bidding mechanism to adapt to the dynamic nature of the IoT marketing market. This mechanism transforms the problem of maximizing DSP revenue under budget constraints into a parameter adjustment problem based on a Markov Decision Process. We then utilize the Double Deep Q Network method to obtain the optimal bidding strategy for DSPs. Ultimately, the results demonstrate that our framework improves the final transaction price by 14.71%, increases the expected click-through rate by an average of 19.35%, and reduces the average cost per thousand impressions by 20.34%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang R.; Jiang C.; Zhang J.; Fan J.; Ren J.; Xia H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.iot.2023.100921,Deep reinforcement learning; IoT marketing; Multi-round auctions; Real-time bidding,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a specific mechanism for improving real-time bidding strategies in IoT marketing, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at translating strategic goals into actionable targets.

"In recent years, global digitalization has developed rapidly. Driven by the gradual maturity of various technologies, the popularization of Internet and mobile devices, the Internet of Things and cloud computing services, the growth of various data has greatly increased and diversified data. The value of these data can be used to predict consumer behavior, differentiate user groups, develop effective marketing strategies, and create differentiated competitiveness. To predict consumer behavior in purchasing insurance products, this study collected 4,474 insurance transactions from a bank in Tainan, Taiwan. After data preprocessing, the number of available transactions is 3,430. In these organized transactions, we use the classification of the insurance product as the dependent variable and the features of the customer as the independent variable. Then, correlation analysis was performed by chi-square test, and uncorrelated factors were analyzed. Analyze influencing factors through a decision tree machine learning model. According to the analysis results of the decision tree model, the accuracy rate is almost 70%, and the most important influencing factors are the actual insurance fee and currency.

"Clusters are groups of activities consisting of core industries, related industries, supporting industries, and supporting and related economic activities, which are interrelated and mutually supportive. This study aims to cluster micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Garut Regency based on their similarity of attributes attached to the factors. These aspects include a taxpayer identification ownership, business license ownership, total net worth, total capital, number of employees, total business volume, product certification, product license, and brand. Clusterization has an important urgency for the development of MSMEs. Clustering can help group MSMEs into groups that are easier to analyze and make the right decisions to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of MSMEs. In addition, the application of clustering for MSMEs can have positive implications such as identifying the characteristics of MSMEs, developing appropriate marketing strategies, improving product or service quality, collaboration and information exchange, and access to resources. This can help MSMEs to increase their efficiency and competitiveness in the market. After data screening, the sample of MSMEs was analyzed using K-means clustering analysis and the help of RapidMiner 5.3 software. There were six iterations conducted before the data position value was stable, with the results revealing three MSME clusters. Cluster 2 had the highest percentage of MSMEs, with 84%. Cluster 1 had a higher percentage of MSMEs with ownership of business license numbers than Clusters 2 and 3. Cluster 3 had a larger and more significant number of MSMEs and a larger total net worth and ownership of product and brand licenses than the other clusters, while Cluster 2 showed an intermediate profile in almost all factors.

"Purpose – The aim of this research is to explore how and why different migrant groups see different values in places they move to. Understanding these values and also the conditions in which these values are shaped will help in targeting marketing effort. Design/methodology/approach – The hierarchical and K/means cluster analyses were instrumental in identifying different migrant clusters. Planned contrasts were employed to compare related pairs of clusters. The logistic regression analysis identified several determinants of cluster membership likelihood. Findings – Four different internal migrant clusters are identified in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. These are Material Success Seekers, Community/Environment Folks, Apathetics, and All/rounders. The former two express a fragmentalist lifestyle. Material Success Seekers emphasise regional business opportunities while being indifferent to social and natural resources. In contrast, Community/Environment Folks emphasise social and natural resources while maintaining indifference to business opportunities. In turn, the latter two clusters make up a holistic lifestyle: All/rounders consider all three major characteristics of the region to be important while apathetics totally deemphasise these characteristics. The planned contrasts show that demographics are instrumental in predicting differences between related clusters but not helpful in distinguishing the identified lifestyles. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this investigation is that the important constructs used to cluster migrants are not well calibrated, although the reliability scores appear to be satisfactory. Moreover, the use of four/point importance scales does not allow attaining a greater level of construct sensitivity. The research method is unique in a sense that the cluster analysis and the planned contrasts are applied to examine contrasting values of migrant collectivities. Practical implications – A number of specific practical challenges need to be resolved by the regional decision makers in order to enhance place satisfaction by internal migrant collectivities. First, the regional and city councils will need to tailor different services, facilities, and public spaces to appeal to different requirements of migrant clusters. Second, the region's settlement support agency should provide migrants with relevant, focused, and differentiated information about available services and resources to suit their various life goals, aspirations, and values. Originality/value – This investigation tackles the problem of lacking theoretical and empirical research foundation on internal migration as a marketing phenomenon.

"This study used a marketing-research paradigm to explore gamblers’ attraction to EGMs based on different elements of the environment. A select set of environmental features was sourced from a prior study (Thorne et al. in J Gambl Issues 2016b), and a discrete choice experiment was conducted through an online survey. Using the same dataset first described by Rockloff et al. (EGM Environments that contribute to excess consumption and harm, 2015), a sample of 245 EGM gamblers were sourced from clubs in Victoria, Australia, and 7516 gamblers from an Australian national online survey-panel. Participants’ choices amongst sets of hypothetical gambling environments allowed for an estimation of the implied individual-level utilities for each feature (e.g., general sounds, location, etc.). K-means clustering on these utilities identified four unique market segments for EGM gambling, representing four different types of consumers. The segments were named according to their dominant features: Social, Value, High Roller and Internet. We found that the environments orientated towards the Social and Value segments were most conducive to attracting players with relatively few gambling problems, while the High Roller and Internet-focused environments had greater appeal for players with problems and vulnerabilities.

"Purpose – The aim of this paper is to explore consumer decision-making styles when buying digital products, and to identify different clusters of consumers based on their approaches in choosing digital products. The literature regarding consumer decision-making styles when purchasing digital products is rather scarce. Therefore, a research study on behavioral patterns and product attri-butes important to consumers when they purchase digital goods might contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this type of consumer behavior while also broadening the existing body of knowledge. Design/Methodology/Approach – Empirical data were collected using an online questionnaire consist-ing of items borrowed from the relevant literature and adapted to the research context. Research results are presented using descriptive statistics, exploratory fac-tor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and k-means cluster analysis. Findings and implications – This study has revealed four distinct consumer groups that differ in their consumer decision-making styles when buying digital products. Both theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings are discussed. Results of this research serve as helpful insights into consumer behavior characteristics in a digital products market, providing digital goods companies with valuable inputs for planning their marketing strategies and activities. Limitations – The results of the present research apply to digital products in general. Future research should develop and confirm these initial findings further by incorporating specific digital product categories and fo-cusing on other socio-cultural contexts.

"Market decisions are complex because they involve many data and related criteria in geographic space with different intensities. Geographic information systems (GIS) provide solutions that allow the understanding and understanding of market problems (Geomarketing) and help the decision-making process by allowing the treatment and geographical analysis of these data and criteria. However, GIS involves resources such as people, equipment and maintenance which are not always available. Web-based GIS (WebGIS) can offer the same GIS solutions but require less resources. However, studies show that WebGIS has not been used to its full potential, limited to the geovisualization of points of interest. We propose a Geomarketing WebGIS to solve a classic problem of geographic-market decision. Operated by a two-stage method and spatial analysis (k-means, Voronoi diagram, weighted midpoint, and kernel density function), Geomarketing WebGIS uses potential customer data to show a set of store-branches and the parent-store location. Through simulation, we show that the Geomarketing WebGIS can go beyond the geovisualization and offer solution to a relevant problem of the literature without the restrictions found in the GIS. These findings help to reaffirm that WebGIS: i) has the potential to solve complex geographic problems; ii) have features and resources such as GIS but maintained and operated with fewer resources; and iii) favor the geographic thinking. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Practical implications: The results provide valuable guidance and a pragmatic approach for those hotel managers that aim to generate tailored marketing strategies for guest segments that are interested in GRTs. Originality/value: This study concentrates on GRTs with a market segmentation approach by using advanced statistical procedures. It contributes to the body of related research literature by offering empirical evidence where the study evaluates the impact of the availability of new GRTs on guest decision-making based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior. Practitioners will be able to use the presented findings to generate marketing and pricing strategies with respect to the technological needs and wants of each typology. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Erdem M.; Atadil H.A.; Nasoz P.,Tactical,10.1108/JHTT-06-2018-0046,Decision making; Guest-room technology; Hotel technology; In-room technology; Market segmentation; Willingness to pay,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on analyzing hotel guests' attitudes toward guest room technologies (GRTs) and provides practical implications for hotel managers to create tailored marketing strategies based on guest typologies, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-k-means,10,70,Leveraging guest-room technology: a tale of two guest profiles,2019
"Commodity marketing managers are demanding an increasingly detailed description of their customers in order to make more efficient use of their marketing budgets. This study uses a purchase-occasion, household panel data set to investigate consumers’ discrete choice among varieties of apples and their continuous decision of how much to buy. We segment households based on their elasticities of response to several marketing variables: price, promotion, and advertising using a k-means clustering algorithm.

"Purpose: This study aims to explore the opposite effects of single-category versus multi-category products information diversity on consumer decision making. Further, the authors investigate the moderating role of three categories of visitors – direct, hesitant and hedonic – in the relationship between product information diversity and consumer decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilizes a sample of 1,101,062 product click streams from 4,200 consumers. Visitors are clustered using the k-means algorithm. The diversity of information recommendations for single and multi-category products is characterized using granularity and dispersion, respectively. Empirical analysis is conducted to examine their influence on the two-stage decision-making process of heterogeneous online visitors. Findings: The study reveals that the impact of recommended information diversity on consumer decision making differs significantly between single-category and multiple-category products. Specifically, information diversity in single-category products enhances consumers' click and purchase intention, while information diversity in multiple-category products reduces consumers' click and purchase intention. Moreover, based on the analysis of online visiting heterogeneity, hesitant, direct and hedonic features enhance the positive impact of granularity on consumer decision making; while direct features exacerbate the negative impact of dispersion on consumer decision making. Originality/value: First, the article provides support for studies related to information cocoon. Second, the research contributes evidence to support the information overload theory.

"The media and consumer research groups have been keeping the Millennials in spotlight for many years now; perhaps it is time to turn some of the attention on Gen Z, which began its foray into mainstream consumption. This exploratory study examines the shopping orientation of Gen Z online shoppers using the generational cohort theory (GCT) as a framework and provides insights to e-retailers to understand how this generation approaches the online shopping. The penetration of Internet and accelerated growth of online shopping have enthused the e-retailers to offer a wide range of goods at greater efficiency than the traditional players. By cluster analysis (K-means) of nine online shopping orientation factors (two were eliminated prior due to low factor loading scores), four segments were identified: (a) ‘Economic-quality seekers’, (b) ‘Convenience shoppers’, (c) ‘Deal hunting-convenience seekers’ and (d) ‘Brand and quality conscious shoppers’, and the study profiled each segment based on the demographic data through chi-square analysis.

"Clustering observations into groups is perhaps one of the more common marketing analytic techniques. Many variable-selection procedures are available for clustering, and some have exhibited good performance in simulation studies. Unfortunately, the best-performing methods often fail because they emphasize the clustering power of individual variables. For this reason, we recommend extreme caution when using the existing procedures, and we argue that enumeration of all-possible variable subsets is a preferred strategy. We also address a common decision problem—the selection of the number of clusters—and develop an index which can help guide the joint selection of variables and clusters. By way of an empirical example, we illustrate the variable-selection problem and demonstrate the use of the proposed index to jointly select variables and clusters in K-means partitioning. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",Brudvig S.; Brusco M.J.; Cradit J.D.,Tactical,10.1057/s41270-018-0045-7,K-means clustering; New product launch; Pharmaceutical industry; Segmentation; Variable selection,5.0,,15,0,Palgrave Macmillan,"The abstract discusses clustering techniques and variable selection for marketing analytics, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-k-means,10,70,Joint selection of variables and clusters: recovering the underlying structure of marketing data,2019
"Determining the distribution fitting of traditional private vehicle user driving behavior is an effective way to understand the differences between different users and provides valuable information on user travel demands. The classification of users is significant to product improvement, precision marketing, and driving recommendations. This study proposed a method which includes four aspects: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing; (3) data analysis—a two-stage hybrid user classification, and (4) distribution fitting method. A two-stage hybrid user classification method is used to cluster traditional vehicle users. First, the first-stage classification of the classification method extracts the daily typical time–mileage-series travel patterns (TMTP) to obtain user driving time characteristics. This first-stage classification also extracts the mean and standard deviation of the daily vehicle mileage traveled (DVMT) to express user driving demands. Next, users are divided by K-means based on the driving time characteristics and driving demands from the first stage. Finally, a three-parameter log-normal distribution is used to fit the DVMT of different user types. Comparison with traditional clustering based on the mean and standard deviation and the proportion of each vehicle’s time series in the TMTP types, this study reveals that the new methods provide significant advantages in analyzing driving behavior and high reference value for enterprises making electric vehicle driving range recommendations, car market segmentation, and policy making decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the organisational readiness of small and medium scaled hotels to serve indigenous local cuisines and to segment the hotel properties for gastronomic tourism campaigning and destination marketing aims. The study also explores how the concept of organisational readiness relates to menu decision makers’ intentions, perceived benefits and organisational characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Organisational readiness was measured by three dimensions (culture, climate and capacity). Data were derived from a survey of primary menu decision makers from 187 hotels in Ghana. Using a combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical (K-means) algorithms, the hotels were clustered into homogenous groups based on the original raw scores of hotel readiness indicators. The resultant cluster solution was then validated and profiled against relevant external variables. Findings: Analyses reveal three clusters which distinguish hotels by the degree of readiness to serve indigenous local dishes. The resultant segments differ by hotel category (star rating) as well as by the job positions and perceptions of primary menu decision makers. Unexpectedly, lower class hotels displayed significantly greater levels of organisational readiness to serve indigenous cuisines than those in the higher class category. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates that organisational readiness is related to perceived benefits and intentions. Among others, the findings advance the understanding of organisational readiness in hotels in the context of menu decision-making. Given the need to embed new practices in a fast-changing hospitality environment, insights drawn could also serve as a basis for future research. Generalisability of empirical findings may be limited by the socio-economic context as well as the study’s focus on small and medium scaled hotels. Practical implications: This paper supports hotel businesses in understanding the concept of organisational readiness and its relation to organisational characteristics and menu decision-making. By highlighting the different clusters of hotels, the findings accentuate the need for destination marketers and gastronomic tourism campaigners to target higher classed hotels and draw attention to the potential benefits of serving indigenous cuisines while addressing latent concerns. The results further underscore the role of organisational culture and the necessity for such campaign activities to be directed towards those with ample influence within the hierarchical structures of hotels. Originality/value: This is an initial attempt to examine the application of the organisational readiness concept to menu decision-making in hotels and to explore the implications for segmentation purposes. Further analysis revealed the critical role of organisational culture on menu decision-making patterns.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to determine redesigned product profiles to maximize Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction of Turkish consumers under an ordinal utility approach. Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained from a survey conducted in Erzurum in 2014. A conjoint analysis was used to determine the utilities of each level along with the relative importance of Erzurum Civil cheese attributes for measuring the consumption satisfaction as an indicator of the purchase decision and priorities of Turkish consumers. Findings – The results of the study clearly highlighted that Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction was maximized with the augmented and actual product images redesigned by a private-labelled and local-branded simple product with the highest and medium prices based on organic production techniques for heavy and light consumers, respectively. However, medium consumers appreciated the core benefit obtained from the credence quality attributes supported by the generic branded simple cheese with the lowest price purchased directly from the farmstead villages. Eventually, these marketing tactics and strategies could increase demand, maximizing the cheese consumption and satisfaction of Turkish consumers in each cluster. They could also provide greater consumption satisfaction to Turkish consumers as well as bigger marginal contributions to the market dynamics of the food supply chain.

"Purpose - Marketing communication practitioners in higher education have not yet identified specific subgroups with similar characteristics within the prospective student (target) market, and do not always know which preferred sources learners consult when deciding on a tertiary institution for further or higher education. In addition, little is known about prospective students' information needs when deciding which institution to attend. As a result many tertiary institutions still use one message in one medium for all target markets. The aims of this paper are: to determine if sub-groups exist within the student recruitment market that need tailor made persuasive messages; to determine the preferred sources of information gathering for prospective students that influences their choice of tertiary institution; and to determine the information needs of prospective students that influence their decisions to select an institution of higher education. Design/methodology/approach - A stratified random sample of 19 schools was drawn, from which a total of 716 successfully completed questionnaires were used to conduct factor and cluster analyses to determine information needs and source preferences of these respondents. Findings - Ten factors under the VARCLUS procedure with high eigen values were grouped together with the following labels: university, college, employability aspects, course content, student experience, sporting aspects, financial aspects, direct sources, media sources and social sources. Five sub-groups clustered together with the K-means analysis, labelled: have lots, aspiring have lots, little direction and new lifers. Research limitations/implications - A limited amount of literature is available on the current use of media and sources by the target market. Decisions on the choice of a tertiary institution for higher education are most probably influenced by socio-economic circumstances in a developing context, like South Africa. Practical implications - An integrated and well co-ordinated media and message strategy for each of the various sub-groups should be specified for an IMC plan to be successful.

"Psychographic segmentation has found higher merit among marketing scholars and practicing managers in designing effective marketing strategies to target and deliver better—especially for indulgence food such as chocolates. Hence, adopting a mixed method approach, 17 attitudinal statements were generated through focus group discussions and were used to segment a sample of 301 urban chocolate consumers. The survey data was subjected to a K-means cluster analysis, and it revealed the existence of three distinct clusters: the innovative national; the conservative patriot; and the global seeker. Chi-square analysis was conducted to profile the three groups. Though the study was exploratory in nature, the clusters exhibited such distinct buying patterns that the results hold tremendous value not only from an academic perspective but also for chocolate manufacturers and retailers. All three groups were buying chocolates for gifting purpose, while the young innovators liked to buy for self-gifts as well. Point of sales display had maximum impact on their purchase decision. The global seeker was buying more foreign brands versus the other two, who bought chocolate brands of national origin. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",Sondhi N.; Chawla D.,Tactical,10.1080/10454446.2017.1244784,adult consumers; Chocolate consumption; cluster analysis; emerging markets; Segmentation,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses psychographic segmentation and the analysis of consumer behavior related to chocolate purchasing, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Segmentation is a common and important task for most marketing departments. Besides, other marketing decisions are influenced by market segmentation results. Benefit segmentation is one of the best approaches for market segmentation among others. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid benefit segmentation approach which applied two-stage clustering, conjoint analysis, and Delphi technique to segment customers according to their benefits. More precisely, we used two-stage clustering based on main benefits derived from conjoint analysis to classify customers into different segments. Conjoint analysis was used to assess and balance dissimilar aspects of consumers needs. Delphi method was used for the selection of the most important criteria and their levels which conjoint analysis required all of them for evaluation. This approach did not only help managers to segment customers but also to provide a way to analyse consumer behaviour, determine the marking strategy and extract the importance of each attribute in each segment. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Aghdaie M.H.; Tafreshi P.F.; Behzadian M.,Tactical,10.1504/IJBIR.2014.059532,Benefit segmentation; Conjoint analysis; Delphi method; Iran; K-means clustering; Laptop market; Market segmentation; Two-stage clustering; Wards method,5.0,,15,0,Inderscience Publishers,"The abstract describes a hybrid benefit segmentation approach that involves structured decision-making processes like clustering and conjoint analysis, aimed at addressing specific marketing targets such as customer segmentation and behavior analysis.

"Category management (CM) plays an increasingly important role in retailing management, as it aids retailers to increase their core competitiveness, maximise profits and ensure a good long-term customer relationship. This technique has been successfully applied to diverse large manufacturers and wholesale retailers. However, it remains a challenging task to directly employ the CM technique in convenience store (CVS) chain(s). This is because CVS chains are often distributed in a variety of areas, each store has impulsive consumers, and the traditional market segmentation attributes (e.g. consumer age, salary, and background) are difficult to collect under such circumstances. This makes it impractical to apply one general CM solution to all CVS chains. Hence, it is crucial to segment a market region and then apply customised CM solutions to the corresponding segments. This paper presents an innovative market segmentation model which is driven by category-role (CR), for the first time, to support CM in CVS chains. A new similarity measure (named HCsim()) and an improved weighted fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm (WFKM) are developed in an effort to cluster the CVSs. The usefulness and applicability of this study is illustrated by means of an empirical study to provide marketing strategy decision support. The derived results are also discussed and compared with existing methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Han S.; Ye Y.; Fu X.; Chen Z.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2013.09.017,Category management; Convenience store chain management; Market segmentation; Strategic decision support,0.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a customized category management solution for convenience store chains, emphasizing the segmentation of market regions and the application of specific marketing strategies.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new RFM model called length, recency, frequency, monetary and periodicity (LRFMP) for classifying customers in the grocery retail industry; and to identify different customer segments in this industry based on the proposed model. Design/methodology/approach: This study combines the LRFMP model and clustering for customer segmentation. Real-life data from a grocery chain operating in Turkey is used. Three cluster validation indices are used for optimizing the number of groups of customers and K-means algorithm is employed to cluster customers. First, attributes of the LRFMP model are extracted for each customer, and then based on LRFMP model features, customers are segmented into different customer groups. Finally, identified customer segments are profiled based on LRFMP characteristics and for each customer profile, unique CRM and marketing strategies are recommended. Findings: The results show that there are five different customer groups and based on LRFMP characteristics, they are profiled as: “high-contribution loyal customers,” “low-contribution loyal customers,” “uncertain customers,” “high-spending lost customers” and “low-spending lost customers.” Practical implications: This research may provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic guideline for effectively identifying different customer profiles based on the LRFMP model, give grocery companies useful insights about different customer profiles, and assist decision makers in developing effective customer relationships and unique marketing strategies, and further allocating resources efficiently. Originality/value: This study contributes to prior literature by proposing a new RFM model, called LRFMP for the customer segmentation and providing useful insights about behaviors of different customer types in the Turkish grocery industry.

Brand equity measurement is the premise and basis for enterprises to formulate brand strategies and to plan marketing activities. The difficulty of measuring brand equity has been a problem that has plagued the industry for many years and needs to be solved due to the many models miscellaneous methods difficulties in unification and insensitivity of brand equity measurement. Brand equity measurement can be operated from finance market and consumer perspectives while marketers often measure brand equity from a consumer perspective as they focus on brand communication and sales issues. Traditional approaches for brand equity measurement mainly utilize consumer surveys a major limitation of which is that the respondents are highly susceptible to the influence of research instruments such as survey design and intention of the researchers. Additionally survey respondents may be unable or unwilling to express the actual hidden opinions. Traditional approaches are also limited for low efficiency in data collection which leads to delayed reporting high cost and insensitive results and therefore they may be difficult to provide timely information for marketing decisions. With the diffusion of social media consumers are provided with a greater ability to express their opinions freely on social networks. Clothing consumers in particular appear highly active on social media largely because clothing products can provide a lot of worthy topics for social conversations. In this background social listening which monitors naturally occurring brand-related consumer conversations on social networks provides an alternative data source for brand equity measurement for clothing brands. To address the problems of slow response time high cost and insensitive results of traditional brand equity measurement methods the research proposes and validates a method of measuring apparel brand equity based on social listening data by taking into account the characteristics of apparel brands. The proposed method applied consumer-based brand equity framework to social listening data which was obtained with web crawling technologies. The research first developed a framework of seven dimensions of brand benefits for clothing brands based on Keller's brand equity theory which involves brand benefits association in brand image. The seven dimensions include expertise quality aesthetics entertainment social identity fashionability and individuality. The research utilized Sina Weibo as the source of social listening data and selected brand N a leading international sports wear brand as the case to illustrate the proposed approach. Using a web crawling technology the research obtained a total of 54 360 consumer conversations of this brand on Sina Weibo for the year of 2021 involving 5 032 samples and 49 328 pieces of full data. Next the research used the keyword extraction algorithm of LDA topic model to process and purify the unstructured social listening data to establish a thesaurus for the brand benefit dimensions. The research repetitively performed the LDA algorithm four times using samples of the full data to ensure the thesaurus was complete and 1 600 pieces of data were extracted. The study concluded that the re-emergence of new words had an impact of less than 1. 41% on the brand interest keyword lexicon indicating that the lexicon was largely saturated. The resulting thesaurus included 28 keywords for the expertise dimension 12 for quality 17 for aesthetics 21 for entertainment 24 for social identity 14 for fashionability and 14 for individuality. Lastly the TF-IDF text similarity algorithm was used to calculate the similarity between the thesaurus of each dimension and the full data of social conversations to achieve the measurement of brand equity for the case brand. Innovation in this research are three folds. First the research designed and validated a new approach to measure clothing brand equity which may overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. Second it established a set of indicators of clothing brand equity which can be used for future research. Third it provided a solution to processing unstructured data in natural languages. The results showed that in 2021 consumers were highly concerned of social identity of the case brand its brand equity was influenced by the Xinjiang Cotton event which created tremendous number of conversations about the brand on social networks. In conclusion brand benefits in brand equity which marketers are highly concerned of can be extracted from social listening data. The proposed approach based on social listening data which are often dynamic may overcome the limitations of traditional methods in cost efficiency granularity and measurement sensitivity. In terms of methodology the keyword extraction algorithms such as LDA can be used to construct thesaurus of brand benefit dimensions and text-similarity algorithms can be used to provide quantitative assessment for the dimensions of brand equity. Previous research has shown that carefully planned efforts in enhancing brand equity can significantly improve marketing effectiveness. Emphasizing brand benefits during online shopping festivals or promotional events for instance can create greater consumer engagement with a brand enhance brand image in the minds of consumers and consequently improve consumers' willingness to buy. In future research the algorithms of the proposed approach can be further optimized by applying more cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

"Purpose: Two valuable pieces of information – reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings – are accessible to potential customers before they make a purchasing decision. An extensive body of marketing literature has scrutinized the influence of customers’ reviews by linking such aspects as the volume and valance of reviews with product sales and customers’ purchase intention. The aim of this study, for which dual coding theory was used, was to understand the relationship between reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the latent Dirichlet allocation technique to categorize customers’ reviews. The present findings contribute to the literature by showing the underlying mechanisms that customers use to interpret reviews and associate them with numerical ratings. Findings: The gradient boosted decision tree model demonstrates that non-abstract-dominant reviews (reviews mainly consist of tangible objects, actions, events or affective words) are significant predictors of their corresponding numerical ratings. However, abstract-dominant reviews (i.e. those consisting primarily of intangible objects, events or actions) cannot predict their associated numerical ratings.

"In this study, we aim to investigate the influence of the time spent reading product information on consumer behavior in e-commerce. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing importance of understanding online consumer behavior, our research focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of customer navigation on e-commerce websites and its effects on purchasing decisions. Recognizing the multidimensional and dynamic nature of consumer behavior, we utilize machine learning techniques, which offer the capacity to handle complex data structures and reveal hidden patterns within the data, thereby augmenting our comprehension of underlying consumer behavior mechanisms. By analyzing clickstream data using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we provide new insights into the internal structure of customer clusters and propose a methodology for analyzing non-linear relationships in datasets. Our results reveal that the time spent reading product-related information, combined with other factors such as bounce rates, exit rates, and customer type, significantly influences a customer’s purchasing decision.

"Purpose: This is the first article to apply a machine learning approach to the analysis of time on market on real estate markets. Design/methodology/approach: The random survival forest approach is introduced to the real estate market. The most important predictors of time on market are revealed and it is analyzed how the survival probability of residential rental apartments responds to these major characteristics. Findings: Results show that price, living area, construction year, year of listing and the distances to the next hairdresser, bakery and city center have the greatest impact on the marketing time of residential apartments. The time on market for an apartment in Munich is lowest at a price of 750 € per month, an area of 60 m2, built in 1985 and is in a range of 200–400 meters from the important amenities. Practical implications: The findings might be interesting for private and institutional investors to derive real estate investment decisions and implications for portfolio management strategies and ultimately to minimize cash-flow failure. Originality/value: Although machine learning algorithms have been applied frequently on the real estate market for the analysis of prices, its application for examining time on market is completely novel.

"Purpose: Online reviews are regarded as a source of information for decision-making because of the abundance and ready availability of information. Whereas, the sheer volume of online reviews makes it hard for consumers, especially the older adults who perceive more difficulties in reading reviews and obtaining information compared to younger adults, to locate the useful ones. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective method to locate valuable reviews of mobile phones for older adults. Besides, the authors also want to explore what characteristics of the technology older adults prefer. This will benefit both e-retailers and e-commerce platforms. Design/methodology/approach: After collecting online reviews related to mobile phones designed for older adults from a popular Chinese e-commerce platform (JD Mall), topic modeling, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) methods were applied to extract latent topics and uncover potential dimensions that consumers frequently referred to in their reviews. According to consumers' attitudes towards different popular topics, seven machine learning models were employed to predict the usefulness and popularity of online reviews due to their excellent performance in prediction. To improve the performance, a weighted model based on the two best-performing models was built and evaluated. Findings: Based on the TF-IDF, topic modeling, and LIWC methods, the authors find that older adults are more interested in the exterior, sound, and communication functions of mobile phones. Besides, the weighted model (Random Forest: Decision Tree = 2:1) is the best model for predicting the online review popularity, while random forest performs best in predicting the perceived usefulness of online reviews. Practical implications: This study’s findings can help e-commerce platforms and merchants identify the needs of the targeted consumers, predict reviews that will get more attention, and provide some early responses to some questions. Originality/value: The results propose that older adults pay more attention to the mobile phones' exterior, sound, and communication function, guiding future research.

"In the precision marketing of a new product, it is a challenge to allocate limited resources to the target customer groups with different characteristics. We presented a framework using the distance-based algorithm, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine to capture customers’ preferences toward promotion channels. Additionally, online learning programming was combined with machine learning strategies to fit a dynamic environment, evaluating its performance through a parsimonious model of minimum regret. A resource optimization model was proposed using classification results as input. In particular, we collected data from an institution that provides financial credit products to capital-constrained small businesses. Our sample contained 525,919 customers who will be introduced to a new product. By simulating different scenarios between resources and demand, we showed an up to 22.42% increase in the number of expected borrowers when KNN was performed with an optimal resource allocation strategy. Our results also show that KNN is the most stable method to perform classification and that the distance-based algorithm has the most efficient adoption with online learning. © 2022 by the authors.

"Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon. © 2022 The Authors",Hartmann J.; Heitmann M.; Siebert C.; Schamp C.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.05.005,Deep Contextual Language Models; Machine Learning; Meta-Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Transfer Learning,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the application of sentiment analysis in marketing, focusing on method selection and performance expectations related to specific research questions and data characteristics, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,More than a Feeling: Accuracy and Application of Sentiment Analysis,2023
"The increasing importance of online distribution channels is paralleled by a rising interest in gaining insights into the customer journey and browsing behavior. We evaluate several machine learning methods (latent Dirichlet allocation, correlated topic model, structural topic model, replicated softmax model) with respect to their ability to reproduce the browsing behavior of households across websites. In addition, we compare these machine learning methods to a related classical technique, singular value decomposition. In our study, the replicated softmax model outperforms latent Dirichlet allocation, but the correlated topic model attains the overall best performance. Compared to singular value decomposition both the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model lead to a more efficient compression of web browsing data. On the other hand, singular value decomposition surpasses latent Dirichlet allocation. We interpret results of the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model by determining combinations of topics or hidden variables that are heterogeneous with respect to visited websites. We show that decision makers should not rely on bivariate measures of site visits, as these do not agree with measures of interdependences between sites that can be inferred from the correlated topic model or the replicated softmax model. We investigate how well topics or hidden variables measured by these methods predict yearly household expenditures. The correlated topic model leads to the best predictive performance, followed by the replicated softmax model. We also discuss how the replicated softmax model can be used to support online marketing decisions of websites. © 2021, The Author(s).",Falke A.; Hruschka H.,Tactical,10.1007/s11573-021-01067-4,Machine learning; Online marketing; Restricted Boltzmann machine; Topic models; Web browsing,5.0,,10,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning methods to analyze customer browsing behavior and predict household expenditures, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Recently, author profiling on social media and on online platforms, characterized by a huge volumes of data, has become more than a critical issue. This issue is of increasing interest in various fields related to forensic medicine, security, marketing, education, etc. The main objective of author profiling is to identify the type of writer of the messages, whether it is a human or a bot with a very strong presence. These bots have the task of drawing the attention of browsers to specific events, often used to disseminate incorrect and/or false information. In this work, we offer a new approach to detect these bots and the kind of anonymous perpetrators on these social networks. Our approach, purely statistical, is based on digital features (APSF), extracted from users’ tweets, and on the technique of random forests. A total of 17 stylometry-based features were used to train the model. To assess the performance of our approach, we considered different standard measures, namely accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The results obtained show that our approach gives the best performance for both English and Spanish languages. For the English dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 92.45% for the bot detection task and 90.36% for the gender classification; similarly, we obtained accuracy values of 89.68% and 88.88% for the Spanish dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Ouni S.; Fkih F.; Omri M.N.,Tactical,10.1007/s13278-021-00768-6,Bot detection; Features extraction; Gender detection; Machine learning; Twitter,5.0,,25,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses a specific approach to detect bots and anonymous perpetrators on social media, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into structured targets such as user engagement and marketing analytics.",scopus-machine learning,15,55,Toward a new approach to author profiling based on the extraction of statistical features,2021
"Algorithmic systems help manage the governance of digital platforms featuring user-generated content, including how money is distributed to creators from the profits a platform earns from advertising on this content. However, creators producing content about disadvantaged populations have reported that these kinds of systems are biased, having associated their content with prohibited or unsafe content, leading to what creators believed were error-prone decisions to demonetize their videos. Motivated by these reports, we present the results of 20 interviews with YouTube creators and a content analysis of videos, tweets, and news about demonetization cases to understand YouTubers' perceptions of demonetization affecting videos featuring disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, as well as creator responses to demonetization, and what kinds of tools and infrastructure support they desired. We found creators had concerns about YouTube's algorithmic system stereotyping content featuring vulnerable demographics in harmful ways, for example by labeling it ""unsafe'' for children or families - creators believed these demonetization errors led to a range of economic, social, and personal harms. To provide more context to these findings, we analyzed and report on the technique a few creators used to audit YouTube's algorithms to learn what could cause the demonetization of videos featuring LGBTQ people, culture and/or social issues. In response to the varying beliefs about the causes and harms of demonetization errors, we found our interviewees wanted more reliable information and statistics about demonetization cases and errors, more control over their content and advertising, and better economic security.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",Kingsley S.; Sinha P.; Wang C.; Eslami M.; Hong J.I.,Tactical,10.1145/3555149,algorithm auditing; algorithmic systems; algorithms; bias; content creators; creative economy; demonetization; discrimination; economic opportunity; fair pay; future of work; LGBTQ; machine learning systems.; marginalized communities; monetization; precarious work; user auditing; YouTube,5.0,,20,5,Association for Computing Machinery,"The abstract discusses YouTube creators' perceptions and responses to demonetization, highlighting specific desires for better tools and infrastructure, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.

"An overwhelming majority of previous works find longer product reviews to be more helpful than short reviews. In this paper, we build upon information overload theory and propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the complexity of the line of argumentation. To test this idea, we implement state-of-the-art machine learning methods that allow us to study the line of argumentation in reviews at the sentence-level. Our empirical analysis based on a dataset of Amazon customer reviews suggests that line of argumentation and review length are closely intertwined such that longer reviews with frequent changes between positive and negative arguments are perceived as less helpful.

"Modern call centers require precise forecasts of call and e-mail arrivals to optimize staffing decisions and to ensure high customer satisfaction through short waiting times and the availability of qualified agents. In the dynamic environment of multi-channel customer contact, organizational decision-makers often rely on robust but simplistic forecasting methods. Although forecasting literature indicates that incorporating additional information into time series predictions adds value by improving model performance, extant research in the call center domain barely considers the potential of sophisticated multivariate models. Hence, with an extended dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) approach, this study proposes a new reliable method for call center arrivals’ forecasting that is able to capture the dynamics of a time series and to include contextual information in form of predictor variables. The study evaluates the predictive potential of the approach on the call and e-mail arrival series of a leading German online retailer comprising 174 weeks of data. The analysis involves time series cross-validation with an expanding rolling window over 52 weeks and comprises established time series as well as machine learning models as benchmarks. The multivariate DHR model outperforms the compared models with regard to forecast accuracy for a broad spectrum of lead times.

"In the current digital era, the humongous amount of data being generated has been impacting public lives in one or the other ways. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is related to contextual mining of texts which helps in identification and extraction of subjective information from the source material. Sentiment analysis is being used for brand monitoring and reputation management across different market segments. It helps to understand how the public perceive a particular brand, product or service that is highly useful for different tech companies, marketing agencies, media organizations, fashion brands etc. In today’s scenario we have been suffering with data overload which makes it impossible to analyze public sentiments without any sort of error or bias. Sentiment analysis provides better insights into the public reviews as it can be automated which ultimately helps in decision making. There are various deep learning and machine learning methods and models as well as natural language processing tools which help in examining and analyzing public opinions with low time complexity. However, deep learning methods have become highly popular in recent times as these models provide high efficiency and accuracy.

"According to the World Health Organization, vaccine hesitancy was one of the ten major threats to global health in 2019, including the COVID-19 vaccine. The availability of vaccines does not always mean utilization. This is because, people have less confidence in vaccines, which resulted in vaccination hesitancy and developing global decline in vaccine intake and has caused viral disease outbreaks worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to understand people’s perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine to help the manufacturing companies of the vaccine to improve their marketing strategy based on the rejection causes. In this paper, we used multi-class Sentiment Analysis to classify people’s opinions from extracted tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, using firstly different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and secondly various Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNN-LSTM and RNN-GRU. Then, we investigated the analysis of the negative tweets to identify the causes of rejection using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Finally, we classified these negative tweets according to the rejection causes for all the vaccines using the same selected ML and DL models. The result of SA showed that DT gives the best performance with an accuracy of 92.26% and for DL models, GRU achieved 96.83%. Then, we identified five causes: Lack of safety, Side effect, Production problem, Fake news and Misinformation, and Cost. Furthermore, for the classification of the negative tweets according to the identified rejection causes, the LR achieved the best result with an accuracy of 89.97%.

"Social networks have become important objects of study in recent years. Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.",Michelessa M.; Hurter C.; Lim B.Y.; Ling J.N.S.; Cautis B.; Hargreaves C.A.,Tactical,10.3390/bdcc7030149,decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization,5.0,,15,0,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses the development of an end-to-end learning model (SGREEDYNN) for the selection of influential nodes in social networks, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on specific marketing strategies, data visualization, and user engagement.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Visual Explanations of Differentiable Greedy Model Predictions on the Influence Maximization Problem,2023
"Research has long debated the effectiveness of socio-demographics in understanding purchase behavior, with mixed conclusions. The appeal of socio-demographic data for customer relationship marketing is based on its low acquisition cost and the growing array of variables on which marketers can condition messages and offers. We reinvestigate the value of socio-demographic variables, focusing on the potential of machine learning procedures (MLPs) to extract a stronger and reliable signal than the standard linear-in-parameters (logistic) regression models. We explore how predictive power can be increased through the nonlinearities and interactions identified with MLPs; our experimental set ranges from well-established procedures to newer entrants in this space. We also examine causality vis-à-vis predictability using a propensity scoring approach. Empirics are based on six grocery product categories and more than 7,000 panelists. We find that, relative to logistic regression models, MLPs using demographic variables yield a 20% to 33% improvement in out-of-sample predictive accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Islam T.; Meade N.; Carson R.T.; Louviere J.J.; Wang J.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.07.004,Buy–no buy; Consumer targeting; Machine learning; Propensity score; Socio-demographic variables,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the use of machine learning procedures to improve predictive accuracy in understanding purchase behavior through socio-demographic variables, which aligns closely with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and customer targeting.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,The usefulness of socio-demographic variables in predicting purchase decisions: Evidence from machine learning procedures,2022
"Photographs with a human element are powerful in influencing viewers' perceptions and decision-making processes. However, rare quantitative evidence was detected about the best human presenting percentage and how it affects the intention. In this study, we decoded how human elements (presence or absence, low or high proportion) affect viewers' perceptions and intentions in nature/culture-based photographs. Innovatively, three deep learning models and two experiments were integrated. The results indicate that (1) in general, maintaining the proportion of human elements at less than 1% leads to the best positive perception, and (2) the viewers demonstrate different perceptions and intentions in viewing nature-based and culture-based photographs with the human element. Theoretically, we bring a new perspective and approach to understanding the marketing value of human elements in tourist-generated photographs. Practically, we provide specific and different clues in choosing photographs to promote cultural and natural destinations regarding human elements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Zhang K.; Zhang J.; Yang J.,Tactical,10.1016/j.tourman.2022.104684,Behavioral intentions; Deep learning model; Destination perception; Human elements; Tourist-generated photographs,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study provides insights into how human elements in photographs can affect viewer perceptions and decisions, aligning with tactical marketing strategies to optimize the choice of photographs for promoting cultural and natural destinations.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,The influence of human elements in photographs on tourists' destination perceptions and intentions,2023
"Against the backdrop of increasing smartwatch usage and the dynamic landscape of evolving features, a nuanced understanding of consumer opinions and preferences is vital for tailoring features and crafting effective marketing strategies. This study addresses this imperative by conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews on smartwatches, aiming to determine the pivotal factors guiding consumer purchasing decisions. By employing word clouds to visually represent sentiments, the study uncovers notable trends. Positive reviews prominently highlight the term “quality”, suggesting a strong emphasis on product excellence. In contrast, negative reviews were characterized by the prevalence of the term “fake”, indicating concerns related to authenticity. Additionally, a comparative assessment of two machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines and Naive Bayes, demonstrates that support vector machines exhibit superior accuracy in classification. These findings offer valuable insights for industry practitioners navigating the competitive landscape of the smartwatch market, providing actionable information for optimizing product features and refining marketing strategies to meet consumer expectations. © 2024 by the author(s).

"We estimate the causal effects of different targeted email promotions on the opening and purchase decisions of the consumerswho receive them. To do so,we synthesize and extend recent advances in causal machine learning techniques to capture heterogeneity in the content of the email subject line itself as well as heterogeneous consumer responses to the promotional offers and semantic choices contained therein. We find that content and framing are important for driving performance. We identify precise causal estimates of the effects of individual deal components, personalized content, and various semantic choices on consumer outcomes all theway down the conversion funnel. The decompositional nature of our methodology allows us to show how different combinations of key words and promotional inducements produce significantly different outcomes, both within a given stage and across all stages of the funnel. Notably, discounts framed as clearance events sharply outperform those tied to particular products. We also find components that drive engagement at the top of the funnel don’t always lead to conversion at the bottom: their efficacy, across the funnel, is significantly moderated by the engagement levels of the consumers who receive them. Finally, leveraging both aspects of heterogeneity,we use off-policy evaluation to demonstrate the potential for significant gains fromimproved targeting. © 2023, INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

"Social Customer Relationship Management (social CRM) has become one of the central points for many companies seeking to improve their customer experience. It comprises a set of processes that allows decision-makers to analyze customer data, in order to launch an efficient, customer-centric, and cost-effective marketing strategy. Nonetheless, the inclusion of social media data in CRM introduces new challenges, as it requires advanced analytical approaches to extract actionable insight from such a huge amount of data. Thus, in this paper, we propose a social CRM analytic framework, which includes various analytical approaches, aiming at improving customer retention, acquisition, and conversion. This framework has been tested on various datasets and extensively evaluated based on several performance metrics. The obtained results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively extract relevant information and support decision-making processes. From an academics perspective, the study contributes to an understanding of customers’ experiences throughout their engagement on social media and focuses on long-term relationships with customers. From a managerial perspective, companies should leverage the insight generated through every customer engagement on social media to drive effective marketing strategies. © 2021",Lamrhari S.; Ghazi H.E.; Oubrich M.; Faker A.E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121275,Acquisition; Conversion; Customer retention; Customer satisfaction; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social CRM; Social media,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a social CRM analytic framework aimed at improving customer retention, acquisition, and conversion.

"This paper reviews the research literature on forecasting retail demand. We begin by introducing the forecasting problems that retailers face, from the strategic to the operational, as sales are aggregated over products to stores and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches. The paper concludes by describing company forecasting practices, offering conclusions as to both research gaps and barriers to improved practice. © 2019 International Institute of Forecasters",Fildes R.; Ma S.; Kolassa S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2019.06.004,Comparative accuracy; Forecasting practice; Marketing analytics; New products; Product hierarchies; Retail forecasting; Social media data,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses forecasting methods and practices that relate to operational decisions at the store level, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"This paper addresses the use of a customer character model as a determinant of used auto loan churn among a unique population of subprime borrowers. The customer character model (i.e restricted model) is compared to a full model consisting of the 4 Cs of capacity, collateral, credit, and character of churn prediction. The results reveal that there is a difference between the full model and the customer character model. Additionally, different supervised classification methods, such as logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision trees (DTs), and random forests (RFs), are applied and compared in terms of multiple predictive performance measures. The RF classification measures report the strongest performance. Additionally, different classification methods suggest the importance of different customer character variables. Therefore, from a practical perspective, effective borrower character screening is recommended to determine customer profiles more accurately for the purposes of target marketing and customer retention. This study also deepens understanding of subprime credit markets and reveals additional insights to credit screening using machine learning techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Valluri C.; Raju S.; Patil V.H.,Tactical,10.1057/s41270-021-00135-6,4 Cs; Auto loans; Churn; Classification techniques; Credit screening; Machine learning; Subprime; Supervised learning,5.0,,15,0,Palgrave Macmillan,"The abstract discusses the application of various supervised classification methods to predict used auto loan churn among subprime borrowers.

"Emotion detection is a promising field of research in multiple perspectives such as psychology, marketing, network analysis and so on. Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Bhattacharya S.; Agarwala A.; Roy S.,Tactical,10.1007/s13278-022-00957-x,COVID Twitter data; Machine learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the development and comparison of mood detection models, which aligns with tactical decision-making in optimizing and analyzing marketing strategies, specifically in the context of sentiment analysis and user engagement through text data.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Mood detection and prediction using conventional machine learning techniques on COVID19 data,2022
"The nature of people's web navigation has significantly changed in recent years. The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",De Smedt J.; Lacka E.; Nita S.; Kohls H.-H.; Paton R.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113579,Sequence mining; Session fingerprinting; Session stitching; Web analytics,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a method of linking web sessions to specific users through machine learning, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on implementing strategies to improve marketing outcomes, such as customer analysis and session stitching.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Session stitching using sequence fingerprinting for web page visits,2021
"Purpose: The rapid development of e-commerce has brought not only great convenience to people but a great challenge to online stores. Phenomenon such as out of stock and slow sales has been common in recent years. These issues can be managed only when the occurrence of the sales volume is predicted in advance, and sufficient warnings can be executed in time. Thus, keeping in mind the importance of the sales prediction system, the purpose of this paper is to propose an effective sales prediction model and make digital marketing strategies with the machine learning model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the consumer purchasing behavior decision theory, we discuss the factors affecting product sales, including external factors, consumer perception, consumer potential purchase behavior and consumer traffic. Then we propose a sales prediction model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, using the time-series prediction that ensures the effective prediction of sales about each product in a short time on online stores based on the sales data in the previous term or month or year. The proposed M-GNA-XGBOOST model serves as an adaptive prediction model, for which the instant factors and the sales data of the previous period are the input, and the optimal computation is based on the proposed methodology. The adaptive prediction using the proposed model is developed based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The model inherits the advantages among the algorithms with better accuracy and forecasts the sales of each product in the store with instant data characteristics for the first time. Findings: The analysis using Jingdong dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is enhanced and the accuracy that instant data as input is found to be better compared with the model that lagged data as input. The root means squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed model are found to be around 11.9 and 8.23. According to the sales prediction of each product, the resource can be arranged in advance, and the marketing strategy of product positioning, product display optimization, inventory management and product promotion is designed for online stores. Originality/value: The paper proposes and implements a new model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, to predict sales of each product for online stores.

"Purpose – This paper explores various supervised machine learning algorithms as an additional classification method to RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) models with the aim of improving the accuracy in predicting target groups of customers for direct marketing response campaigns conducted by a casino. The purpose of this paper is twofold – first, to test how the addition of demographic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach – Our research employed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino’s direct marketing activities to improve the company’s RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications – The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company’s own RFM segmentation was also found to perform well. Limitations – Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models’ power. While all models developed are applicable to similar data, they could lose their accuracy when applied to data from a different industry. The company’s own RFM model was not analyzed but was included in the model as is. Further insight could be gained by determining its optimal pa-rameters. Originality – This study contributes to the existing litera-ture by showing how direct marketing efficiency modeling using standard RFM could be improved with the addition of a company’s customer property. It also provides insight into how classification algorithms perform on a casino database of direct marketing activities. © 2023, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

"Due to the tremendous expansion of Chinese outbound travel market, it is of great significance to identify the characteristics of potential Chinese outbound tourists so as to develop targeted marketing strategies. As both extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of individuals are important in influencing their decision-making process, this study explores potential Chinese outbound tourists from these two aspects. Demographic and psychographic factors, as the proxy of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics, respectively, are incorporated into this study to construct the relationship between tourists' characteristics and their intentions of outbound travel. An advanced machine learning approach, called twice-learning, is employed for modelling in this study. As an intelligent data analysis tool, this method is able to construct models that can provide insight into the ground-truth relationships hidden beneath the data in an essentially comprehensible way, without being limited by the typical assumptions held by the traditional data analysis methods.

"It is challenging to forecast total sales of short life-cycle products due to a lack of historical sales data. Multi-source information combination methods make it possible to depict different kinds of characteristics and features, given a limited volume of samples. Evidence theory is a common approach used for multi-source combinations. This paper proposes a new method, named ‘Multi-Evidence Dynamic Weighted Combination Forecasting (MEDWCF)’, based on improvements in the application of Evidence theory. Two kinds of machine learning methods are used to solve the basic probability assignment generation problem pertaining to Evidence theory, so a dynamic update combination algorithm is proposed. These innovations improve the classical one-step static combination rules. Samples of 313 films launched within 2016 and 2017 proved that compared with other forecasting methods, MEDWCF has more effectiveness and better generalisation ability.

"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known “learn-and-earn” trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser’s MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel. © 2017 INFORMS.",Schwartz E.M.; Bradlow E.T.; Fader P.S.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.1023,A/B testing; Adaptive experiments; Earning-and-learning; Explore-exploit; Field experiments; Hierarchical models; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandit; Online advertising; Reinforcement learning; Sequential decision making,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the implementation of multi-armed bandit methods for online advertising campaigns, focusing on optimizing ad impressions and customer acquisition rates, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Customer acquisition via display advertising using multi-armed bandit experiments,2017

"Purpose: Predicting customers’ purchase behaviors is a challenging task. The literature has introduced the individual-level and the segment-based predictive modeling approaches for this purpose. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and performs in certain cases. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach which predicts customers’ individual purchase behaviors and reduces the limitations of these two methods by combining the advantages of them. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hybrid approach is established based on individual-level and segment-based approaches and utilizes the historical transactional data and predictive algorithms to generate predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in the domain of supermarket shopping by using real-world data and using five popular machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests. Findings: A comparison of results shows that the proposed hybrid approach substantially outperforms the individual-level and the segment-based approaches in terms of prediction coverage while maintaining roughly comparable prediction accuracy to the individual-level method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that logistic regression performs better than the other classifiers in predicting customer purchase behavior. Practical implications: The study concludes that the proposed approach would be beneficial for enterprises in terms of designing customized services and one-to-one marketing strategies.

"Today's Internet marketing ecosystems are very complex, with many competing players, transactions concluded within milliseconds, and hundreds of different parameters to be analyzed in the decision-making process. In addition, both sellers and buyers operate under uncertainty, without full information about auction results, purchasing preferences, and strategies of their competitors or suppliers. As a result, most market participants strive to optimize their trading strategies using advanced machine learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a new approach to determining reserve-price strategies for publishers, focusing not only on the profits from individual ad impressions, but also on maximum coverage of advertising space. This strategy combines the heuristics developed by experienced RTB consultants with machine learning forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet. The paper analyses the effectiveness of these algorithms, recommends the best one, and presents its implementation in real environment. As such, its results may form a basis for a competitive advantage for publishers on very demanding online advertising markets.  © 2020 Andrzej Wodecki, published by Sciendo 2020.",Wodecki A.,Tactical,10.2478/fman-2020-0013,forecasting; machine learning; online marketing; real-time bidding; reserve price optimization,5.0,,15,0,Sciendo,"The abstract discusses optimizing trading strategies using advanced machine learning algorithms, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"In the industry of video content providers such as VOD and IPTV, predicting the popularity of video contents in advance is critical, not only for marketing but also for network usage. By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts. Experiments are carried out with a dataset from one of the top streaming service companies, and results display overall better performance compared to various standalone methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Jeon H.; Seo W.; Park E.; Choi S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120303,Deep learning; Embeddings; Gradient boosting decision tree; Popularity prediction; Streaming service,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting the popularity of unpublished video content, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on specific marketing goals such as user engagement and content optimization.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Hybrid machine learning approach for popularity prediction of newly released contents of online video streaming services,2020
"Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Ahani A.; Nilashi M.; Yadegaridehkordi E.; Sanzogni L.; Tarik A.R.; Knox K.; Samad S.; Ibrahim O.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.06.014,Canary islands; Customer satisfaction; Hotel; Machine learning; Market segmentation; Multi-criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preferences analysis,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research focuses on interpreting customer satisfaction and preferences derived from online reviews to inform hotel managers' marketing strategies.

"The impact of the development of the internet and new communications channels on the marketing industry pushed practitioners to devise new tools and approaches for influencing consumer attitudes and behaviors towards products and services. This has led to new insights into persuasive message design. In general, persuasive advertisement messaging can be viewed as a combination of context, i.e., a message, and additional affiliated components such as images, video, and special graphics. It is composed out of two main attribute categorizations: (1) textual content such as a product description or affiliated message and (2) sensible content such as product image, color, or even scent. In a competitive market in which consumers are constantly exposed to a hyper-abundance of products that also contain sensible attributes, it is crucial to design persuasive messages that will maximally appeal to desired consumers and evoke their positive response. Yet only a few studies have focused on the effective design of persuasive advertisement messages characterized by two integrated elements. As such, this research focuses on effective persuasive message design with integrated product scent and color attributes. We demonstrate how a machine learning process can be utilized to generate optimal persuasive messages by estimating the contribution of each message attribute to the final class attribute: the purchase intention response. Our results show that several prediction algorithms can enhance consumer response value. In addition, correlations between several attributes affiliated with the message can be derived by graph theory-based estimation. This research thus provides insight into attribute values important for management decisions, with implications for effective persuasive message design. Ultimately, this may lead to higher response rates for marketing practitioners in an increasingly competitive market. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Zwilling M.; Levy S.; Gvili Y.; Dostal P.,Tactical,10.1007/s11135-020-00972-0,Advertising; Machine learning; Product design; Symbolic design,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The research focuses on effective persuasive message design, which involves the application of machine learning to optimize marketing strategies.

"Recently, it has become easier to make use of various kinds of information on customers (e.g. customers' purchase history), due to the development of information technology. Especially in the marketing field, in fact, many companies try to employ customer segmentation for the services customization which leads to increase customer loyalty and to keep high customer retention. One of the well-known approaches for the customer analysis based on purchase history data is the RFM analysis. The RFM analysis is usually used to segment customers into several groups by using three variables; how long it has been since their last purchase, how many times they purchased, and how much they spent. However, the conventional method of the RFM analysis did not assume a generative model. Therefore, when applying to an actual data set and scoring each index of R, F, M scores, several problems occur. The main problem is that an analyst should arbitrarily decide the threshold for the scores of RFM. On the other hand, in the field of machine learning, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis is widely used for soft clustering. The latent class model enables us to cluster customers into latent classes and to calculate the assignment probabilities of each customer to each latent class. In this paper, we propose a new latent class model for the RFM analysis based on the purchase history data. The proposed model enables to decide the scoring of RFM and segment customers automatically, and the soft clustering approach helps the interpretation of the result. Furthermore, the proposed model takes account of the generation model of RFM scores. From the result of actual data analysis, it became clear that it is possible to extract latent classes that express the statistical characteristics of data well. Given a generative model estimated from the given data, it is also possible to predict future purchase behaviors of customers or to generate virtual data for simulation analysis and make decisions based on the result. We verify the effectiveness of our model by analyzing a real purchase history data of a Japanese major retail company. © 2020 KIIE",Zhang Q.; Yamashita H.; Mikawa K.; Goto M.,Tactical,10.7232/IEMS.2020.19.2.476,Latent Class Model; Marketing Segmentation; RFM Analysis,5.0,,15,0,Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers,"The abstract discusses the development of a new model for RFM analysis aimed at improving customer segmentation and retention strategies, which falls under tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Online reviews have become one of the most influential persuasive messages concerning decisions making. Researchers have explored different aspects of online reviews and the characteristics of reviewers using various methods; however, few studies have focused on consumers who do not post online reviews after purchasing, resulting in a gap in the research. This study aims to identify consumers’ characteristics and analyze the importance of consumers in different online review scenarios. We employed a fusion analysis framework, which used machine learning to determine the value of different types of consumers; in addition, we quantitatively estimate the relationship between variables and consumer types using econometrics modelling. This research used real consumer data from three data resources, solving problems related to the use of limited questionnaire datasets and single-source data. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that lurkers are more valuable than posters because they can be easily served and create more profit; thus, researchers should consider those who do not post online reviews rather than focusing only on the influence of online reviews and posters. Our findings also provide managerial implications for precision marketing by indicating that e-marketers should employ various marketing strategies and pay attention to different types of consumers, especially lurkers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Li Y.; Zhang L.,Tactical,10.1080/0144929X.2020.1759691,consumer characteristics; E-commerce; fusion analysis; Online review scenarios; precision marketing,5.0,,15,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The study analyzes consumer characteristics and the importance of different consumer types in online review scenarios, which aligns with structuring decisions related to marketing strategies and precision marketing.

"Consumers’ preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model. © 2017 INFORMS.",Chen Y.; Iyengar R.; Iyengar G.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.0992,Conjoint analysis; Multimodal continuous heterogeneity; Sparse machine learning,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a modeling approach for understanding consumer preferences and segmentation, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The authors test methods, based on cognitively simple decision rules, that predict which products consumers select for their consideration sets. Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-ofconjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machinelearning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of competing methods and model selection, which are non-trivial issues given the financial implications. Researchers have adopted various methods including statistical models and machine learning methods such as neural networks to assist decision making in direct marketing. However, due to the different performance criteria and validation techniques currently in practice, comparing different methods is often not straightforward. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the performance of neural networks with that of classification and regression tree, latent class models and logistic regression using three criteria - simple error rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and cumulative lift - and two validation methods, i.e. bootstrap and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Systematic experiments are conducted to compare their performance. Findings - The results suggest that these methods vary in performance across different criteria and validation methods. Overall, neural networks outperform the others in AUROC value and cumulative lifts, and the stratified ten-fold cross-validation produces more accurate results than bootstrap validation. Practical implications - To select predictive models to support direct marketing decisions, researchers need to adopt appropriate performance criteria and validation procedures.

"Setting the retail price as a part of marketing would affect customers' cognition regarding products and affect their post-purchase behavior of review writing. To deeply understand the relationships between retail prices and reviews, this paper designs an intelligent data-driven Generate/Test Cycle using a machine learning technique to automatically discover the relationship model from a huge amount of data without a prior hypothesis. From a unique dataset, various free-form relationship models with their own structures and parameters have been discovered. By the comprehensive evaluations of candidate models, a guided map was offered to understand the relationship between dynamic retail prices and the volume/valence of reviews for different types of products. Experimental results show that 37.69% of products in our sample exhibit the following trend: When the price is increased to a certain level, the volume of reviews shifts from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend. Results also demonstrate that a linearly increasing relationship model between prices and the valence of reviews is more suitable for the low-involvement products than for the high-involvement products.

"Consumers often choose products by first forming a consideration set and then choosing from among considered products. When there are many products to screen (or many features to evaluate), it is rational for consumers to use consider-then-choose decision processes and to do so with heuristic decision rules. Managerial decisions (product development, marketing communications, etc.) depend upon the ability to identify and react to consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. We provide managerial examples and review the state-of-the-art in the theory and measurement of consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules.

"Marketing professionals face challenges of increasing complexity to adapt classic marketing strategies to the phenomenon of social networks. Companies are currently trying to take advantage of the useful collective knowledge available on social networks to support different types of marketing decisions. The appropriate analysis of this information can offer marketing professionals with important competitive advantages. This work proposes a new methodology to extract the social collective behavior of Twitter users concerning a group of brands based on the users’ temporal activity. Time series of mentions made by individual users to each company's Twitter account are aggregated to obtain collective activity data for the companies, which is a consequence of both the company's and other users’ actions. These data are processed using classical unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as temporal clustering and hidden Markov models, to extract collective temporal behavior patterns and models of the dynamics of customers over time for a single brand and groups of brands. The derived knowledge can be used for different tasks, such as identifying the impact of a marketing campaign on Twitter and comparatively assessing the social behaviors of different brands and groups of brands to assist in making marketing decisions. Our methodology is validated in a case study from the wine market. Twitter data were gathered from four regions of different countries around the world with important wineries (Italy: Veneto, Portugal: Porto and Douro Valley, Spain: La Rioja, and United States: Napa Valley), and comparative behavior analysis was carried out from the perspective of the use of Twitter as a communication channel for marketing campaigns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bello-Orgaz G.; Mesas R.M.; Zarco C.; Rodriguez V.; Cordón O.; Camacho D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102220,Hidden Markov models; Marketing analysis; Social collective behavior; Social networks; Temporal clustering; Temporal Twitter Activity; Wineries,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses methodologies for analyzing Twitter data to extract collective behavior patterns and assist in making marketing decisions, which aligns closely with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Increasingly popular social networks have become fast-growing platforms for information sharing, job searching, and product marketing. Information propagates rapidly in social network and may reach a very large population within a very short period of time. An excessive amount of information shared in social networks not only costs computational and communicational resources but also causes the information overload problem, which results in the delay and difficulty of making decisions and may lead to physical and psychological strain. We used computer technologies to attack this information overload problem. First, we developed automatic decision-making mechanisms to help each individual effectively share information. Second, we built a simulation test bed and proposed an evaluation matrix and then conducted an experimental evaluation of six different information-sharing strategies in terms of interest degrees, reachability, appreciation degrees, and communication cost. We also implemented two intelligent response mechanisms. The first one allows users to order information pieces according to the learned ratings of the information sources. The second mechanism dynamically adjusts the network structure based on machine-learning results. The simulation results show that such mechanisms would be very useful to motivate social-network users to adopt more selective information-sharing strategies. © 2014 IEEE.",Zhang X.S.; Zhang X.; Kaparthi P.,Tactical,10.1109/TCSS.2020.3001093,Information overload; information sharing; intelligent response; social networks,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract discusses the development of automatic decision-making mechanisms and information-sharing strategies, which align with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Combat Information Overload Problem in Social Networks with Intelligent Information-Sharing and Response Mechanisms,2020

"Recently, the rapid growth in the number of customer reviews on e-commence platforms and in the amount of user-generated content has begun to have a profound impact on customer purchasing decisions. To counter the negative impact of social media marketing, some firms have begun hiring people to generate fake reviews which either promote their own products or damage their competitor’s reputation. This study proposes a framework, which takes advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, for the observation of behaviors among spammers. Then, based on the behavior of participants on web forums, the authors build up a post-reply network. The main focus is on the behavior-related features of the reviews, their propagation, and their popularity. The primary objective of this study is to build an effective online spammer detection model and the method detailed in this work can be used to improve the performance of spammer detection models. An experiment is carried out with a real dataset, the results of which indicate that these new features are important for identifying spammers.

"Social applications foster the involvement of end users in Web content creation, as a result of which a new source of vast amounts of data about users and their likes and dislikes has become available. Having access to users’ contributions to social sites and gaining insights into the consumers’ needs is of the utmost importance for marketing decision making in general, and to advertisement recommendation in particular. By analyzing this information, advertisement recommendation systems can attain a better understanding of the users’ interests and preferences, thus allowing these solutions to provide more precise ad suggestions. However, in addition to the already complex challenges that hamper the performance of recommender systems (i.e., data sparsity, cold-start, diversity, accuracy and scalability), new issues that should be considered have also emerged from the need to deal with heterogeneous data gathered from disparate sources. The technologies surrounding Linked Data and the Semantic Web have proved effective for knowledge management and data integration. In this work, an ontology-based advertisement recommendation system that leverages the data produced by users in social networking sites is proposed, and this approach is substantiated by a shared ontology model with which to represent both users’ profiles and the content of advertisements. Both users and advertisement are represented by means of vectors generated using natural language processing techniques, which collect ontological entities from textual content.

"Product innovation, based on the identification and implementation of new solutions, is essential to keep a company competitive. However, the risk of failure of a new solution must be properly weighted during the decision-making in the design activity. This study proposes a method to evaluate a new design solution through the comparison with an old one to be substituted, and based on their requirements. In order to better evaluate the new solution, new requirements about its specific peculiarities are extracted from patents of similar solutions and considered in the evaluation. Requirements extraction is carried out automatically, through natural language processing, while the evaluation considers technical, marketing, and economic criteria. In particular, financial proceeds and patents investments were considered.

"[Purpose/Significance] Geographical indications (GIs) are an important tool for local governments in China to carry out brand building of agricultural products. Brand management is a continuous systematic project involving multiple subjects. Among them, the problem of government policy attention in the field of brand management of agricultural products with GIs deserves in-depth study. This paper aims to construct a policy attention analysis model in the field of brand management of GI agricultural products based on natural language processing technology. This model provides technical support for local governments to explore the status quo of local GI agricultural products' brand management, analyze the distribution of policy attention, and assist in optimizing strategies to promote their products' brand development. [Method/Process] The study is focused on the distribution of attention paths of GI agricultural products' brand management policies from the perspective of the local government: an analysis model of brand management policies of GI agricultural products was constructed in order to support the local government to carry out the analysis of the status quo of local agricultural products' brand management and policy optimization, and provide decision-making support for the optimization of brand management measures of the local agricultural products. First, this paper built a basic corpus based on the Python crawler technology, collected authoritative public information on the Internet, utilized the domain dictionary and UIE general information extraction framework to extract the text of management measures published in local government policies, and built a database of brand management measures of GI agricultural product. Second, a classification model of brand management measures of GI agricultural products based on the Transformer model was constructed. Third, this paper built a classification model based on the Transformer model, which can classify the extracted brand management measures of agricultural products and construct the policy attention distribution map. Finally, based on the policy attention distri-bution given by the model, we can find the brand management bottlenecks and recommend countermeasures to solve the bottlenecks. [Results/Conclusions] This paper takes Yantai apples as an example for model validation. After extracting and categorizing Yantai apples' brand management data, it is found that the policy attention of Yantai apples is more con-centrated, and the measures are highly similar, with 41.1% of the text of the measures focused on the part of brand positioning and planning, 31.7% on the part of brand competitiveness enhancement, and less than 10% on the part of brand marketing and protection. It can be seen that the brand effect of Yantai apples with GIs has not been well utilized. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology/Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi.

"Increasingly, on-demand nature of customer interactions put pressure on companies to build real-time campaign management systems. Instead of having managers to decide on the campaign rules, such as, when, how and whom to offer, creating intelligent campaign management systems that can automate such decisions is essential. In addition, regulations or company policies usually restrict the number of accesses to the customers. Efficient learning of customer behaviour through dynamic campaign participation observations becomes a crucial feature that may ultimately define customer satisfaction and retention. This paper builds on the recent successes of deep learning techniques and proposes a classification model to predict customer responses for campaigns. Classic deep neural networks are good at learning hidden relations within data (i.e., patterns) but with limited capability for memorization. One solution to increase memorization is to use manually craft features, as in Wide & Deep networks, which are originally proposed for Google Play App. recommendations. We advocate using decision trees as an easier way of mining high-level relationships for enhancing Wide & Deep networks. Such an approach has the added benefit of beating manually created rules, which, most of the time, use incomplete data and have biases. A set of comprehensive experiments on campaign participation data from a leading GSM provider shows that automatically crafted features make a significant increase in the accuracy and outperform Deep and Wide & Deep models with manually crafted features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Ayvaz D.; Aydoğan R.; Akçura M.T.; Şensoy M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101058,Decision tree classification; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Real-time marketing; Wide & Deep network models,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses building real-time campaign management systems and automating decisions related to customer interactions, which falls under tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into structured targets like campaign automation and customer acquisition.",scopus-neural network,15,70,Campaign participation prediction with deep learning,2021

"One of the key problems in database marketing is the identification and profiling of households that are most likely to be interested in a particular product or service. Principal component analysis (PCA) of customer background information followed by logistic regression analysis of response behavior is commonly used by database marketers. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) guided by genetic algorithms (GAs) to target households. We show that the resulting selection rule is more accurate and more parsimonious than the PCA/logit rule when the manager has a clear decision criterion.

"Abstract Mobile-enabled location-based services are generating a huge amount of customer checkin data every day. It is vital to understand how small businesses, like restaurants, use this real-time data to make better-informed business operation decisions in this mobile marketing era. Using data collected from Foursquare, a leading location-based service provider, and Yelp, we aim to find out the predictive power of customer checkins on business failure of restaurants in New York City by using several predictive modeling techniques, such as Neural Network, Logit model and K-nearest neighbor. Our findings are encouraging. The customer checkin data from both a focal restaurant and its neighbors have shown strong predictive power on business failure. Compared to the baseline model in which we only use business characteristic variables to predict failure, incorporating the checkin data captured from location-based services gives a remarkable improvement on predictive accuracy.

"User reviews are now an essential source of information for consumers, exerting strong influence on purchase decisions. Broadly speaking, reviews rated by consumers as more helpful exert a greater influence downstream. The current research examines how the linguistic characteristics of a review affect its helpfulness score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), this research analyzes the linguistic subjectivity and objectivity of over 2 million reviews on Amazon. The results show that, ceteris paribus, both linguistic subjectivity and objectivity have a positive impact on review helpfulness. However, contrary to consumers' intuition, when subjectivity and objectivity are combined in the same review, review helpfulness increases less than their respective separate effects would predict, especially for hedonic products. We conceptualize that this results from the increased complexity of messages mixing subjective and objective sentences, which requires more effortful processing. The findings extend the literature on online reviews, word-of-mouth, and text analysis in marketing, and offer practical implications for marketing communication and facilitation of reviews. © 2023 Society for Consumer Psychology.",Park S.K.; Song T.; Sela A.,Tactical,10.1002/jcpy.1382,neural network; online reviews; subjectivity; text analysis; word-of-mouth,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses how linguistic characteristics of consumer reviews affect their helpfulness, which pertains to structured decision-making in marketing communications and optimization of review strategies.

"To explore the minimization of the marketing cost and the maximization of the user perceived utility, an optimization model for mobile banking adoption with incomplete information is developed. A combination of qualitative simulation and empirical study can serve as a solution to the optimization problem. Firstly, we use mobile banking system as an example with questionnaire designed to obtain data from customers, which is then statistically analyzed using SPSS to examine the interactions among adoption drivers. Secondly, a qualitative simulation method is introduced to drive the evolution of the interactions among these adoption drivers. Thirdly, according to the empirical relations, an optimization model is established, and the objective functions are examined by the BP neural network. Then, to examine the feasibility of the framework, a prototype system based on MATLAB is implemented. It is found that the results are consistent with common sense (oscillation-equilibrium theory), and the framework is able to contribute to real-time optimization decision supports in the mobile banking marketing.

"The study of brand choice decisions with multiple alternatives has been successfully modelled for more than a decade using the Multinomial Logit model. Recently, neural network modelling has received increasing attention and has been applied to an array of marketing problems such as market response or segmentation. We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Logit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Logit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Logit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics. The method is illustrated on an artificial dataset where the market is heterogeneous. We then apply the approach to panel scanner data of purchase records, using the Logit to analyse the non-linearities detected by the neural network.

"With the development of mobile Web technologies, people can easily seek advice from social media before making purchases or decisions. Some companies employ expert writers to fabricate reviews or use automated techniques to improve the appeal of their products or services, or to undermine the credibility of their rivals. This obstructs the detection of fake reviews and reviewers. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network-based framework for detecting spammers, who originate fake reviews in discussion forums to capture information from different social network combinations in various subgraphs. These subgraphs include a complete social context graph, homogeneous user–user subgraph, and heterogeneous user–post subgraph. A novel two-stage architecture with focal loss was designed to create a training model. This model can be applied to solve the issue of imbalance data classification. The proposed framework was applied to evaluate a ground truth dataset collected from an actual fraudulent review event on a discussion forum.

"Despite being one of the most symbolic, important, involving, costly, exciting, uncertain and complicated decisions most consumers make each year, holiday purchasing has received relatively little academic treatment in the service marketing literature. By extending and refining previous work, this study examines the usefulness of perceived risk theory to understand consumers' behaviour in one of the most common holiday experiences, the package holiday. Unlike other studies, this research undertakes a more detailed assessment of the risks involved, as well as examining how consumers reduce those risks. Forty-three risky attributes and fifteen risk reducers were identified and a neural network analysis uncovered a relationship between risk and risk reduction which involved functional, financial and hotel dominated risks, whilst the relationship between risk and purchase intention was mediated by trust in the tour operator and anxiety. The paper explores the nature of the risk in the holiday product and discusses how perceived risk can be measured and used by travel marketers in further research.

"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the value of Facebook data in predicting first-time donation behavior. More specifically, we provide evidence that Facebook data can be used as a valuable data source for nonprofit organizations in acquiring new donors. To do so, we evaluate three different dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e., singular value decomposition, non-negative matrix factorization, and latent Dirichlet allocation) over seven classification techniques (i.e., logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, bagged trees, random forest, adaboost, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks) using five times twofold cross-validation. Next, we assess what type of Facebook data and which predictors are most important. The results indicate that we can predict first-time donation behavior based on Facebook data with high predictive performance. Our benchmark indicates that the combination of singular value decomposition and logistic regression outperforms all other analytical methodologies with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.72 and a top decile lift of 3.33. The results show that Facebook pages and categories of Facebook pages are the most important data types. The most important predictors are dimensions related to age, education, residence, materialism, responsible consumption, and interest in nonprofits. The presented acquisition models can be used by nonprofit organizations to implement a one-to-one targeted marketing campaign towards Facebook fans.

"Nowadays, websites use a variety of recommendation systems to decide the content to display to their visitors. In this work, we use a multiarmed bandit approach to dynamically select the combination of house ads to exhibit to a heterogeneous set of customers visiting the website of a large retailer. House ads correspond to promotional information displayed on the website to highlight some specific products and are an important marketing tool for online retailers. As the number of clicks they receive not only depends on their own attractiveness but also on how attractive are other products displayed around them, we decide about complete collections of ads that capture those interactions. More-over, as ads can wear out, in our recommendations we allow for nonstationary rewards. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of customer-level information, we embed a deep neural network to provide personalized recommendations within a bandit scheme. We tested our methods in controlled experiments where we compared them against decisions made by an experienced team of managers and the recommendations of a variety of other bandit policies.

"Business sales forecasting is an example of management decision making in an ill-structured, uncertain problem domain. Due to the dynamic complexities of both internal and external corporate environments, many firms resort to qualitative forecasting techniques. However, these qualitative techniques lack the structure and extrapolation capability of quantitative forecasting models, and forecasting inaccuracies typically lead to dramatic disturbances in production planning. This paper presents the development of a hybrid econometric-neural network model for forecasting total monthly sales. This model attempts to integrate the structural characteristics of econometric models with the non-linear pattern recognition features of neural networks to create a ""hybrid"" modeling approach. A three-stage model is created that attempts to sequentially ""filter"" forecasts where the output from one stage becomes part of the input to the next stage. The forecasts from each of the individual sub-models are then ""averaged"" to compute the hybrid forecast. Model development is discussed in the content of an actual sales forecasting problem from a Danish company that produces consumer goods. Actual model performance is reported for a six-month time period.

"With the rise in use of social media to promote branded products, the demand for effective influencer marketing has increased. Brands are looking for improved ways to identify valuable influencers among a vast catalogue; this is even more challenging with micro-influencers, which are more affordable than mainstream ones but difficult to discover. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework to improve the state of the art in micro-influencer ranking based on multimedia content. Moreover, since the visual congruence between a brand and influencer has been shown to be a good measure of compatibility, we provide an effective visual method for interpreting our model's decisions, which can also be used to inform brands' media strategies. We compare with the current state of the art on a recently constructed public dataset and we show significant improvement both in terms of accuracy and model complexity.

"Personalized marketing in retail requires a model to predict how different marketing actions affect product choices by individual customers. Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

"The multinomial probit model introduced here combines heterogeneity across households with flexibility of the (deterministic) utility function. To achieve flexibility deterministic utility is approximated by a neural net of the multilayer perceptron type. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method serves to estimate heterogeneous multinomial probit models which fulfill economic restrictions on signs of (marginal) effects of predictors (e.g., negative for price). For empirical choice data the heterogeneous multinomial probit model extended by a multilayer perceptron clearly outperforms all the other models studied. Moreover, replacing homogeneous by heterogeneous reference price mechanisms and thus allowing price expectations to be formed differently across households also leads to better model performance. Mean utility differences and mean elasticities w.r.t. price and price deviation from reference price demonstrate that models with linear utility and nonlinear utility approximated by a multilayer perceptron lead to very different implications for managerial decision making.

"This study aims to incorporate Artificial Neural Networks into a Marketing Decision Support System (MDSS), specifically, by discovering important variables that influence sales performance of colour television (CTV) sets in the Singapore market using neural networks. Three kinds of variables, expert knowledge, marketing information and environmental data, are examined. The information about the effects of each of these variables has been studied and made available for decision making. However, their combined effect is unknown. This study attempts to explore the combined effect for the benefit of our collaborator, a multinational corporation (MNC) in the consumer electronics industry in Singapore. Putting these three variables together as input variables results in a neural network model. Neural network training is conducted using historical data on CTV sales in Singapore collected over the past one and a half years. Sensitivity analysis is then performed to reduce input variables of neural networks. This is done by analyzing the weights of the input node connections in the trained neural networks using two different methods. The weaker variables can be excluded, and this results in a simpler model. Further, an R-Square value of almost 1 is obtained through the inclusion of an Unknown variable when the network model consisting only of the most influential variables is trained and tested. Knowing the most influential variables, which in this case include Average Price, Screen Size, Stereo Systems, Flat-Square screen type and Seasonal Factors, marketing managers can improve sales performance by paying more attention to them.",Yao J.; Teng N.; Poh H.-L.; Tan C.L.,Tactical,,Artificial neural networks; Marketing decision support systems; Marketing mix; Sales forecasting; Variable reduction,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks to improve marketing decisions related to sales performance.

"Purpose: This research aims to determine the ideal fare for various aircraft itineraries by modeling prices using a neural network method. Dynamic pricing has been studied from the airline’s point of view, with a focus on demand forecasting and price differentiation. Early demand forecasting on a specific route can assist an airline in strategically planning flights and determining optimal pricing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A feedforward neural network was employed in the current study. Two hidden layers, consisting of 18 and 12 neurons, were incorporated to enhance the network’s capabilities. The activation function employed for these layers was tanh. Additionally, it was considered that the output layer’s functions were linear. The neural network inputs considered in this study were flight path, month of flight, flight date (week/day), flight time, aircraft type (Boeing, Airbus, other), and flight class (economy, business). The neural network output, on the other hand, was the ticket price. The dataset comprises 16,585 records, specifically flight data for Iranian airlines for 2022. Findings: The findings indicate that the model achieved a high level of accuracy in approximating the actual data. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to predict the optimal ticket price for various flight routes with minimal error.

"The direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are emerging to reach more number of consumers with more potential to meet their expectations. They are characterized through their metamorphosis as the vertical brands sell their products from the manufacturer to consumers directly without any interruptions from distribution channels as in traditional mode of doing business. They are annihilating themselves in the virtual platforms and later disrupting their existing linear sales models. This empirical investigation is targeted to construct an algorithmic model through a deep learning process which has been instrumental to predict the purchase decision. This investigation has churned a predictive model that is based on the attributes of the buying behaviour of the consumers. The attributes of online buying behaviour like safety of transaction, availability of innovative products and quality of products have been considered to build a predictive model through artificial neural network (ANN).

"Tourism shopping via mobile applications has revolutionized the tourism industry. The research examined the antecedents to the adoption of mobile tourism shopping (MTS) via an integrated model, consisting of the Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, consumer perception of merchant ethics, consumer decision-making styles, and characteristics of mobile applications. The results were empirically validated via the PLS-SEM-ANN method. The findings indicated that mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use, application quality, and service quality have significant positive correlations with the intention to use MTS, whereas privacy concern has displayed a significant negative relationship. Moreover, source reliability, application reputation, perfectionism, and novelty-fashion consciousness were revealed to be statistically insignificant to the development of adoption intention toward MTS. Furthermore, the ANN results have indicated the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute in the prediction of ANN Model A. The research has generated valuable theoretical implications and practical insights. For one, the advantages that come with the adoption of MTS and the security measures taken by the service providers should be highlighted to the prospects via effective marketing messages to nurture confidence, which can subsequently drive adoption. © 2021 International Association for Computer Information Systems.",Wan S.-M.; Cham L.-N.; Tan G.W.-H.; Lo P.-S.; Ooi K.-B.; Chatterjee R.-S.,Tactical,10.1080/08874417.2021.2004564,artificial neural network analysis; consumer decision-making; Mobile commerce; privacy concern; tourism,5.0,,15,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The research focuses on the factors influencing the adoption of mobile tourism shopping, which can inform targeted marketing strategies and user engagement tactics.

"This paper presents one of the possibilities of the decision theory that can be used in the modelling of the quality of life in a given city in the Czech Republic. Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city. Similar results were achieved through out our research when using the mentioned algorithms. However, the best results were achieved when using the C5.0 algorithm.

"Until now, neuromarketing studies have usually been aimed at assessing the predictive value of psychophysiological measures gathered while watching a marketing message related to a particular product. This study is the first attempt to verify the possibility of predicting familiar and unfamiliar brand purchases based on psychophysiological reactions to a retailer television advertisement measured by EEG, EDA and eye-tracking. The number of private label products chosen later served to assess the binary dependent variable. A logistic regression model (with a prediction rate of 61.2%) was applied to determine which psychophysiological variables explained the largest part of the variance of a final purchase decision. The results show that among various measures, only the electrodermal peaks per second were significant in predicting further purchase decisions.

"Games as a service is similar to software as a service, which provides players with game content on a continuous monetization model. Game revenue forecast is vital to game developers to make the right business decisions, such as determining the marketing budget, controlling the development cost, and setting up benchmarks for evaluating game publishing performance. How to make the revenue forecast and integrate it with the game publishing process is hard for small and medium-sized independent (indie) game developers. This includes all steps of the process, from forecasting to decision-making based on the results. This paper provides a data-driven method that uses the mobile game revenue forecast based on different time-series prediction models to drive the game publishing. We demonstrate how to use the data-driven method to guide an indie game studio to forecast revenue and then set the revenue forecast as the internal benchmark to drive game publishing. In practice, we involve a real game project from an indie game studio and provide guidance for one of their casual game projects. Then, based on the revenue forecast, we discuss how to set the revenue forecast as an internal benchmark and drive the actions for mobile game publishing.

"Strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) are highly perishable fruit. Timely prediction of yield is crucial for labor management and marketing decision-making. This study demonstrates the use of high-resolution ground-based imagery, in addition to previous yield and weather information, for yield prediction throughout the season at different intervals (3-4 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks preharvest). Flower and fruit counts, yield, and high-resolution imagery data were collected 31 times for two cultivars (‘Florida Radiance’ and ‘Florida Beauty’) throughout the growing season. Orthorectified mosaics and digital surface models were created to extract canopy size variables (canopy area, average canopy height, canopy height standard deviation, and canopy volume) and visually count flower and fruit number. Data collected at the plot level (6 plots per cultivar, 24 plants per plot) were used to develop prediction models. Using image-based counts and canopy variables, flower and fruit counts were predicted with percentage prediction errors of 26.3% and 25.7%, respectively. Furthermore, by adding image-derived variables to the models, the accuracy of predicting out-of-sample yields at different time intervals was increased by 10-29% compared to those models without image-derived variables. These results suggest that close-range high-resolution images can contribute to yield prediction and could assist the industry with decision making by changing growers’ prediction practices. © 2021 by the authors.",Abd-Elrahman A.; Wu F.; Agehara S.; Britt K.,Tactical,10.3390/ijgi10040239,Canopy size metrics; Fragaria x ananassa; High-resolution; Image analysis; Regression model,5.0,,15,0,MDPI AG,"The study emphasizes the practical application of high-resolution imagery for yield prediction in strawberry cultivation, which aligns with structured decision-making processes.

"The market basket data in the form of a binary user–item matrix or a binary item–user matrix can be modeled as a binary classification problem, which actually tackles collaborative filtering (CF) as well as target marketing. Effective variable selection (VS) can increase the prediction accuracy as well as identify important users or items in CF as well as target marketing. Therefore, we propose two new VS approaches: a Pearson correlation-based approach and a forward random forests regression-based approach, comparing the performance in a variety of experimental settings. The experimental results show that the proposed VS approaches outperform the conventional approaches in the examples. Furthermore, the experimental results are more reasonable and informative than the previous experimental results because the binary misclassification error and Top-N accuracy for the user CF, the item CF, the user modeling, and the item modeling are all considered in this paper. © 2018 The Authors.

"There is a growing need in the marketing field to understand how consumers can be persuaded to consume healthier products. This research makes novel predictions about the time-of-day effects on (un)healthy product purchases based on self-control theory. We investigated whether and how time of day (morning vs. evening) influences consumers’ (un)healthy product purchases. A field study based on point-of-sales data indicated that consumers tend to buy more unhealthy products in the evening. Two laboratory experiments confirmed that this is due to a decrease in self-control in the evening, which leads consumers to purchase more unhealthy products at this time. A follow-up eye-tracking experiment further revealed potential mechanisms whereby lower self-control causes consumers to focus more on unhealthy products and weakens the effect of attention to healthy products on purchases.

"Purpose: The rise of social media has led to the emergence of influencers and influencer marketing (IM) domains, which have become important areas of academic inquiry. However, despite its prominence as an area for study, several significant challenges must be addressed. One significant challenge involves identifying, assessing and recommending social media influencers (SMIs). This study proposes a semantic network model capable of measuring an influencer's performance on specific topics or subjects to address this issue. This study can assist managers in identifying suitable SMIs based on their estimated reach. Design/methodology/approach: Data from popular YouTube influencers and publicly available performance measures (views and likes) are extracted. Second, the titles of the past videos made by the influencer are used to develop a semantic network connecting all the videos to other videos based on similarity measures. Third, the nearest neighbor approach extracts the neighbors of the target title video. Finally, based on the set of neighbors, a range prediction is made for the views and likes of the target video with the influencer. Findings: The results show that the model can predict an accurate range of views and likes based on the suggested video titles and the content creator, with 69–78% accuracy across different influencers on YouTube. Research limitations/implications: The current study introduces a novel and innovative approach that exploits the textual association between a SMI's previous content to forecast the outcome of their future content. Although the findings are encouraging, this research recognizes various constraints that upcoming researchers may tackle. Forecasting views of posts concerning novel subjects and precisely adjusting video view counts based on their age constitute two primary limitations of this study. Practical implications: Managers interested in hiring influencers can employ the suggested approach to evaluate an influencer's potential performance on a specific topic. This research aids managers in making informed decisions regarding influencer selection, utilizing data-based metrics that are simple to comprehend and explain.

"We consider user retention analytics for online freemium role-playing games (RPGs). RPGs constitute a very popular genre of computer-based games that, along with a player's gaming actions, focus on the development of the player's in-game virtual character through a persistent exploration of the gaming environment. Most RPGs follow the freemium business model in which the gamers can play for free but they are charged for premium add-on amenities. As with other freemium products, RPGs suffer from the curse of high dropout rates. This makes retention analysis extremely important for successful operation and survival of their gaming portals. Here, we develop a disciplined statistical framework for retention analysis by modelling multiple in-game player characteristics along with the dropout probabilities. We capture players’ motivations through engagement times, collaboration and achievement score at each level of the game, and jointly model them using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm) framework that further includes a time-to-event variable corresponding to churn. We capture the interdependencies in a player's level-wise engagement, collaboration, achievement with dropout through a shared parameter model. We illustrate interesting changes in player behaviours as the gaming level progresses. The parameters in our joint model were estimated by a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm which incorporated a divide-and-recombine approach for increased scalability in glmm estimation that was needed to accommodate our large longitudinal gaming data-set. By incorporating the level-wise changes in a player's motivations and using them for dropout rate prediction, our method greatly improves on state-of-the-art retention models. Based on data from a popular action based RPG, we demonstrate the competitive optimality of our proposed joint modelling approach by exhibiting its improved predictive performance over competitors. In particular, we outperform aggregate statistics based methods that ignore level-wise progressions as well as progression tracking non-joint model such as the Cox proportional hazards model. We also display improved predictions of popular marketing retention statistics and discuss how they can be used in managerial decision making. © 2021 Royal Statistical Society",Karmakar B.; Liu P.; Mukherjee G.; Che H.; Dutta S.,Tactical,10.1111/rssa.12730,,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract focuses on user retention analytics for online freemium RPGs, which involves structured decision-making to improve player retention and engagement.

"Online games make up the largest segment of the booming global game market in terms of revenue as well as players. Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-Tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-Task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Our work has been implemented and deployed in many online games released from NetEase Games. Online A/B testing in production shows that perCLTV achieves a prominent improvement in two precision marketing applications of popup recommendation and churn intervention. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Zhao S.; Wu R.; Tao J.; Qu M.; Zhao M.; Fan C.; Zhao H.,Tactical,10.1145/3530012,churn prediction; multi-Task learning; online games; payment prediction; Personalized customer lifetime value,5.0,,10,0,Association for Computing Machinery,"The abstract discusses a specific system for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) in online games, which involves targeted applications like churn intervention and personalized marketing strategies.

"Virtual reality can influence consumer behavior in powerful ways, but in the domain of tourism marketing, less is known about the psychological process. One possibility is that VR has stronger impact on mental imagery than traditional channels, creating vivid simulations of what it would be like to visit destinations. This process might create hedonic expectations of future happiness, which should increase the willingness to actually seek out the destination in real life. The results from a laboratory experiment provided support to this hypothesis. Participants were randomly assigned to view a nature destination either in traditional still images or virtual reality, and then reported their initial responses before making an actual consumer choice. VR exposure led to higher levels of mental imagery and happiness predictions, which in turn was associated with stronger travel intentions and purchasing decisions. However, VR effects on consumer choice were moderated by previous experience with the destination. © 2021 The Authors",Skard S.; Knudsen E.S.; Sjåstad H.; Thorbjørnsen H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104360,Affective forecasting; Behavioral intentions; Mental imagery; Purchase; Telepresence; Virtual reality,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses how virtual reality impacts consumer behavior in tourism marketing, particularly focusing on decision-making processes related to travel intentions and purchasing decisions.

"Trajectories of attention capture the accumulation of brand utility during complex decision-making tasks. Thus, attention trajectories, as reflected in eye movements, predict the final brand choice of 85% of consumers before they implement it. Even when observing eye movements in only the first quarter of the decision process, attention already predicts brand choice much better (45%) than chance levels (20%). This superior prediction performance is due to a “double attention lift” for the chosen brand: The chosen brand receives progressively more attention toward the moment of choice, and more of this attention is devoted to integrating information about the brand rather than to comparing it with other options. In contrast, the currently owned brand grabs attention early in the task, and its attention gain persists for brand-loyal consumers and shifts for brand-switching consumers. A new attention and choice model used in tandem with the Bayesian K-fold cross-validation methodology on eye-tracking data from 325 representative consumers uncovered these attention trajectory effects. The findings contribute to closing important knowledge gaps in the attention and choice literature and have implications for marketing research and managerial practice. © The Author(s) 2023.",Martinovici A.; Pieters R.; Erdem T.,Tactical,10.1177/00222437221141052,attention and brand choice; Bayesian estimation; eye movements; K-fold cross-validation; prediction; utility accumulation,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses attention trajectories and their predictive power regarding brand choice, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing where strategies are shaped into specific actions like targeting and consumer engagement.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Attention Trajectories Capture Utility Accumulation and Predict Brand Choice,2023

"Objective: This study analyzes, through a systematic literature review, the main approaches used in research on consumer behavior that used eye-tracking as an identifier of physiological reactions. Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to identify and select empirical studies published in the last five years, between 2019 and 2023, in nine research databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, Emerald, Wiley Online, Sage, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar). Thus, 243 studies were included in the review. Results: The analyzed studies are mainly classified into four different themes of neuromarketing application: purchase decision, behavioral prediction, advertising effects, and customer retention. The main segments analyzed were e-commerce and retail. The predominance of quantitative studies and the need to control sociodemographic variables in the models is highlighted. In summary, there is a suggested need for more multimethod approaches that combine eye-tracking with quantitative and qualitative methods (retrospective interviews), as well as integrate it with other techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), facial biometrics, among others. Theoretical/Methodological Contributions: This research advances the understanding of the state of the art on eye-tracking and its application in neuromarketing, providing insights into methodological pathways. Originality/Relevance: Therefore, the main applications and emerging themes that can be explored in future studies are discussed.

"The accurate prediction of future retail sales is crucial in business. Marketing persistence modeling is a well-established framework for the analysis of retail sales dynamics using a time series approach. However, dominant academic approaches to persistence modeling are rather complex, requiring sophisticated analytic and computing skills. We introduce a decision making approach that allows jointly testing and predicting the evolution of retail sales using a state-space model. We first propose a model, which incorporates the foundations of persistence modeling, and provide a simple estimation method. Secondly, we show a formal procedure for detecting persistence and, hence, selecting parameters to predict future data. An empirical investigation carried out over nearly 30000 Walmart retail sales, shows that our model provides significantly better prediction performance when compared to standard benchmarks. The combination of simplicity and efficiency makes our approach appealing not only for scholars but also for practitioners. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Sbrana G.; Antonetti P.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114103,Marketing persistence; Model confident set; Prediction accuracy; State-space models,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract describes a method for predicting retail sales using a state-space model, which relates to marketing analytics and sales prediction.

"Evidence from psychology and marketing suggests that those who make a “precise” first offer in bargaining get a better deal than those who make a “round” first offer. We report on a series of experiments designed to test for and improve our understanding of the “precise first offer” (PFO) effect in bargaining and whether it likely reflects rational optimizing or equilibrium behavior. Our experiment varies whether decisions are incentivized and whether the PFO effect can emerge as an equilibrium of a cheap-talk signaling game. We find evidence of a PFO effect when subjects read a vignette and make unincentivized individual decisions. When monetary incentives are added to the vignette, we still find the PFO effect, but it is not robust. In a bilateral bargaining situation with a cheap-talk equilibrium, we can not find the PFO effect, which is inconsistent with the equilibrium predictions. Moreover, the PFO effect reemerges in a setting in which initial offers are generated by a random device and thus provides a strong refutation of the signaling model. Our evidence suggests that optimizing and equilibrium accounts of the PFO effect are inadequate. Understanding initial offers as reference points, which subtly change perceptions about the kinds of acceptable counteroffers, provides a plausible account of a new finding on which prior explanations are silent: precise offers induce more precise counteroffers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Kimbrough E.O.; Porter D.; Schneider M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.joep.2021.102406,Bargaining; Precise first offers; Reference points,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the precise first offer (PFO) effect in bargaining, which relates to decision-making processes that influence outcomes in negotiations and marketing contexts.

"Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling underpins modern marketing analytics, enabling the development of tailored customer relationship management strategies based on the predicted future value of their customers. As part of Amperity’s enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing ”out of the box”. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns.

"Purpose: Heightened public concerns for the global environment due to human overexploitation have given rise to many green product initiatives by businesses. Green cosmetics (GC) are products developed and marketed based on ecological sustainability and have shown increasing consumer appeal worldwide. The current research investigates the antecedents of green cosmetics consumption among Indian GC users, hitherto un-investigated comprehensively. Design/methodology/approach: The study is a cross-sectional pairwise comparison of green evaluation criteria for cosmetics using an expert panel of thirty Indian cosmetic users using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) and investigate the impact of a comprehensive list of antecedents on the multi-criteria category consumption decision. Findings: The study results indicate that perceived consumer effectiveness is the most critical factor for green cosmetics consumption in India, followed by brand trust, behavioural control, and environmental effectiveness. The least important factors are price and social norms. Research limitations/implications: As the GC category is at nascent stage in India the investigation is limited to the GC category innovators – a set of people high in intellectual and financial resources. The study is also limited to women users as the male cosmetic market in the country is still very small. Practical implications: The study results can help marketers in designing and implementing GC related marketing strategies to deliver higher customer value to the target segment. Academicians can use the study results for better prediction of category related behaviour of consumers. Social implications: The study results will help promote GC category adoption and usage which can benefit the environment and consumer health. Originality/value: The study contributes to literature and practice by assessing a comprehensive set of critical antecedents to GC adoption using a novel approach of F-AHP and an expert user panel. The study results offer insights to marketers that can be used to develop suitable strategies to convert non-GC users into GCs in India and similar markets, improving category penetration and benefitting marketers, retailers, users, and the environment. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Srivastava R.; Sanjeev M.A.; Gupta S.,Tactical,10.1108/IJRDM-09-2022-0340,Antecedents; Behavioral control; Brand trust; Consumer effectiveness; Environmental effectiveness; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Green cosmetics,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study investigates specific factors influencing consumer behavior towards green cosmetics in India, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into actionable marketing strategies.",scopus-prediction,20,60,A fuzzy approach to determining antecedents to green cosmetic consumption in India,2024
"This article presents a study using ResNet-50, GRU, and transfer learning to construct a marketing decision-making model and predict consumer behavior. Deep learning algorithms address the scale and complexity of consumer data in the information age. Traditional methods may not capture patterns effectively, while deep learning excels at extracting features from large datasets. The research aims to leverage deep learning to build a marketing decision-making model and predict consumer behavior. ResNet-50 analyzes consumer data, extracting visual features for marketing decisions. GRU model temporal dynamics, capturing elements like purchase sequences. Transfer learning improves performance with limited data by using pre-trained models. By comparing the model predictions with ground truth data, the performance of the models can be assessed and their effectiveness in capturing consumer behavior and making accurate predictions can be measured.

"Purpose: This research investigates the novel questions of whether and how specific forms of shopping channels (online vs offline) influence consumers' decision-making. Moreover, this research investigates marketing firms' proper marketing strategies across different shipping channels. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted three studies using a large sample (N = 703) recruited from a diverse pool (students and adults) that examined multiple products (camera and car) across different shopping channels (online vs offline). Study 1a (n = 251) and Study 1b (n = 252) examined the effect of an online versus offline channel on consumers' decision-making using a one-factor (shopping channel: online vs offline) between-subjects design. Meanwhile, Study 2 (n = 200) investigated the effective strategies that firms should employ across different shopping channels using a 2 (shopping channel: online vs offline) × 2 (mental simulation: outcome vs process) between-subjects design. Participants in the online condition evaluated the product on a computer screen, whereas participants in the offline condition evaluated the real product assuming a real-world retail store setting. Findings: The three studies supported the predictions that shopping channels (online vs offline) affect consumers' psychological distance and, in turn, affect their decision process. Specifically, results reveal that the online (offline) channel increases (decreases) psychological distance and leads consumers to pay more attention to a product's desirability (feasibility) aspects.

"Purpose: This study aims to identify a new model of relative customer satisfaction translated into share of purchases (SOP) with the best-related metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an online customer satisfaction survey to clients of a firm and with a comparative valuation with current competitors by customer. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis, obtaining β for each variable by relating the variables to the SOP, presenting the relative effect of the variables and the best global explanation of the model. Findings: This new model has good prediction accuracy and shows a clear impact of different relative satisfaction indicators and, to a minor degree, business and relationship characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this model is that it is based on data from only one company, but it should have value in other sectors and provide full insight through its transversal application. Originality/value: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers and determined how the improvements in customer satisfaction translate into business growth. The study shows that the relative evaluation of satisfaction carries different meanings for customers, while all of them are better than absolute satisfaction. It includes a more understandable indicator than other prior relative indicators, the difference in satisfaction and is more effective.

"Purpose: This paper aims to elucidate some of the complexity around food consumption by drawing from neuroscience research of food as a motivated choice (i.e. a neurobehavioral process sensitive to dopaminergic response to food and environmental cues such as marketing). The authors explore the single and compounded effect of the motivational salience of food’s intrinsic reinforcing value tied to its sugar content and that of two marketing food cues, price and in-store display, on actual consumer purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above hypotheses in two perceived “healthy” product categories with a wide distribution of sugar content. The authors estimate a within-category model using three years of retail transaction data to test the effect on weekly sales. Findings: The authors confirm the single effect of each of food’s and marketing cues’ motivational salience as well as their compounded effect with high-motivational-salience food being less price elastic and more susceptible to in-store display activities. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the need to complement current reliance on unhealthy/healthy perception with finer grained objective evidence linked to the formulation of the food itself and the marketing applied to them. Practical implications: The present study findings may help marketing managers and policymakers develop better targeted pricing and display strategies for low- and high-motivational-salience food, attempting to strike a better balance between consumer welfare and commercial performance.

"Purpose: This paper aims to examine how consumers make choices when they are faced with a fixed set of available options, consisting of both preferred and less-preferred choices, in the domain of food consumption. Specifically, the paper offers a novel perspective to predict repeated choice decisions in food consumption, which is termed as “pattern-seeking” – a consumption choice pattern that involves a coherent repetitive sequence of sub-groupings or coherently concentrated sub-groupings of options. Design/methodology/approach: Eight experimental studies that contrast the existing theoretical predictions regarding repeated choices (e.g. primacy effect, recency effect, variety vs consistency) against pattern-seeking were conducted using hypothetical and actual food choices. Findings: The results of experimental studies show that an explicit decision pattern (i.e. pattern-seeking) emerges as the most significant predictor of repeated choice in the food consumption domain. Research limitations/implications: This study offers a novel perspective on how consumers make repeated choices in the domain of food consumption. Practical implications: The results show that consumers prefer food consumption with a pattern (vs non-pattern). Thus, it would be better to generate marketing activities that allow customers to satisfy their pattern-seeking more easily.

"Facing the challenge of attracting consumers and winning market share under the proliferation of TV stations and channels, the traditional TV stations often make some marketing strategies. However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies.

"When preferences are sensitive to context, firms may influence purchase decisions by designing the environment of consumption choices. This paper studies how competitive retailers optimally design their product line if preferences at the store depend on whether the choice set draws consumer attention to the quality or price of a product. Before making a purchase decision, a consumer chooses among retailers without (fully) anticipating that her preferences at the store are malleable. We show that this setup can align evidence on retailer marketing practices and the existence of loss leaders with the experimental literature on decoy effects: in equilibrium, retailers use loss leaders to attract the consumer to the store and decoy products to draw consumer attention at the store to more profitable alternatives featuring a higher price (inducing a profitable upsell) or lower production cost (inducing a profitable downsell). We embed and compare the predictions of three recent specifications of choice-set dependent attention - namely, Salience, Focusing, and Relative Thinking. All three specifications predict that firms construct choice environments that utilize decoy effects to up- or downsell the consumer. Because they differ in how attention can be directed using the product line, however, they differ in their predictions of how the decoy will be positioned in the price-quality space.  © 2020 INFORMS.",Apffelstaedt A.; Mechtenberg L.,Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3675,Context; Decoys; Downselling; Focusing; Naïveté; Relative thinking; Retailer competition; Salience; Upselling,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses how retailers can design product lines and marketing strategies to influence consumer choices, which falls within the tactical level of decision-making.

"Purpose: Cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns have become common features of the marketplace. CRM often involves a for-profit business agreeing to contribute a specified amount to a cause when the business’s customers engage in revenue-generating exchanges. Despite the central role that price is likely to play in a consumer’s decision to purchase or not to purchase an offer associated with a CRM campaign, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, very few have examined price framing effects in a CRM context. This paper aims to explore the effect of rightmost digits manipulation in prices on participation intentions for CRM campaigns. Design/methodology/approach: In Study 1, 241 college students participated in an online experiment for class credit. The experiment used a 3 (price level: low, medium and high) × 2 (price ending: 99 ending and no ending) between-subjects design. The dependent variable was participation intention, and several moderators and mediators were considered. PROCESS was used to test the moderated mediation. In Study 2, 351 subjects participated in an online experiment with a design similar to the earlier study. In Study 2, however, new mediators were added and the moderated mediation was tested using SPSS PROCESS macro. Findings: This research shows that price ending impacts the effectiveness of CRM as a tactic on consumers’ purchase intentions. Consistent with the authors’ prediction, this study shows that consumers exposed to a 99-ending CRM offer are more likely to participate in the offer compared to consumers exposed to a no-ending priced offer. Offer attractiveness, elaboration and corporate social responsibility were also shown to have a strong effect on participation intentions. Practical implications: This research indicates that for moderately priced products, 99-ending prices led to an increased influence on consumer purchase intentions; on the other hand, no-ending/even-ending prices were more effective for high-priced products. Thus, the use of the right digit effect by managers in a CRM context as way of increasing consumers’ participation likelihood is likely to be more successful for moderately priced offers. Originality/value: This research extends previous work on CRM and right digit effect in pricing. This study’s findings, in both Studies 1 and 2, demonstrate that the effectiveness of CRM campaigns on consumer choice is dependent on the offer price ending. Consumers exposed to the no-ending priced CRM offers tend to be affected less by CRM campaigns compared to consumers exposed to 99-ending offers, who perceive the offer as more attractive. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Jaber M.; Jaber K.,Tactical,10.1108/JCM-12-2018-2993,99 ending; Cause-related marketing; Framing; Pricing; Right digit effect,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,The abstract discusses the manipulation of price endings in cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns and their direct impact on consumer participation intentions.

"Competitive markets and customers' changing needs in the bank industry necessitate accurately predicting customers who may leave the firm in the near future. Consequently, creating an approach to predict precisely and identify churn-leading causes is a part of retention strategies in customer relationship management. The approach that has been utilized in this research to predict customer churn combines decision tree (DT) and multinomial regression (MR) to classify customers with no limitation of binary classification in the churn prediction context. A customer club dataset of a commercial bank case as a real churn problem is used in this study to benchmark the hybrid forecasting approach against its building blocks. The results showed that the hybrid forecasting approach outperformed DT and MR with an average accuracy of 87.66%, 90.74% micro-average, and 90.44% macro-average of AUC. Further analysis of the model performance per class indicated that the hybrid approach's misclassification error for the churn class decreased significantly, which is the most costly error in churn problems. Moreover, due to the structure of hybrid forecasting approach, more interoperability is obtained by assessing the impact of features in different segments, resulting in transforming them into actionable insights. The proposed approach is applied to the banking industry to prevent financial loss by detecting leading churn causes. Accordingly, after predicting the risk of customer churn, marketers and managers can determine appropriate actions that will have the most significant retention impact on each customer by applying proactive retention marketing. © World Scientific Publishing Co.",Rouhani S.; Mohammadi A.,Tactical,10.1142/S0219649222500897,banking industry; Churn prediction; Customer Churn; decision tree; hybrid approach,5.0,,15,0,World Scientific,"The abstract discusses a specific approach to predict customer churn, which involves structured decision-making and analysis to optimize marketing efforts.

"With the broad reach of the Internet, online users frequently resort to various word-of-mouth (WOM) sources, such as online user reviews and professional reviews, during online decision making. Although prior studies generally agree on the importance of online WOM, we have little knowledge of the interplay between online user reviews and professional reviews. This paper empirically investigates a mediation model in which online user reviews mediate the impact of professional reviews on online user decisions. Using software download data, we show that a higher professional rating not only directly promotes software download but also results in more active user-generated WOM interactions, which indirectly lead to more downloads. The indirect impact of professional reviews can be as large as 20 percent of the corresponding total impact. These findings deepen our understanding of online WOM effect, and provide managerial suggestions about WOM marketing and the prediction of online user choices.

"Purpose: Grocery retailers have access to detailed data on consumer purchases within their own chains. Previous research has used across-chain scanner panel data to develop optimal price cuts targeted to individual households but whether such a targeting strategy will work with only within-chain data is unknown. The purpose of this research is to address this specific question. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use scanner panel data from multiple categories to create across-chain and within-chain purchase histories for the same consumers. They then estimate models of purchase decisions on the two datasets and compare their performance. Findings: Within-chain data fares significantly worse on both fit and prediction criteria. Retailers' upside to customizing is minimal compared to those reported for manufacturers. Finally, customized prices based on the within-chain model significantly underperform the promise of across-chain data. Research limitations/implications: Store choice is not modelled. Research also needs to be replicated in other contexts. The authors conclude that limited purchase histories may not yield accurate enough estimates of marketing mix responsiveness, and that across-chain purchase histories are essential for effective targeted price cuts. Practical implications: Loyalty card data may be useful for other purposes, like experimenting with segment-specific discounts, but its value in customizing prices at individual level is limited without adding other sources of information. Originality/value: Previous research on price customization has been based almost exclusively on across-store data. However, retailers only have access to their own chain-specific data. This is the first study to comprehensively compare price customization based on within- and across-chain purchase data and show that the upside potential for price customization based on the former information set is quite limited. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Niraj R.; Siddarth S.,Tactical,10.1108/EJM-01-2012-0032,and quantity models; choice; Incidence; Loyalty cards; Retailing; Scanner panel data; Targeted price cuts,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The research focuses on the effectiveness of pricing strategies based on consumer purchase data, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The rate of adoption of digital terrestrial television in Denmark was 100 per cent. In this article, an interdisciplinary approach is utilized to investigate this successful rate of adoption. Diffusion of innovation theory as well as services marketing theory and recent research on adoption of technology are integrated into the theoretical approach. The data gathering is twofold: a survey on the perceived attributes of the innovation was carried out and document data were gathered from government sources. This study shows that a 100 per cent rate of adoption can be achieved with (1) negative perception of the attributes of the innovation; (2) an authority innovation-decision; (3) use of mass communication and interpersonal communication channels; (4) communication in social networks that are not interconnected; and (5) active change agents on a comprehensive and large scale.

"Poor people often exhibit puzzlingly high sensitivity to low prices of important consumer health goods. This paper proposes decision costs as one explanation: whether a person buys at a price depends on whether she carefully considers the offer, which itself depends on price. A simple model predicts that deliberation costs (1) increase sensitivity to low prices; (2) can prevent cost-sharing from targeting products to buyers with high value; and (3) can have larger effects on poorer people. The principal contribution of this paper is a field experiment that sold hand-washing soap in rural India. Participants were randomly assigned to be offered soap for either a low or very low price, which was experimentally crossed with assignment to a control group or to a treatment that required deliberation. Results matched predictions of the model: the treatment decreased price sensitivity relative to the control group, and increased targeting of product take-up by need. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Spears D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jebo.2013.06.012,Behavioral economics; Cognitive limits; Cost sharing; Deliberation costs; Development economics; Field experiment; Handwashing with soap; Pricing; Social marketing,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses decision costs and price sensitivity in consumer behavior, particularly in the context of a field experiment targeting soap sales in rural India.

"Although the transaction cost analysis (TCA) has long been used by marketing and management scholars to study organizational buyers' make-or-buy decisions, it sheds limited light on their choice behavior beyond the make-or-buy trade-off. In the meantime, many organizational purchase decisions are structured around which independent supplier to buy from, rather than a typical make-or-buy decision. This study extends existing research on TCA by applying this theoretical framework to explore why organizational buyers make purchases from among independent suppliers. The article posits that (1) two forms of relationship governance—buyer trust and market (i.e., the relative dependence between the buyer and supplier)—help explain the differences in buyer decision-making uncertainty involving independent suppliers, which further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase; and that (2) trust further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase due to its effect on customer perceived value. The empirical study based on organizational purchasing decisions lends support to the predictions of the relationship governance theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Gao T.,Tactical,10.1080/15332667.2017.1357522,business-to-business marketing; decision-making uncertainty; organizational buyers; outsourcing; perceived value; relationship governance; supplier selection,5.0,,20,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses organizational buyers' decision-making regarding purchasing from independent suppliers, focusing on relationship governance factors like trust and market dependence, which fits within tactical decision-making related to specific purchasing behaviors.",scopus-prediction,10,60,A Relationship Governance Perspective of Organizational Buyers' Supplier Choice Decisions,2017
"Managing marketing resources over time requires dynamic model estimation, which necessitates specifying some parametric or nonparametric probability distribution. When the data generating process differs from the assumed distribution, the resulting model is misspecified. To hedge against such a misspecification risk, the extant theory recommends using the sandwich estimator. This approach, however, only corrects the variance of estimated parameters, but not their values. Consequently, the sandwich estimator does not affect any managerial outcomes such as marketing budgeting and allocation decisions. To overcome this drawback, we present the minimax framework that does not necessitate distributional assumptions to estimate dynamic models. Applying minimax control theory, we derive an optimal robust filter, illustrate its application to a unique advertising data set from the Canadian Blood Services, and contribute several novel findings. We discover the compensatory effect: Advertising effectiveness increases and the carryover effect decreases as robustness increases. We also find that the robust filter uniformly outperforms the Kalman filter on the out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we uncover the existence of a profit-volatility trade-off, similar to the returns-risk trade-off in finance, whereby the volatility of profit stream decreases at the expense of reduced total profit as robustness increases. Finally, we prove that, unlike for-profit companies, managers of nonprofit organizations should optimally allocate budgets opposite the advertising-to-sales ratio heuristic; that is, advertise more (less) when sales are low (high). © 2017 INFORMS.",Rubel O.; Naik P.A.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.1010,Dynamic games; Kalman filter; Nonprofit marketing; Optimal control; Robust estimation; Sandwich estimator,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses methods for estimating dynamic marketing models and provides insights on advertising effectiveness and budget allocation, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing analytics and campaign optimization.",scopus-prediction,15,70,Robust dynamic estimation,2017
"This study uses data from a special subsample of the National Agricultural, Food, and Public Policy Preference Survey to assess use of weather data for agricultural decision making. Responses from 284 Arizona farmers and ranchers were used to examine (i) the importance producers placed on different types of weather data for production and marketing decisions; (ii) which producer characteristics accounted for differences in the importance they placed on weather data; (iii) producer use of weather data for specific production and marketing decisions; and (iv) which factors distinguish weather data users from nonusers.Amodel of demand for weather information was developed and used to specify count data and discrete choice multivariate regression models. The intensity of weather data use was greater among producers with diversified agricultural production. Diversified producers were more likely to use data for timing of planting, cultivation, and harvest. Weather data use was lower among producers with greater reliance on off-farm income. Producers who rated government risk-management programs as important also found more weather data types important and used weather data for more decisions.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is threefold: first is to study and analyse the personal beliefs of the customers regarding their generic assessments for the main issues of today: environment, culture or equal opportunities for everyone. Second, it will attempt to compare the differing opinions different customers from several countries possess. Finally, it is to relate, link and model the influence these opinions may have on the country selection made by the tourist. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is drawn from a sample of approximately 1,600 customers/tourists who visited Crete island. Those in the sample were from ten different countries of origin. The research attempts to shed some light on the importance of travellers' beliefs by using the multinomial logistic model that tested whether it can produce results for prediction and comparisons. Findings – Results suggest that tourist beliefs can be categorized in three factors, namely country's characteristics, tradition and hygiene that are differentiated among nationality groups. No robust support is provided for any relationship between travellers' values and country selection and thus arguing for further research in tourism marketing and policy. Practical implications – By using the findings of this work, hotel managers and tour operators can identify the multicultural diversity of international tourists. Originality/value – This work addresses the ways with which customers by using their personal beliefs select destinations (countries). It diverts from the mainstream relevant literature that focuses almost solely on the level of satisfaction or the level of service the customer enjoys.

"The problem argued in the literature of direct mailing decisions generally contains three parts: 1) forecasting customers' future purchase/non-purchase responses; 2) evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for increasing customers purchase responses; 3) prioritising the customers in terms of their values.

"For marketers, consumers’ increasing use of online reviews in arriving at purchase decisions is a double edged sword. On one hand, it presents opportunity for manufacturers and sellers to be highlighted for their good work, but at the same time, there remains a possibility of negative review impacting goodwill and reputation. Hence, it is important for managers to identify factors that impact consumers’ intentions to write online reviews. This research delves into this aspect by trying to identify the factors that impact reviews writing intentions of consumers for restaurants. The study extends the theory of planned behaviour with additions of variables such as ego involvement, taking vengeance and helping a restaurant. For this, 252 valid responses were obtained, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model.

"The tendency of bias identification and quantification with the goal of better estimation and prediction, grows. The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer’s personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers’ communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents. Theoretical implications of the findings request questioning the use of the personality traits as an interim stage in decision-making predictions.

"Capturing the sentiments and the emotional states enclosed in textual information is a critical task which embraces a wide range of web-oriented activities such as detecting the sentiments associated to the product reviews, developing marketing programs that would be attractive for users, enhancing customer service with respect to its expectation until to identifying new opportunities and financial market prediction, besides managing reputations. Opinions and the emotions that are embedded in them, play a key role in decision-making processes, with different effects depending on the negative or positive valence of the mood. When the choice depends on some important features (i.e., time, money, reliability/efficacy, etc.) and on other opinions (which come from previous experience), could be crucial to make the best decision. Inferring opinions and emotions enclosed in the written language is a complex task which cannot rely on body languages (posture, gestures, vocal inflections), rather than discovering concepts with an affective valence. The role of opinions extracted by the social content is crucial to support consumers' decision process; in addition, thanks opinions and emotions, it is possible to evidence improvements on existing decision supports and show how the opinion-mining techniques can be incorporated into these systems. This paper presents a tentative contribution that addresses this issue: it introduces a framework for extracting the emotions and the sentiments expressed in the textual data. The sentiments are expressed by a positive or negative polarity, the emotions are based on the Minsky's conception of emotions, that consists of four affective dimensions, each one with six levels of activations [1]. Sentiments and emotions are modeled as fuzzy sets; particularly, the intensity of the emotions has been tuned by fuzzy modifiers, which act on the linguistic patterns recognized in the sentences. The approach has been tested on some sets of documents categories, revealing interesting performance on the global framework processing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA) has been used for predicting cluster membership of decision-making units (DMUs). One of the possible applications of DEA-DA is in the marketing research area. This paper uses cluster analysis to cluster customers into two clusters: Gold and Lead. Then, to predict cluster membership of new customers, DEA-DA is applied. In DEA-DA, an arbitrary parameter imposing a small gap between two clusters (η) is incorporated. It is shown that different η leads to different prediction accuracy levels since an unsuitable value for η leads to an incorrect classification of DMUs. We show that even the data set with no overlap between two clusters can be misclassified. This paper proposes a new DEA-DA model to tackle this issue. The aim of this paper is to illustrate some computational difficulties in previous DEA-DA approaches and then to propose a new DEA-DA model to overcome the difficulties.

"This paper builds an inter-organizational Stackelberg game model of trade credit. The incentive-compatible decision on credit term is made endogenously and in coordination to ensure Pareto optimality for both the supplier and the retailer. Our model factors in financing, marketing, operations, default risk, and risk attitude coherently, treating trade credit as their intersectional nexus. We introduce the uncertainty due to the possible default of the retailer on the accounts payable into our model. The in-kind nature of trade credit is in line with the two-stage lottery method employed in this paper to capture the consequences of default on trade credit effectively. We find that financing capacity encourages the supplier to extend the credit term: a larger market demand rate prompts the supplier to extend a longer credit term, but a higher holding cost for the retailer shortens the length of the credit term received. More risk-averse suppliers tend to grant shorter term, but the impact of risk attitude is insignificant. Empirically, we find evidence supporting our main theoretical predictions by employing a panel sample of manufacturing companies covering 1998–2007 from the COMPUSTAT database. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Shi X.; Zhang S.,Tactical,10.1007/s11846-013-0103-7,Bilevel programming; Default risk; Economic ordering quantity (EOQ); Trade credit; Two-stage lottery,5.0,,20,0,Springer Verlag,"The paper focuses on decision-making processes around trade credit terms in a structured manner, indicating a tactical approach to optimize outcomes for suppliers and retailers within the constraints of risk and market conditions.",scopus-prediction,15,60,"Trade credit: the interaction of financing, marketing, operations, and risk behavior",2014
"Remote sensing techniques using vegetation indices (VI's) have successfully enabled the accurate and timely monitoring of several crops. The purpose of this monitoring is to provide an advantage in terms of on-farm management decision making, crop marketing planning, and support for policy decision-making. We identified here which VI's can be used to predict soybean grain yield (GY) by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and remote multispectral sensor. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in three sites during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons in Brazil. The VI's were measured together with the plant stand assessment at 25 days after emergency (DAE) when the plants were at V4 phenological stage. The processing of the VI models was performed based on the imaging reflectance factor data performed in the field. For statistical data analyses, a correlation network was used to express the relationship between GY and VI's graphically. Path analysis was performed for identifying the cause-and-effect relationship between VI's and GY. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm was generated considering GY as a dependent variable. At last, the relative deviation coefficient was used to illustrate the differences between the VI's in the construction of the decision tree and GY. Our results showed potential for predicting soybean yield based on UAV and the multispectral sensor coupled. SAVI and NDVI indices stood out for predicting yield, where the regions with the highest values of these indices can obtain the highest yield observed in the field, providing an advantage in management at the property level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",da Silva E.E.; Rojo Baio F.H.; Ribeiro Teodoro L.P.; da Silva Junior C.A.; Borges R.S.; Teodoro P.E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100318,Decision tree; Glycine max; Path analysis; Precision agriculture; Spatial variability,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the use of vegetation indices (VIs) to predict soybean grain yield, which represents a tactical decision-making process.

"Nowadays, in order to succeed in business and presence in the world markets, it is essential to outperform the competitors to get bigger market share. To get customers satisfaction of products is the first stage of success in business. Studying the different factors involved in increasing the level of customer's satisfaction and researching in this field has caused development in several companies. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a fuzzy inference system (FIS) are designed for marketing mix model. By using the P4 principle (price, product, place, promotion) and by combining it with the marketing experts' knowledge, good results were achieved using ANFIS. This system as an advisor with high accuracy can reduce the human errors and play a significant role in decision making by corporate managers. The results of two systems were compared and it was seen that ANFIS had a better performance than FIS with mean accuracies of 98.6% and 87.25%, respectively. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Co.",Neshat M.; Pourahmad A.A.; Hasani M.R.,Tactical,10.1142/S0219649216500374,adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy decision; fuzzy expert system; marketing model,5.0,,15,0,World Scientific Publishing Co.

"The purchasing process consists of multiple, non-isolated phases that describe the interactions between consumers and products. One of these phases is the evaluation of alternatives, in which the consumer compares the benefits that will be obtained from each product or service depending on a set of criteria. Recently, the rise of online ecosystems has fueled the development of new purchasing-decision prediction models (PDPM) based on the shared opinions, concerns, and expectations of customers. Commonly, these PDPMs are constructed as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, where experts ascertain the consumer's purchasing criteria, as well as the importance of them, by means of surveys and their own experience. Although relying on experts may be appropriate for identifying criteria, this approach is not suitable for assessing the importance of said criteria due to the large volume of information available on the Web. Furthermore, the preferences of consumers in online ecosystems evolve constantly. In this regard, we consider that the information about purchase-criteria importance should be derived exclusively from the opinions of consumers. However, the attitude and thought-process leading to purchases contain inherent relationships that consumers are not able to express explicitly; consequently, we explore the possibility to make use of the synergies between criteria along user preferences. This paper proposes a new PDPM that estimates the importance of the criteria and values the alternatives by only considering the opinions expressed by consumers in digital ecosystems, while using an expert-defined set of criteria. The proposed approach extracts the weights of both criteria and alternatives and determines the implicit synergies within them without the need of additional input. Lastly, it uses the Choquet integral for weight and valuation aggregation and determines a purchase ranking. This model has been tested in real examples, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2018",Peláez J.I.; Cabrera F.E.; Vargas L.G.,Tactical,10.1016/j.knosys.2018.07.023,Aggregation operators; Choquet integral; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Synergy criteria,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a purchasing-decision prediction model (PDPM) that focuses on evaluating alternatives based on consumer opinions and criteria.

"Although many researchers in information systems and marketing have studied the effect of product reviews on sales, few have looked at their effect on product returns. We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.",Sahoo N.; Dellarocas C.; Srinivasan S.,Tactical,10.1287/isre.2017.0736,Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the impact of product reviews on purchase and return behaviors, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing analytics, customer acquisition, and purchase prediction.

"This paper examines the feasibility of extracting useful information from customer comments using a Naïve Bayes classifier. This was done for a database, obtained from a large Korean mobile telephone service provider, of 533 customer calls to call centers in 2009. After eliminating calls not containing customer complaints or comments, the remaining 383 comments were classified by an expert panel into four domains and 27 complaint categories. The four domains were Transaction-related (189 comments, 49%), Product-related (120 comments, 31%), Customer Service or Support-related (38 comments, 10%) and Customer Outreach and Marketing-related (36 comments, 9%). The comments were then randomly assigned to either a training set (257 cases, 67%) or test set (126 cases, 33%). The training set was used to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier that correctly predicted the domain 75% of the time and the specific subcategory 51% of the time for the test set. Prediction accuracy was strongly related to prediction strength for both sets of predictions, suggesting that simple filtering strategies where difficult to understand comments are flagged for expert review and easy comments are automatically classified are both technically feasible and likely to be practically valuable. Several strong predictors were also identified that corresponded to categories more detailed than those originally assigned. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.",Choe P.; Lehto M.R.; Shin G.-C.; Choi K.-Y.,Tactical,10.1002/hfm.20325,Bayesian inference; Call center agent; Customer complaints; Decision support; TextMiner,5.0,,15,0,,"The paper discusses the application of a Naïve Bayes classifier to analyze customer comments, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into specific targets such as improving customer service by automating the classification of complaints.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Semiautomated identification and classification of customer complaints,2013
"This study focuses on the field of citrus markets in the Lattakia region, the Syrian Arab Republic. Despite the high impact of citrus production on the livelihood of more than 40,000 families in the region, citrus farmers are not informed about expected prices and market trends. This information is crucial to making successful business decisions. The main aim of the paper is the assessment of Lattakia market price dynamics and to verify the use of regression and OLS models as tools of an Agricultural Marketing Information System (AMIS) for citrus price forecasting in the Lattakia region. To this end, five indicators were applied to the data set and two models for citrus wholesale price prediction on the Lattakia markets were tested in the paper. These indicators and models were applied to empirical data, obtained from an actual Marketing Information System in the Lattakia Region. The results showed high volatility in the prices between the markets and over different months and the regression model with an index of determination R² = 0.90 was identified as suitable for seasonal price predictions (short term forecasting), while the least square method was a good tool for annual price prediction (long term). © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

"Purpose: Social media is increasingly drawing the attention and interest of business-to-business (B to B) organizations. Yet, B to B organizations remain cautious in their social media pursuits, in part based on a stated lack of understanding for best practices. The purpose of the current work is to take initial steps to address this challenge by identifying specific social media message features that influence online users’ engagement with B to B organizations. Methodology/Approach: This work examines the Twitter feeds of the top 50 social B to B brands (as reported by Brandwatch in 2015) to examine the effects of message features (hashtags, text difficulty, embedded media, and message timing) on user engagement, captured in terms of Twitter likes and retweets. Findings: We argue that message features that enhance fluency (e.g., images) should enhance engagement. In contrast, those that disrupt fluency (e.g., hasthags) should result in lower levels of engagement. Consistent with these predictions, we find that hashtags and text difficulty correlate to lower levels of engagement whereas embedded media in the form of images and video correlate to higher levels of engagement. Also consistent with the proposed fluency framework, we find that tweets from B to B organizations generate greater engagement on evenings and weekends. Research Implications: This research applies a fluency lens to identify specific message features that influence online engagement. In doing so, it highlights fluency as a powerful construct for understanding the drivers of B to B social media brand engagement. More generally, this work suggests fluency as a valuable conceptual lens for developing effective B to B social media strategies. This research also speaks to the complexity of B to B social media strategies–organizations must go beyond content and platform decisions, to also consider the specific features of the message. Practical Implications: Social media is becoming more and more important to B to B organizations and is as yet an underutilized engagement tool. The current work offers initial strategies regarding message features that business practitioners can incorporate into their content development strategies to strengthen engagement. Specifically, efforts should be made to attain high levels of fluency in B to B social media content development. Originality/Value/Contribution of the Paper: The current work offers initial insights as to the importance of understanding not only how social media topics/content influence engagement, but also the influence of message features (e.g., hashtags, embedded media). In doing so, it highlights fluency as a novel conceptual lens for developing more effective B to B social media strategies.

"Common wisdom suggests that managerial empathy (i.e., the mental process of taking a consumer perspective) helps executives separate their personal consumption preferences from those of consumers, thereby preventing egocentric preference predictions. The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers' self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers' private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathie managers' self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions, the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity endorsement. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",Hattula J.D.; Herzog W.; Dahl D.W.; Reinecke S.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.13.0296,Consumer preference predictions; Managerial decision making; Managerial empathy; Managers' consumer identity; Responsiveness to market research,5.0,,20,5,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses managerial empathy and its effects on decision-making processes in marketing contexts such as product development and pricing.

"Motivated by Internet advertising applications, online allocation problems have been studied extensively in various adversarial and stochastic models. While the adversarial arrival models are too pessimistic, many of the stochastic (such as i.i.d. or random-order) arrival models do not realistically capture uncertainty in predictions. A significant cause for such uncertainty is the presence of unpredictable traffic spikes, often due to breaking news or similar events. To address this issue, a simultaneous approximation framework has been proposed to develop algorithms that work well both in the adversarial and stochastic models; however, this framework does not enable algorithms that make good use of partially accurate forecasts when making online decisions. In this article, we propose a robust online stochastic model that captures the nature of traffic spikes in online advertising. In our model, in addition to the stochastic input for which we have good forecasting, an unknown number of impressions arrive that are adversarially chosen. We design algorithms that combine a stochastic algorithm with an online algorithm that adaptively reacts to inaccurate predictions. We provide provable bounds for our new algorithms in this framework. We accompany our positive results with a set of hardness results showing that our algorithms are not far from optimal in this framework. As a byproduct of our results, we also present improved online algorithms for a slight variant of the simultaneous approximation framework. Copyright © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

"In the past, studies have investigated brand equity only in the ‘post-launch’ context, hence missing opportunities to make early corrections in cases of negative favourability. Using technology-enabled online community data, this study examines whether ‘pre-launch’ brand favourability can predict community's post-launch purchase decisions, by introducing a new construct called community-based brand equity (CoBBE). This study also investigates whether CoBBE can predict future sales of new products. Weekly data are collected for eight weeks before and after product launch from a movie-based online community for a period of 16 months. The results show that community-based variables such as pre-launch brand awareness level, brand favourability and brand strength have a significant influence on 1) community members' post-release purchase decisions both in the opening week as well as the entire lifetime of products, and 2) satisfaction level. The study also finds that CoBBE is a significant predictor of future market sales, thus showing the usefulness of CoBBE as an early warning diagnostic tool which will enable movie studios to gain early brand-related insights as well as to make early corrective actions when needed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Ponnamma Divakaran P.K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.techfore.2017.09.024,Brand awareness; Brand equity; Brand favourability; Online community; Sales prediction,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The study investigates pre-launch brand favourability and its impact on post-launch purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and purchase prediction.",scopus-prediction,20,60,Technology-enabled community data for gaining pre-release brand insights,2018
"The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Peloza J.; White K.; Shang J.,Tactical,10.1509/jm.11.0454,Environment; Ethical products; Green marketing; Self-accountability; Sustainability,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses how situational factors influence consumer preferences for ethical branding, which relates to tactical marketing decisions.

"Experience and socialization are key factors in customer commitment and defection decisions. To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109-126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate. This study's results indicate that the inclusion of social effects increases the predictive power of the customer churn model (Nitzan and Libai, Journal of Marketing 75(6):24-38, 2011), thus contributing to our understanding of the role social networks play in customer decisions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Giudicati G.; Riccaboni M.; Romiti A.,Tactical,10.1007/s11002-013-9233-6,Co-experience network; Co-presence data; Customer retention; Relational switching cost; Social networks,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on customer retention and the impact of social networks on customer decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions that aim to optimize customer engagement and reduce churn rates.",scopus-prediction,10,70,"Experience, socialization and customer retention: Lessons from the dance floor",2013
"Manufacturers increasingly integrate information and communication technologies into their products so that they can provide IT-based services.

"Forecasts are a basic input in the decision processes of operations management because they provide information on future demand and to increase revenue. The main purpose of this paper was to compare three different quantitative forecasting methods and develop a monthly short term sales forecasting model specifically on shoes of A-Shoe Company, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Twelve months (December 2013 - November 2014) sales data (of different types of pair of shoes) was collected from the company. From quantitative forecasting methods, a time-series model, that is, moving average, weighted moving average, and exponential smoothing were used to predict monthly sales forecast for the month of December 2014. Trend equation was formulated by using the least square regression method; analysis was done along with standard error of estimate. Prediction interval limits at 95% level of confidence were calculated. Exponential smoothing forecasting method (with alpha value 0.1) was found to be fit when comparing different mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE). The forecasted shoe sales value was found to be within the prediction interval limits. ANOVA results revealed that the calculated value of F (9.34) was less than the table value of F (10.04). Hence, the null hypothesis (b = 0) is accepted.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to detect different behavioral groups and the dominant patterns of customer shifts between segments of different values over time. Design/methodology/approach – A new hybrid methodology is presented based on clustering techniques and mining top-k and distinguishing sequential rules. This methodology is implemented on the data of 14,772 subscribers of a mobile phone operator in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The main data include the call detail records and event detail records data that was acquired from the IT department of this operator. Findings – Seven different behavioral groups of customer shifts were identified. These groups and the corresponding top-k rules represent the dominant patterns of customer behavior. The results also explain the relation of customer switching behavior and segment instability, which is an open problem. Practical implications – The findings can be helpful to improve marketing strategies and decision making and for prediction purposes. The obtained rules are relatively easy to interpret and use; this can strengthen the practicality of results. Originality/value – A new hybrid methodology is proposed that systematically extracts the dominant patterns of customer shifts.

"Domestic consumption of nutritional products and food supplements are on the rise. This is due to the fact that consumers have become more affluent and aware of their health. Edible bird's nest (EBN) is used as a health supplement for medicinal benefits to improve health quality. However, issues such as contamination and counterfeit EBN have caused fluctuation of the product's price over time and consumers are slowly shunning away from consuming EBN products. Marketing effort is a strategy tool often used to convince buying intention among consumers and therefore relieve the public's anxiety. Presently, the extent of marketing mix that can convince consumers' intention to purchase EBN products remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the influence of marketing mix towards consumers' intention to purchase EBN products. Principle component analysis and decision tree models were used to analyze the data. The performance of three decision tree models was compared based on accuracy and sensitivity rate. Result showed that all three models possessed similar accuracy rate (CART = 84.35%, C5.0 = 84.73%, QUEST = 83.08%), while C5.0 had the highest sensitivity (CART = 84.7%, C5.0 = 87.46%, QUEST = 85.59%). The important variables derived from C5.0 model are health conscious, gender, promotion, race, price, employment, and income.

"Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample. For managers and researchers alike, our criteria offer a verifiable explanation for differences in marketing elasticities and an actionable connection between marketing and financial performance metrics. © 2014 INFORMS.",Hanssens D.M.; Pauwels K.H.; Srinivasan S.; Vanhuele M.; Yildirim G.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2013.0841,Consumer attitude metrics; Cross-effects model; Dynamic programming model; Empirical generalizations; Hierarchical linear model; Optimal marketing resource allocation; Potential; Responsiveness; Sales conversion; Stickiness,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses specific criteria for connecting marketing actions with consumer attitudes and sales performance, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"In telecom sector, huge amount of data is generated on daily routine owing to extensive client base. Business analysts and decision makers highlighted that including new customers seems to be costly than that of maintaining prevailing customers. Customer relationship management (CRM) and Business analysts have to recognize the cause of churn customers and to validate behavioural patterns from prevailing churn customer‘s data. This work anticipated a churn prediction model that utilizes clustering and classification approaches to recognize churn customers and to give factors that resides behind customer churning in telecom sectors. Feature selection is carried out with association attribute ranking model and weighted oversampling technique. The proposed approach initially classifies churn customers data with Adaptive Logitboost (ALB) classification algorithm for classifying the instance more appropriately. Generation of retention policies is a significant process of relationship management to eliminate churners. After performing classification approach, these model segments customers‘ data by categorization using requirement similarity matrix to acquire information gain. This model validates churn factors that are needed for determining primary cause of churn. By recognizing essential churn factors from customer data, CRM may enhance productivity by recommending appropriate promotions to set of customers based on association among behavioural patterns. Thereby, marketing campaigns are improved for the company. The anticipated churn prediction model is computed with metrics like precision, accuracy, F-measure, recall and receiving operating characteristics (ROC) area. Results depict that anticipated churn prediction provides better classification with ALB and customer profiling with requirement similarity matrix. Moreover, it provides cause of customer churning through generation of related pattern association. © 2020 IJSTR.",Hemalatha M.; Mahalakshmi S.,Tactical,,Association rule; Behavioural pattern; Churn customer; Prediction model; Similarity matrix,0.0,,10,0,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,"The abstract focuses on the development of a churn prediction model using specific methodologies, such as clustering and classification, which are aimed at addressing customer retention strategies.

"While customer management has become a top priority for practitioners and academics, little is known about how managers actually make customer management decisions. Our study addresses this gap and uses the adaptive decision maker as well as the fast and frugal heuristics frameworks to gain a better understanding of managerial decision making. Using the process-tracing tool MouselabWEB, we presented sales managers in retail banking with three typical customer management prediction tasks. The results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a significant increase in accuracy. Hence, the existing skepticism concerning heuristics should be questioned. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.",Bauer J.C.; Schmitt P.; Morwitz V.G.; Winer R.S.,Tactical,10.1007/s11747-012-0320-7,Adaptive decision making; Customer management; Fast and frugal heuristics; Mouselab; Process-tracing,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on how sales managers make customer management decisions using analytical tools and heuristics, which aligns with structured decision-making at a tactical level.",scopus-prediction,10,70,"Managerial decision making in customer management: Adaptive, fast and frugal?",2013
"Different framing of the same duration (one year, 12 months, 365 days) can influence consumers' impressions of subjective duration, thereby affecting their judgments and decisions. The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Ülkümen G.; Thomas M.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.10.0172,Duration framing; Duration perception; Mental simulation; Personal relevance; Process simulation,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses how different framings of time can influence consumer behavior and decision-making, which aligns with tactical marketing efforts that focus on optimizing consumer engagement and decision processes.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Personal relevance and mental simulation amplify the duration framing effect,2013
"Purpose: Educational institutions are caught between increasing their offer rates and attracting and retaining those prospective students who are most suited to course completion. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the influence of demographic and psychological constructs on students’ preferences when choosing to study in a particular faculty through the application and testing of a student choice logit model based on data collected from a survey of existing students. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regression techniques were used to estimate the probability of undergraduate prospective students’ choices with reference to a set of variables that allows for the prediction and classification of students (n=304) at an Australian university. Using the estimated coefficients of both student characteristics and psychological variables, probability outputs were constructed to compute the faculty membership for student groups. Outputs were also illustrated via a set of simulation analyses. Findings: The results of the student choice logit model are highly significant suggesting demographic, socioeconomic and psychological variables play a role in the prediction of faculty membership of undergraduate students. Practical implications: These findings have implications for researchers, educational policy makers and career planners. The study also suggests that these policies should take into account the complexities of multi-attribute influences on students’ decision-making choices.

"Potential relation detecting on social network has become more important for decision making in many business disciplines, such as marketing, business strategy, human resources development, finance planning, business transformation, insurance policy design, and tourism management. People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for “word of mouth” advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms. © 2018",Chen L.; Gao M.; Li B.; Liu W.; Chen B.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2018.09.006,Link prediction; Matrix completion; Multi-relational social networks; Potential relations; Similarity,0.0,,15,5,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses methods for detecting potential social relations within multi-relational networks, which can inform decision-making in specific business disciplines.

"We develop a method to predict an optimal cutoff point from an ascending list of potential customer activation scores tomaximize profit in a future direct marketing campaign. The scoring model is based upon attributes available froma database. Our Bayesian predictive decision theoretic solution is based on two features: (1) a three-parameter bounded, asymmetric loss function BLINEX that has a higher penalty for failure to choose good prospects rather than including too many bad prospects; and (2) a Bayesian nonstandard t-predictive distribution for a future optimal score derived from normal-gamma likelihood function with unknown mean and variance based on data consisting of past optimal activation scores together with a four-parameter conjugate prior. The parameters of the BLINEX loss are also derived from past data. A comparison of BLINEX derived profits with those fromtraditional squared error loss is made via a fractional factorial experimental design with a half-normal analysis. It shows that our method is far superior based on predicted profit and that, of all parameters, the BLINEX asymmetry and prior mean are the most influential main effects. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Levy M.S.; Wen D.; Chakilam V.; Wang H.-Y.,Tactical,10.1080/01966324.2016.1173607,Bayesian decision theory; Bayesian prediction; BLINEX loss; Predictive inference; Scoring models,5.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract describes a method for predicting an optimal cutoff point for customer activation scores to maximize profit in a marketing campaign, which aligns with structured decision-making processes typical of tactical actions in marketing.",scopus-prediction,10,75,Revisiting optimal cutoff score determination in direct marketing using BLINEX loss: Bayesian decisive prediction approach,2016
"In a social network, adoption probability refers to the probability that a social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Naïve Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer limited predictive power and that confounding factors are critical to adoption probability predictions. © 2013 INFORMS.",Fang X.; Hu P.J.; Li Z.L.; Tsai W.,Tactical,10.1287/isre.1120.0461,Adoption probability; Bayesian learning; Confounding factor; Entity similarity; Social influence; Social network; Structural equivalence,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses predicting adoption probabilities based on various factors which aligns well with tactical decision-making in marketing, such as advanced targeting and marketing analytics.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Predicting adoption probabilities in social networks,2013
"The results of the following study show that among various neurophysiological measures, only the frontal asymmetry index measured with electroencephalography was significant in predicting further purchase decisions. The decision to buy was also influenced by the brand type (national brand or private label). Data from 21 participants were recorded during exposure to 20 fast-moving consumer goods. The electroencephalographic signal from the frontal lobe (F3 and F4) served to calculate the frontal asymmetry index for alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Electromyographic electrodes were placed on the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles, whereas the galvanic skin responses were gathered from the forefinger and ring finger of the nondominant hand. Eye tracking glasses were used to control for eye movements. After product exposure, participants filled in the Purchase Intentions Scale, which then served to assess the final binary decision. A logistic regression model was applied to determine which neurophysiological factors play a crucial role in predicting a purchase decision and whether the brand type is relevant. The prediction rate of the resulting model was 65.8%.

"Subject area: Managerial Accounting, Strategic Marketing. More specifically, cost behavior, cost estimation, cost prediction, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, contribution income statement and pricing/promotional strategy. Study level/applicability: This case is suitable to be used in advanced undergraduate level. Case overview: This case demonstrates the issues relating to pricing strategy of “Video Internet Marketing Training”. Diyana Tahir and her husband, Abdul Rahim Abdul Shukor, established Aras Design & Multimedia Centre (ADMC) on January 17, 2009. The main office was located at Kuala Lumpur. Diyana was a well-known name in the field of internet video marketing training. In its early years, ADMC’s operation was limited to providing printing and graphic design services and offering printing materials for photocopy. However, with the passage of time, the company began to expand its services and offerings. At the beginning of 2010, ADMC offered editing facilities and services for video and multimedia in addition to its core services. As a unique marketing strategy, Diyana offered RM30 as the basic training fee for each participant, which was equivalent to RM470 value offered. In this way, she attracted customers to take part in further advanced level training that was conducted by ADMC. However, she felt that the number of participant to take advanced training was not satisfactory. She thought that it happened perhaps due to the fact that the participants were not much committed to the course since it was offered at a nominal price. Furthermore, she realized that the cost of providing such training had risen in the past six months. Currently, ADMC suffered losses in three consecutive months, and they really needed enough cash to sustain. As such, Diyana was thinking to reconsider the offered course fees whether to increase it. She was in a rush to make a decision to propose the new course fee in the monthly meeting with management committee at the end of April 2013. Expected learning outcomes: Using this case, students can learn how a small-scale company can strategize its pricing strategy to survive in the highly competitive online market. The objectives of using this case are as follows: to help students in understanding the interrelationships between CVP in organization that can be used for future planning and decision-making; to be able to identify the cost structure of the basic training course (e.g. fixed and variable costs), determine the contribution margin, break-even point and prepare the contribution income statement that highlighting cost behavior; to help students to think critically while setting the price for the offered services; to develop students’ ability in analyzing the existing situation to come up with a viable and effective solution; to assist students in taking the right move in a right time; to broaden students’ views and understanding in considering the monetary aspect along with the human aspect in formulating an effective marketing strategy; to develop students’ understanding of the way to retain and attract customers through innovative pricing strategy; and to make students aware that innovation is the key to business success.

"Purpose – This paper aims to test whether a structured application of persuasion principles might help improve advertising decisions. Evidence-based principles are currently used to improve decisions in other complex situations, such as those faced in engineering and medicine. Design/methodology/approach – Scores were calculated from the ratings of 17 self-trained novices who rated 96 matched pairs of print advertisements for adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles. Predictions from traditional methods – 10,809 unaided judgments from novices and 2,764 judgments from people with some expertise in advertising and 288 copy-testing predictions – provided benchmarks. Findings – A higher adherence-to-principles-score correctly predicted the more effective advertisement for 75 per cent of the pairs. Copy testing was correct for 59 per cent, and expert judgment was correct for 55 per cent. Guessing would provide 50 per cent accurate predictions. Combining judgmental predictions led to substantial improvements in accuracy. Research limitations/implications – Advertisements for high-involvement utilitarian products were tested on the assumption that persuasion principles would be more effective for such products. The measure of effectiveness that was available –day-after-recall – is a proxy for persuasion or behavioral measures. Practical/implications – Pretesting advertisements by assessing adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles in a structured way helps in deciding which advertisements would be best to run. That procedure also identifies how to make an advertisement more effective. Originality/value – This is the first study in marketing, and in advertising specifically, to test the predictive validity of evidence-based principles.

The application of these language rules to persuasive campaigns through linguistic technology can result in major gains in advertising, political and marketing outcomes. For qualitative researchers in communications, marketing and messaging, one area of persuasive language technology can be found in the linguistic feature of symmetry. Language has many forms of symmetry, and most persuaders are unaware that a great deal of persuasion depends upon symmetrical message structures. In persuasion, a mirror image or symmetrical reflection of an attitude or opinion is more persuasive than a random or non-symmetrical message or idea.

"Online ads create opportunities for advisers to discover potential customers by delivering marketing massages through the Internet. Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profitability. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The research evaluation results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible.

"Buyer characteristics are a set of psychological, social, personal, and cultural factors which influence purchase decisions. Buyer characteristics lead to the purchase of a product or service, which impacts organization profit maximization and sustainability. Therefore, organizations emphasize building strong relationship with buyers. This has become a marketing priority in the current marketing environment. In airline perspective, the Malaysian low-cost airline industry is a major contributor to the national and global economy. However, the low-cost airline industry is facing purchase decision issues on domestic traveller aspect. Thus, the objective of this research is to investigate the significant relationship between buyer characteristics and purchase decision and to examine whether situational factors act to strengthen purchase decisions. As such, this research focused on how buyer characteristics impact purchase decision. In addition, situational factors as a moderation effect on purchase decision were tested using survey questionnaire. The sample for this research was 200 low-cost Malaysian travellers. The findings of this research revealed that buyer characteristic had a significant relationship with purchase decision and the situational factor moderated to strength the model with 62.5% of prediction.

"This paper integrates findings from marketing and finance literature to increase our understanding of consumers' decisions to purchase innovative investment products. Two different surveys administered to individual investors examine the psychological and sociological drivers of dispositional innovativeness and its effects on adoption timing and range of adoption for five new investment products. Study 1 shows that consumer psychographics (e.g., market mavenism, product-category involvement, and ambiguity intolerance) rather than socio-demographics (e.g., age, education, and risk profile) explain dispositional innovativeness and that dispositional innovativeness strongly impacts time of adoption and ownership of new investment products. Study 2 cross-validates the results of Study 1 and investigates the indirect effects of dispositional innovativeness on adoption timing through consumers' perceptions of new investment products' complexity, riskiness, and visibility (exposure to and engagement in word-of-mouth). Individuals who score high on dispositional innovativeness adopt new investment products quickly because they perceive lower complexity and greater visibility, not because they perceive lower risk. The combined results of Studies 1 and 2 show that individual investors' psychological and sociological roots systematically explain their innovative adoption behavior and indicate that - counter to standard finance predictions - they incorporate more than just risk-return trade-offs in their investment choices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Hoffmann A.O.I.; Broekhuizen T.L.J.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2010.08.002,Consumer financial decision-making; Dispositional innovativeness; Individual investor decision-making; Marketing-finance interface; New product adoption,5.0,,15,0,,"The paper examines the psychological and sociological drivers influencing consumer decisions regarding the adoption of innovative investment products, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing by interpreting strategic goals into actionable insights about consumer behavior.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Understanding investors' decisions to purchase innovative products: Drivers of adoption timing and range,2010
"As the online channel matures, many firms are finding that an understanding of how their online customers' preferences and choices vary across geographical markets can be very useful. In this paper, we propose a spatial multinomial model of customer choice and illustrate how spatial modeling of choices of online customers across geographical markets provides useful insights in the context of a product mix and pricing decision of an online book publisher. The spatial multinomial model specifically accounts for the spatial correlations among customer choices among different product forms - print and PDF. The estimation results obtained using data generated from an online experiment show that the spatial model accounts for the geographical variation in many of the unobserved effects possibly due to locational differences and price sensitivities. The resultant spatial decision maps provide useful predictions as to how purchase rates vary across geographical markets as a function of the price differential between product forms, with implications for targeting customers through local market advertising, direct marketing, and cross-channel promotion. © 2005 INFORMS.",Jank W.; Kannan P.K.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1050.0145,Digital products; Internet; Mixed multinomial logit; Pricing; Spatial model,5.0,,20,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of a spatial multinomial model to analyze customer choices and preferences in a specific context, focusing on product mix and pricing decisions for an online book publisher.

"In this paper we explain how practice, prior knowledge and task difficulty interact to affect demand for hedonic experiences. As predicted by the human capital model, we propose that the key determinant of demand for hedonic experiences is the increase in performance efficiency that can be gained through practice. In addition, we argue that the nature of the effect of practice is distinctly different in hedonic consumption, compared to utilitarian consumption. Specifically, for hedonic experiences, practice allows consumers to extract greater value within a given period of time, rather than reduce the amount of time spent on a (utilitarian) task. Finally, we argue that if changes in performance efficiency across repeated hedonic experiences adhere to the power law of practice, then both prior knowledge and task difficulty will be important moderators of the main effect of practice on demand.

"Purpose - Quantitative measures are not commonly available to identify and measure product cannibalization resulting from the introduction of new products, and existing forecasting methods such as ARIMA do not xplicitly account for the phenomenon. This paper aims to present a methodology to build cannibalization effects into forecasting models as measured through product attributes. It follows on from a paper by the same authors in Vol. 23 No. 4. Design/methodology/approach - The contribution of product attributes to cannibalization is tested by a series of hypotheses, then integrated into the proposed cannibalization model. Results are compared with predictions from an ARIMA-based model and actual historical sales data. Findings - The proposed model improves on the fidelity of ARIMA-based models, by between 16 and 42 percent. Originality/value - Effective prediction of cannibalization losses will allow marketing planners to make better-informed decisions with respect to new product introduction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Srinivasan S.R.; Ramakrishnan S.; Grasman S.E.,Tactical,10.1108/02634500510612645,Forecasting; Market share; New products; Quantitative methods,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract focuses on developing a methodology to forecast product cannibalization, which is a tactical decision related to product introduction and marketing strategies.

"Advancements in wireless communications have increased the number of people using mobile devices, and have accelerated the growth of mobile commerce (m-commerce). This study aims to investigate the factors that predict consumer intention to adopt m-commerce in Malaysia and China. The work extends the traditional technology acceptance model (TAM) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) model, and includes additional variables such as trust, cost, social influence, variety of services, and control variables such as age, educational level, and gender of consumers. By comparing consumers from both Malaysia and China, this research is able to form a prediction model based on two different cultural settings. Data was collected from 172 Malaysian consumers and 222 Chinese consumers, and hierarchical regression analysis was employed to test the research model. The results showed that age, trust, cost, social influence, and variety of services are able to predict Malaysian consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. Trust, cost, and social influence can be used to predict Chinese consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. This research confirms the need to extend the traditional TAM and DOI models when studying technology such as m-commerce. The results from this study will be useful for telecommunication and m-commerce companies in formulating marketing strategies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets © 2010, American Marketing Association.",Saini R.; Rao R.S.; Monga A.,Tactical,10.1509/jmkg.74.1.34,Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Sales promotions,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses specific marketing strategies related to consumer behavior and pricing, which align with tactical decision-making in marketing activities such as sales promotions and dynamic pricing.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Is that deal worth my time?

"The primary objective of the multiattribute models in the area of marketing is to discover the way the consumers make their choice among available alternative products. Discovering the process of choice of the customers serves as a basis for many marketing decisions such as new product planning, advertising message selection, product positioning, pricing, concept testing, sales forecasting, benefit segmentation, personal selling strategy formulation, etc. The multiattribute models proposed for this purpose can be grouped into two classes: (i) models based on mathematical programming techniques, and (ii) models based on statistical techniques. The recent literature surveys indicate that the results obtained from linear programming models show greater stability and better predictive ability. In this study therefore we will concentrate only on the mathematical programming methods of estimation in general and on a new market share prediction model in particular. The main feature of the proposed model is that it recognizes the dependence of attribute weights on attribute scores through a step function. The predictive ability of the model is discussed via a hypothetical numerical example. © 1989.",Oral M.; Kettani O.,Tactical,10.1016/0169-2070(89)90064-2,Market share; Mathematical programming; Multiattribute choice,5.0,,20,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of multiattribute models in marketing to understand consumer choice, which is more aligned with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into specific targets and actions.",scopus-prediction,15,60,A mathematical programming model for market share prediction,1989
"Several studies have shown that promotions of national brands yield more effect than those of store brands; (e.g, Allenby and Rossi 1991, Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989). However the evolution of price-quality data available from Consumer Reports over the last 15 years seems to reveal a reduction of the quality gap between store brands and national brands, while price differences remain substantial. Simultaneously, the share of private label brands has increased (Progressive Grocer 1994). In this context, we study whether we can maintain a view of the world where national brands may easily attract consumers from store brands through promotions, whereas store brands are relatively ineffective in attracting consumers from national brands by such means. We analyze consumer reactions to price discounts in a parsimonious preference model featuring loss aversion and reference-dependence along dimensions of price and quality (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993, Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The key result of our analysis is that, given any two brands, there is an asymmetric promotion effect in favor of the higher quality /higher price brands if and only if the quality gap between the brands is sufficiently large in comparison with the price gap. Thus, the direction of promotion asymmetry is not unconditional. It depends uniquely on the value of the ratio of quality and price differences compared to a category specific criterion, which we call Φ. If the ratio of quality and price differences is larger than this criterion, the usual asymmetry prevails; if such is not the case, the lower quality/ lower price brands promote more effectively. More precisely, our model predicts that cross promotion effects depend on two components of brand positioning in the price/quality quadrant. First, we define a variable termed ""positioning advantage"" that indicates whether, relative to the standards achieved by another brand, a given brand is under-priced (positive advantage) or overpriced (negative advantage). Promotion effectiveness is increasing in this variable. Second, cross promotion effects between two brands depend on their distance in the price/quality quadrant. This variable impacts promotion effectiveness negatively and symmetrically for any pair of brands. ""Positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance"" are orthogonal components of brand positioning, irrespective of the degree of correlation between available price and quality levels in the market. Empirically, we investigate the role of brand positioning in explaining cross promotion effects using panel data from the chilled orange juice and peanut butter categories. We compute the independent positioning variables, ""positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance,"" from readily available data on price and quality positioning after obtaining our estimates of Φ. We next measure promotion effectiveness by estimating choice share changes in response to a price discount, using a choice model that does not contain any information about quality/price ratios. Finally, we test the relation between the two positioning variables and the promotion effectiveness measures. The data reveal that in the orange juice category lower quality/lower price brands generally promote more effectively than higher quality/higher price brands. In the peanut butter data the opposite asymmetry holds. In both cases, inter-brand promotion patterns are well explained by the positioning variables. An attractive feature of our model is that, in addition to the direction of promotion asymmetries, it also explains the extent of those asymmetries. A further interesting aspect of this approach is that we go beyond a categorization of brands into price tiers. For instance, lower tier brands in our data may promote more effectively than one national brand but less effectively than another. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the data presented here seem to confirm that such cases occur because the lower tier brand offers a favorable trade-off of price and quality differences compared with one national brand and a less favorable trade-off compared with the other. The content of this paper is potentially relevant for brand managers or retailers concerned with predicting the impact of their promotions. The paper is of particular interest to marketing scientists who study the performance of store brands versus national brands and may also appeal to those who wish to explore the marketing implications of behavioral decision theory. Finally, our investigation does not reject Blattberg and Wisniewski's (1989) finding, shared by Allenby and Rossi (1991) and Hardie, Johnson, and Fader (1993), that national brands have a principle advantage in promotion effectiveness. Rather, it formalizes when this principle advantage is overruled by positioning disadvantages of such brands.",Bronnenberg B.J.; Wathieu L.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.15.4.379,Brand choice; Brand positioning; Loss aversion; Promotion; Reference-dependence,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses specific marketing strategies related to promotions and consumer behavior, indicating a focus on implementing and optimizing those strategies effectively.

"Firms design products that appeal to consumers and are feasible to produce. The resulting marketing and engineering design goals are driven by consumer preferences and engineering capabilities, two issues that conveniently are addressed in isolation from one another. This convenient isolation, however, typically will not result in optimal product decisions when the two problems are interrelated. A method new to the marketing community, analytical target cascading (ATC), is adopted here to explore such interrelationships and to formalize the process of coordinating marketing and engineering design problems in a way that is proven to yield the joint optimal solution. The ATC model is built atop well-established marketing methodologies, such as conjoint, discrete choice modeling and demand forecasting. The method is demonstrated in the design of dial-readout household scales, using real conjoint choice data and a parametric engineering product design model. Results indicate that the most profitable achievable product can fall short of predictions based on marketing alone but well ahead of what engineering may produce based on original marketing target specifications. A number of extensions can be accomplished readily using techniques from the extant marketing and design optimization literature.",Michalek J.J.; Feinberg F.M.; Papalambros P.Y.,Tactical,10.1111/j.0737-6782.2005.00102.x,,5.0,,25,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of analytical target cascading (ATC) to coordinate marketing and engineering design problems, which falls under tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into actionable product design and development targets.",scopus-prediction,20,50,Linking marketing and engineering product design decisions via analytical target cascading,2005
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of consumers' erroneous affective self-forecasts, and discuss the implications of such forecasts for consumer purchasing behaviour and marketing planning. Design/methodology/approach - First, the literature on inaction inertia - the lowering of the likelihood that a bargain will be taken once a better bargain has been missed - is reviewed. Second, the literature on affective self-forecasting is reviewed. Finally, the implications that the authors synthesis of the behavioural evidence carries for marketing are discussed. Findings - The in action inertia literature implicates the regret that consumers associate with purchasing a discounted item once they have missed a much larger discount on it as a major contributing factor to consumers' unwillingness to purchase the item on the second occasion. The literature on affective self-prediction suggests that regret (and other emotions) is systematically mispredicted. Research limitations/implications - The likely effect of erroneously anticipated regret in inaction inertia situations is depressed purchasing behaviour. The paper argues that because affective anticipations are typically erroneous, their impact on consumer decision-making processes cannot be deemed rational. It is proposed that marketing should intervene to either increase the accuracy of such anticipations, or to lead consumers to discount them. Practical implications - Price promotions can have negative side effects, such as those observed in inaction inertia circumstances. To some extent, these are driven by consumers anticipated regret (and possibly other relevant emotions). Marketing techniques can counteract the disproportionate impact of such emotions. Originality/value - The paper offers a synthesis of behavioural evidence on inaction inertia and affective self-forecasting - two quite separate literatures that have yet to be brought together in the present context. In addition, the paper outlines implications for marketing and suggests possible strategies to moderate the discussed effects.",Sevdalis N.; Kokkinaki F.; Harvey N.,Tactical,10.1108/02634500810879287,Advertising; Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Pricing; Sales forecasting,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior and marketing implications related to purchasing decisions, specifically addressing how erroneous affective self-forecasts can impact marketing strategies and promotions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-prediction,20,60,Anticipating a regrettable purchase: Implications of erroneous affective forecasting for marketing planning,2008
"Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models managerially more useful. © 2008, American Marketing Association.",Wübben M.; Wangenheim F.V.,Tactical,10.1509/jmkg.72.3.82,Customer base analysis; Customer management; Direct marketing; Heuristics; Relationship marketing,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the application of stochastic customer base analysis models in managerial decision-making.

"To gain a sense of the persuasive efficacy of a message prior to implementation of a campaign, researchers often gather judgments of perceived effectiveness (PE). At present, they do so without much knowledge of the conceptual meaning or empirical properties of PE. In the spirit of construct explication, we report a study intended to address a series of questions about PE. Using student (N = 155) and community samples (N = 100), we found the following: (a) PE is a two-dimensional judgment involving global evaluations of message impact and specific judgments of message attributes, but it may be reducible to a single second-order factor, (b) most individuals reported using more than one referent (i.e., person or group) when making PE judgments, but the choice of referents varies by message and judge, and (c) judgments of PE are biased upward as a function of the number of referents chosen. Suggestions are offered for enhancing the validity of PE judgments in formative campaign research.

"Marketing managers typically have to use and integrate many pieces of data and marketing intelligence when taking decisions such as whether to launch a product and, if so, at what price. Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers' responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity - a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making.
