"Marketing and consumer research use a variety of data and electronic measurement devices for research, theory-building, and applied decision-making. Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.",Hornik J.; Ofir C.; Rachamim M.,Strategic,10.1007/s11301-024-00441-0,Artificial intelligence (AI); Digital marketing; Edge computing; Fog computing; Marketing internet of things (MIoT); O; Smart marketing; Software defined networks (SDN),5.0,,10,5,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses the implications of IoT-driven fog computing for smart marketing, indicating a long-term vision for how technology can enhance marketing strategies.

"Companies neither fully exploit the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), nor that of Machine Learning (ML), its most prominent method. This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics. © 2022 The Authors",Volkmar G.; Fischer P.M.; Reinecke S.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.04.007,Artificial Intelligence; Decision- Making; Delphi Method; Ethics; Machine Learning; Marketing Management,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of AI and ML in marketing, focusing on long-term challenges and opportunities such as culture, strategy, and ethics, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-ai,60,25,"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Exploring drivers, barriers, and future developments in marketing management",2022
"Despite offering substantial opportunities to tailor services to consumers’ wants and needs, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies often come with ethical and operational challenges. One salient instance of such challenges emerges when vulnerable consumers, consumers who temporarily or permanently lack resource access or control, are unknowingly discriminated against, or excluded from the marketplace. By integrating the literature on consumer vulnerability, AI for social good, and the calls for rethinking marketing for a better world, the current work builds a framework on how to leverage AI technologies to detect, better serve, and empower vulnerable consumers. Specifically, our AID framework advocates for designing AI technologies that make services more accessible, optimize customer experiences and journeys interactively, and to dynamically improve consumer decision-making. Adopting a multi-stakeholder perspective, we also discuss the respective implications for researchers, managers, consumers, and public policy makers. © 2023, The Author(s).",Hermann E.; Williams G.Y.; Puntoni S.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-023-00986-8,Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Justice; Service; Vulnerable consumers,5.0,,10,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of leveraging AI technologies to serve vulnerable consumers and outlines a framework for integrating AI into marketing strategies, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-ai,60,20,Deploying artificial intelligence in services to AID vulnerable consumers,2023
"Introduction – Current study examines the relationship between Digital Advertising (DA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their impact on creating a suitable Marketing Strategy (MS) for any organization. The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation. © 2022,Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

"Corporate identity plays an important role in the success and competitiveness of businesses in today’s dynamic business environment. It encompasses brand identity, organisational culture, values, and reputation, and is key in building relationships with stakeholders. An ethical corporate identity, in particular the perception of a company as ethical and socially responsible, positively influences employee behaviour and engagement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised business management and offers innovative solutions to improve decision-making, efficiency, and transparency. Integrating AI into corporate governance can improve risk management, compliance, and accountability. In the digital age, social media are key in building and maintaining the brand voice of businesses. With the advent of AI, new tools such as Chat GPT have emerged to simplify and accelerate content creation, including social media posts. However, achieving satisfactory brand-voice results using AI requires careful analysis and extensive, representative data that travels into the prompter. Although AI-generated content is fast, it should be vetted by experienced experts to ensure it aligns with brand values and brand image. Although Chat GPT promises to generate content and brand-voice, its successful use requires collaboration with experienced experts and thoughtful consideration of its use in building and maintaining an authentic and effective brand-voice. © (2024), (University of SS.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review literature about the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic situations and identify the research that is needed in the area of applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings: There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications: The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Stone M.; Aravopoulou E.; Ekinci Y.; Evans G.; Hobbs M.; Labib A.; Laughlin P.; Machtynger J.; Machtynger L.,Strategic,10.1108/BL-03-2020-0022,Artificial intelligence; Decision-making; Marketing; Operations; Planning; Strategy,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the application of AI in strategic marketing decision-making, emphasizing the long-term implications and the need for research in this area as the focus shifts from operational to strategic applications of AI.",scopus-ai,70,15,Artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic marketing decision-making: a research agenda,2020
"The latest effort in delivering computing resources as a service to managers and consumers represents a shift away from computing as a product that is purchased, to computing as a service that is delivered to users over the internet from large-scale data centers. However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.",Hornik J.; Ofir C.; Rachamim M.; Graguer S.,Strategic,10.3390/jtaer19010032,artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs),5.0,,10,5,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, which indicates a focus on long-term implications and the exploration of novel research avenues.

"Artificial intelligence is a technology that simulates human intelligence by simulating human learning, reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities through computer systems. In recent years, the rapid development and widespread application of AI have had a profound impact on enterprise management. Enterprise management is no longer limited to traditional manual decision-making and processes, but has been endowed with more efficient and intelligent methods through AI technology. The value co creation theory has completely changed the management methods of modern enterprises, transforming them from simple value carriers to active value co creators. In this situation, enterprise value chain management requires strategic enhancement, optimized design, functional management, and reputation management to adapt to these changes. The emergence of artificial intelligence as the core of the new industrial revolution further amplifies the importance of these adaptations. Under the guidance of value co creation theory, this article analyzes and explores the structure, characteristics, and transformation of enterprise value chains. Explored the management strategies of enterprise value chains, with a particular focus on the composition of consumer centered value chains. In addition, it also studied the use of artificial intelligence to deepen the enterprise management value chain, strengthen its architecture through artificial intelligence technology, and design an effective enterprise management system. Considering the changes in the business model of the entire value chain system, the transformation mechanism of artificial intelligence in the enterprise value chain was studied. Integrating neural network algorithms into enterprise management systems can achieve optimization and form a new enterprise management value chain. Empirical experiments and surveys have proven the effectiveness of the new value chain, significantly improving customer satisfaction (11.45%), customer experience satisfaction (13.61%), enterprise marketing satisfaction (11.73%), and enterprise service satisfaction (10.63%). © 2023, Success Culture Press.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed the way organizations communicate, understand, and interact with their potential consumers. In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders’ perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an “intelligent advertising” AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising. Several research questions are offered to guide future research on intelligent advertising to benefit ethical AI decision-making. Finally, several areas that can be widely applied to ethical intelligent advertising are suggested for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).",Rodgers W.; Nguyen T.,Strategic,10.1007/s10551-022-05048-7,AI Algorithms; Digital marketing; Ethical considerations,5.0,,10,5,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,"The abstract discusses the ethical implications of AI in advertising, outlining long-term considerations and philosophical approaches that guide decision-making.

"According to the sole normative foundation for trademark protection—“search costs” theory—trademarks transmit useful information to consumers, enabling an efficient marketplace. The marketplace, however, is in the midst of a fundamental change. Increasingly, retail is virtual, marketing is data-driven, and purchasing decisions are automated by AI. Predictive analytics are changing how consumers shop. Search costs theory no longer accurately describes the function of trademarks in this marketplace. Consumers now have numerous digital alternatives to trademarks that more efficiently provide them with increasingly accurate product information. Just as store shelves are disappearing from consumers’ retail experience, so are trademarks disappearing from their product search. Consumers may want to buy a product where the brand is the essential feature of the product such that the brand is the product, but they no longer need the assistance of a trademark to find the product. By reflexively continuing to protect trademarks in the name of search costs theory, courts give only lip service to consumer interests without questioning whether trademarks are fulfilling any useful information function. In many cases, trademarks may actually misinform consumers by masking the identity of the producer or its distanced relationship with the trademark owner. Without having deliberately decided to do so, trademark law is now protecting “brands as property” without any supportive normative rationale. Removing the veil of search costs theory will enable courts to consider whether trademark protection is justified in particular cases. © 2023, University of Washington School of Law.

"The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in various industries to provide innovative and intelligent features in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Big industries started adopting AI for their HR and workforce management (WFM) activities, however, past literature suggests a lack of AI adoption in MSMEs. In the ongoing pandemic, a large number of job loss is reported in the literature. Thus, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent workforce management (WFM) may be critical during or post-pandemic to manage the huge employment in MSMEs. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual framework based on three areas where AI-powered WFM adoption for MSMEs revenue development has been highlighted. These are (a) risk management (workforce), (b) business and marketing, and (c) information exchange. Six hypotheses have been proposed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) with responses from 307 employees. According to the research findings, all of the offered hypotheses are significant. The findings suggest to MSME decision-makers that AI-powered WFM may help revenue growth, workforce risk reduction, intelligent business and marketing, and thoughtful, innovative, and safe information exchange.

"Curiously, there are few contributions in the scientific literature on the subject of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on aeronautics. However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies.

"AI climate-driven service analytics capability has been anecdotally argued as a viable strategy to enhance service innovation and market performance in B2B markets. While AI climate refers to the shared perceptions of policies, procedures, and practices to support AI initiatives, cognitive service analytics capability refers to the analytical insights driven by AI climate and augmented by both machines and humans to make marketing decisions. However, there is limited knowledge on the antecedents of such analytics capabilities and their overall effects on service innovation and market performance.

"Learning outcomes: The expected learning outcomes are to understand the complexities involved in the integration of two carriers with different business strategies and approaches, the merger of two brands with distinct personas and identities and the confluence of two different cultures; figure out the strategic options in front of the Tata Group and how it can deal with various macro- and micro-level business challenges, defy the financial hiccups and manoeuvre the operational complexities to accomplish mission Vihaan.AI; and develop a pragmatic approach to macro and micro business environmental scanning for making strategic business decisions. Case overview/synopsis: In November 2022, Tata Group, the salt to software conglomerate, announced the merger of Air India (AI) and Vistara. This would lead to the formation of the full-service airline under the brand name “Air India”. The obvious reason behind this was the higher recognition, salience and recall of the brand AI as compared with Vistara in the global market. The Tata Group envisaged the brand AI to be a significant international aviation player with the heritage, persona and ethos of the brand Vistara in the renewed manifestation of AI. To realise these goals, Tata Group laid down an ambitious plan called “Vihaan.AI”, which was aimed at capturing a domestic market share of 30% by 2027.

"Purpose: Companies utilize increasingly capable Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to deliver modern services across a range of consumer service industries. AI autonomy, however, sparks skepticism among consumers leading to a decrease in their willingness to adopt AI services. This raises the question as to whether consumer trust in companies can overcome consumer reluctance in their decisions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services. Design/methodology/approach: Using a representative survey (N = 503 consumers corresponding to N = 3,690 observations), this article investigated the link between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services from the company across 23 consumer service companies accounting for six distinct service industries. Findings: The results confirm a significant and positive relationship between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt AI services from the same company. AI autonomy, however, moderates this relationship, such that high (vs low) AI autonomy weakens the positive link between trust in a company and AI service adoption. This finding replicates across all 23 companies and the associated six industries and is robust to the inclusion of several theoretically important control variables. Originality/value: The current research contributes to the recent stream of AI research by drawing attention to the interplay between trust in companies and adoption of high autonomy AI services, with implications for the successful deployment and marketing of AI services. © 2023, Darius-Aurel Frank, Lina Fogt Jacobsen, Helle Alsted Søndergaard and Tobias Otterbring.",Frank D.-A.; Jacobsen L.F.; Søndergaard H.A.; Otterbring T.,Strategic,10.1108/ITP-09-2022-0721,Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Innovation adoption; Trust in the company,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the relationship between consumer trust and the adoption of AI services, which pertains to long-term organizational goals and strategies for successfully deploying AI technologies in consumer service industries.",scopus-ai,70,20,In companies we trust: consumer adoption of artificial intelligence services and the role of trust in companies and AI autonomy,2023
"Artificial intelligence (AI) can affect all of a company's functions, not least the purchasing department. In addition to automating and optimizing existing processes, AI opens up new opportunities for purchasers to undertake new, strategic, collaborative, enduring missions. AI enables complex, strategic decision-making in an unpredictable, hostile environment. This article analyzes to what extent AI can improve the performance of the purchasing department. First, a review is undertaken of how AI is used in purchasing. Thereafter, the research follows an exploratory, inductive, and qualitative approach based on a multiple case study of the following technologies: (1) the Synertrade automated international purchasing system; (2) the Silex matching system; (3) SAP Ariba decision support; (4) Jaggaer supplier relations management; and (5) the Ideapoke collaborative ideation and innovative project management platform.

"Purpose: The paper examines the increase in annual income of the new middle-class (The NMC) of Delhi-NCR and its impact on their investment habits, consumption habits and lifestyle. The paper aims to look into the transformation of the new middle-class into the NMC in emerging economies and its potential to the companies and investors. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws insight from 558 new middle-class consumers in Delhi-NCR. ANOVA, post hoc tests, and hierarchical multiple linear regression model are applied to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The NMC living in India's megacities imitates the lifestyle of their counterparts living in the West. To maintain their status and present themselves different from those living in middle or lower-middle-class categories, they spend audaciously, even though the income is low. When they enter the new middle class, their consumption, saving and lifestyle diversify positively. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations. First, the authors do not apply any behavioral theory or marketing model such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA), Engel-kollat-Blackwell (EKB) model or theory of normative model of target markets. Second, the research is limited to the NMC of only one emerging economy, i.e., India. Third, the research sample is limited to only one megacity of India, i.e., Delhi. Finally, this research used only one factor, i.e., AI, to study the consumption pattern. Practical implications: The results suggest that considering the buying habits and lifestyle of Indian the NMC, consumers would prove helpful to the companies in product decision-making. Furthermore, understanding change in investment habits across different income levels would be advantageous to financial institutions, investment planners and marketers while designing their products to attract investment. Originality/value: The research holds significance from the point of view of understanding Indian consumers encompassing the the NMC and predicting their implications on consumer goods-producing industries, which shall, in turn, facilitate producers and government in formulating policies and strategies. © 2021, Asiya Chaudhary and Sabiha Khatoon.",Chaudhary A.; Khatoon S.,Strategic,10.1108/JABES-07-2020-0080,Annual income (AI); Buying/ spending habits (B/SH); Consumer behavior (CB); Investment habits (IH); Lifestyle (LS); Middle class (MC); New middle class (NMC),5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The paper examines the long-term implications of the new middle-class (NMC) in Delhi-NCR on consumer habits and its effects on companies and investors, which aligns with strategic planning and understanding market trends.",scopus-ai,50,30,Impact of the new middle class on consumer behavior: a case study of Delhi-NCR,2022

"Purpose: Technology is revolutionizing the management logic of service systems. The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, is challenging interaction between humans and machines changing the service systems’ value co-creation configurations and logic. To envision possible future scenarios, this paper aims to reflect upon how the humans’ use of AI technology can impact value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is developed, at a conceptual level, using selected elements from managerial and marketing theoretical frameworks interested in value co-creation – Service-Dominant Logic, Service Science and Viable Systems Approach (VSA) – used as interpretative tools to reframe value co-creation in the digital age. Findings: The interpretative approach adopted and, in particular, the new VSA notion of Intelligence Augmentation (IA), in the perspective of the information variety model, shed new light on value co-creation in the digital age framing a possible “IA effect” that can empower value co-creation in complex decision-making contexts. Practical implications: The study provides insights useful in the design and management of service systems suggesting a rethinking of the view of AI as a means for mainly increasing the smartness of service systems and a new focus on the enhancement of the human resources contribution to make the service systems wiser.

"Purpose: Few well-documented studies have explained the importance of researching firms' marketing analytics capability (FMAC). In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance.

"Consumer resistance is a major barrier to diffusing radical innovation into mainstream markets. While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Casidy R.; Claudy M.; Heidenreich S.; Camurdan E.,Strategic,10.1002/mar.21496,artificial intelligence; autonomous vehicles; brand concept; innovation; self-brand connection,5.0,,10,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of consumer resistance to radical innovation and the role of branding in overcoming this resistance, aligning with strategic planning objectives.",scopus-ai,60,25,The role of brand in overcoming consumer resistance to autonomous vehicles,2021

"Purpose: This study aims to empirically investigate the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing (AIM) and business performance from the resource-based view (RBV) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A survey strategy was used in this study to collect data from 225 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) respondents who were on the registered list of the Ghana Enterprise Agency in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Structural equation modeling – path analysis was used to estimate the impact of AIM on the performance of SMEs. Findings: The analyzed data shows that AIM has significant impact on the financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance in the case of SMEs in Ghana. This study establishes the significance of AIM approach in achieving financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance through the application of AIM determinants including, Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative decision-making systems (CDMS), virtual and augmented reality (VAR) and personalization. Research limitations/implications: Aside the aforementioned significance of this research study, this study has limitations. The sample size of this research study can be expanded to include SME respondents in other geographical areas that were not considered in this study. Future research studies should concentrate on how AIM can analyze customer communications and information such as posts on social media to develop future communications that may enhance customer engagement. Practical implications: The practical implications comprise of two key items. First, this research study encourages SME owners and managers to develop an AIM method as a fundamental strategic goal in their pursuit to improve SME performance. Second, SME owners and managers should increasingly implement the four determinants of AIM indicated in this research study (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) to develop essential resources for effective application of AIM to improve their performance. Originality/value: The results of this study provide a strong support to RBV theory and the proposition that AIM and its determinants (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) should be recognized as an essential strategic resource for improving the performance (i.e., financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance) of SMEs.

"Technology finance, which has attracted worldwide attention for the successful business development of small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) or start-ups, has advanced an innovation or stagnation way-out resolution strategy for companies in line with the low-growth economic trends. Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R&D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company’s management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company’s growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm’s commercialization strategy. For the last years, the KIBO Patent Appraisal System (KPAS-II) herein proposed has been advanced by KIBO as a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI) and evaluation data applications valuation system that automatically calculates and estimates a technology’s feasible economic value by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic index information of a patent and the commercialization entity’s business ca-pabilities, and by applying to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method in valuation theory, and finally integrating with deep learning results based on the in-advance previously established patent DB and the financial DB. The KPAS-II proposed in this study can be said to have dramatically overcome the long-term preparation period and high levels of R&D and commercialization costs in terms of the limitations that the existing technology valuation method possesses by enhancing the reliability of approximate economic values from the deep learning results based on financial data and completed valuation data. In addition, it is expected that technology marketing coordinators, researchers, and non-specialty business agents, not limited to valuation experts, can easily estimate the economic values of their patents or technologies, and they can be actively utilized in a technology-based company’s decision-making and technologically dependent financial activities. © 2021 by the authors.

"The research was designed to contribute to scientific efforts in exploring the attitude of fashion stakeholders towards AI and its use in attaining sustainability in fashion industry. Although the role of AI in Fashion has been studied before, the aim of this research is to challenge and analyze the attitudes towards sustainable fashion of both stakeholders and consumers. The research considers the views of consumers, industry professionals and company shareholders on the role AI plays in pursuing ideas of Sustainable Fashion. Contrary to expectations, the companies with significant turnover did not show any greater awareness of the new trends in the fashion business. Furthermore, previous familiarity with the usage of AI did not prove to promote openness towards the recommendation of apps which use AI to promote Sustainable Fashion. The value of this research lies in the findings, which help provide a framework which can be used to change the viewpoint of the key market players.

"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked interest in various areas, including marketing. However, this exhilaration is being tempered by growing concerns about the moral and legal implications of using AI in marketing. Although previous research has revealed various ethical and legal issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and data privacy, there are no definitive answers. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating AI’s ethical and legal concerns in marketing and suggesting feasible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper synthesises information from academic articles, industry reports, case studies and legal documents through a thematic literature review. A qualitative analysis approach categorises and interprets ethical and legal challenges and proposes potential solutions. Findings: The findings of this paper raise concerns about ethical and legal challenges related to AI in the marketing area. Ethical concerns related to discrimination, bias, manipulation, job displacement, absence of social interaction, cybersecurity, unintended consequences, environmental impact, privacy and legal issues such as consumer security, responsibility, liability, brand protection, competition law, agreements, data protection, consumer protection and intellectual property rights are discussed in the paper, and their potential solutions are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding the interesting insights gathered from this investigation of the ethical and legal consequences of AI in marketing, it is important to recognise the limits of this research. Initially, the focus of this study is confined to a review of the most important ethical and legal issues pertaining to AI in marketing. Additional possible repercussions, such as those associated with intellectual property, contracts and licencing, should be investigated more deeply in future studies. Despite the fact that this study gives various answers and best practices for tackling the stated ethical and legal concerns, the viability and efficacy of these solutions may differ depending on the context and industry. Thus, more research and case studies are required to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of these solutions in other circumstances. This research is mostly based on a literature review and may not represent the experiences or opinions of all stakeholders engaged in AI-powered marketing. Further study might involve interviews or surveys with marketing professionals, customers and other key stakeholders to offer a full knowledge of the practical difficulties and solutions. Because of the rapid speed of technical progress, AI’s ethical and regulatory ramifications in marketing are continually increasing. Consequently, this work should be a springboard for more research and continuing conversations on this subject. Practical implications: This study’s findings have several practical implications for marketing professionals. Emphasising openness and explainability: Marketing professionals should prioritise transparency in their use of AI, ensuring that customers are fully informed about data collection and utilisation for targeted advertising. By promoting openness and explainability, marketers can foster customer trust and avoid the negative consequences of a lack of transparency. Establishing ethical guidelines: Marketing professionals need to develop ethical rules for the creation and implementation of AI-powered marketing strategies. Adhering to ethical principles ensures compliance with legal norms and aligns with the organisation’s values and ideals. Investing in bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology: To mitigate risks associated with AI in marketing, marketers should allocate resources to develop and implement bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology. These tools can identify and address biases in AI algorithms, safeguard consumer privacy and extract valuable insights from consumer data. Social implications: This study’s social implications emphasise the need for a comprehensive approach to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing. This includes adopting a responsible innovation framework, promoting ethical leadership, using ethical decision-making frameworks and conducting multidisciplinary research. By incorporating these approaches, marketers can navigate the complexities of AI in marketing responsibly, foster an ethical organisational culture, make informed ethical decisions and develop effective solutions. Such practices promote public trust, ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk, and mitigate potential negative social consequences associated with AI in marketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is among the first to explore potential solutions comprehensively. This paper provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges by using a multidisciplinary framework and synthesising various sources.

"The introduction of AI-based technologies has dramatically altered the premises for consumer privacy, enabling the unprecedented manipulation of consumers’ decision-making online. Given these recent threats to consumer privacy and autonomy, and considering autonomy as the ultimate outcome of privacy, I propose that a reconceptualization is warranted to reflect contemporary consumer privacy challenges and to realign the concept with its theoretical foundations. To this end, I introduce the dimension of decisional privacy, focused on autonomy versus interference in consumer decision-making. Building on previous privacy literature and extending previous theorizing about information privacy and decisional privacy as complementary, I posit that these two dimensions of privacy together comprise consumer privacy. Addressing protection from interference as an under-communicated function of consumer privacy, the paper aims to clarify, exemplify, and engage in the conceptual development of decisional privacy in the context of consumer decision-making online. In addition to its significance for consumer wellbeing and democracy collectively, the extension of consumer privacy to explicitly encompass interference has theoretical implications for privacy concern, the proxy used to measure privacy, yielding important insights for marketing scholars and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2024.",Bjørlo L.V.,Strategic,10.1007/s13162-024-00273-x,Autonomy; Consumer privacy; Decisional privacy; Privacy; Privacy concerns,10.0,,10,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses the need for a reconceptualization of consumer privacy in light of AI technologies and their implications for autonomy and decision-making.

"When do consumers trust artificial intelligence (AI)? With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision-making literature. Moreover, this study makes practical implications for marketers of AI businesses including those who strategically use AI-generated information. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Kim J.; Giroux M.; Lee J.C.,Strategic,10.1002/mar.21498,AI adoption; AI technology; artificial intelligence; marketing; preciseness; recommendation; trust,10.0,,10,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study explores the relationship between consumer trust in AI and the presentation of information, which has implications for long-term strategies in marketing and AI adoption.

"The research conducted aimed to determine the most attractive digital marketing technologies for future investment opportunities. This was achieved through a cross-priority ranking analysis, which identified trends in the development of digital technologies in marketing communications and global marketing. Data from 25 expert organisations was used to form a set of 32 digital solutions. Using a developed methodology, these solutions were ranked, revealing the top 6 with the highest potential for transforming marketing communications. The rankings showed a discrepancy between the mentioned frequency ranking and the priority ranking, indicating the influence of marketing organizations' experience. Currently, social media platforms, particularly influencer marketing, are closely integrated with e-commerce, explaining their high mention frequency. However, a cross-ranking analysis revealed a trend towards AI technologies in marketing communications processes. It has been established that obtaining credit funds for the deployment of modernized marketing campaigns and strategies impacts the financial security of such organizations. Moreover, the utilization of optimal conversion-oriented digital marketing tools allows for a significant reduction in financial risks and an increase in the profitability of companies. The study further identified the future direction of global marketing development, which involves immersive strategies that deeply integrate and extensively use AI technologies. These strategies aim to enhance consumer interest and engagement. The practicality of this research lies in its ability to assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions and reducing the risks of misdirected investments.

"We develop a conceptual framework for collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing, providing systematic guidance for how human marketers and consumers can team up with AI, which has profound implications for retailing, which is the interface between marketers and consumers. Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived.

"The increasing use of digital technologies has significantly reshaped marketing and consumer behavior (CB) as online communities and cutting-edge innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupt and advance consumer attitudes on specific products and services. As such, online communities that are supported by AI technologies creating new knowledge from consumer interactions through platforms like social media as consumers share experiences on specific products or services. Since AI is designed to &#x201C;learn&#x201D; and improve with data generated from digital technologies linked to consumer interactions, AI relies on consumer knowledge-sharing (KS) activities to replicate new knowledge for product and service improvement. However, given the knowledge gap in this area, this article applies the fsQCA technique to data generated from 291 participants to develop CB metaframework predicted on the concepts of AI, CB, and KS. Our results suggest that AI advances consumer attitudes and behaviors when knowledge is acquired while online communities promote curiosity and engage consumers to learn by sharing experiences about specific products or services. Furthermore, understanding the causality between AI, CB, and KS concepts offers critical decision-making insights to marketing experts across the industry.

"In this article we develop a comprehensive understanding of diverse representation in advertising. While numerous studies highlight increasing demand for diversity among some consumers, such enthusiasm is not universal. This is creating challenges for brands, some of which have faced backlash, either due to a perceived lack of authenticity in their diversity efforts or because not all consumer groups value diversity equally. Amidst these challenges, technological advancements, such as data-driven decision-making and generative AI, present both new opportunities and risks. The current literature on diverse representation in advertising, although expansive, is relatively siloed. Through a detailed eight-step process, we assess and synthesize the body of literature on diversity representation, reviewing 337 articles spanning research on age, beauty, body size, gender, LGBTQIA+ , physical and mental ability, and race and ethnicity. Our investigation offers two major contributions: a summarization of insights from the broader literature on these seven key areas of diverse representation and development of an integrated conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework details mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes that are either prevalent across the literature or can be reasonably expected to generalize across other forms of diversity.

"Purpose: This paper aims to document how AI has changed the way consumers make decisions and propose how that change impacts services marketing, service research and service management. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings: Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers’ decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications: In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model.

"There is a growing debate amongst academics and practitioners on whether interventions made, thus far, towards Responsible AI have been enough to engage with the root causes of AI problems. Failure to effect meaningful changes in this system could see these initiatives not reach their potential and lead to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their marketing campaigns. Systems thinking is often touted as a methodology to manage and effect change; however, there is little practical advice available for decision-makers to include systems thinking insights to work towards Responsible AI. Using the notion of ‘leverage zones’ adapted from the systems thinking literature, we suggest a novel approach to plan for and experiment with potential initiatives and interventions. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the Five Ps to help practitioners construct and identify holistic interventions that may work towards Responsible AI, from lower-order interventions such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating parameters, through to higher-order interventions such as redefining the system’s foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in the first place.

"Extant communication theories predate the explosion of digital formats and technological advances such as virtual reality, which likely explains their predominant focus on traditional and format-level (e.g., face-to-face, email) rather than digital or characteristic-level (e.g., visual cues, synchronicity) design decisions. Firms thus lack insights into how to create and use emerging digital formats, individually or synergistically. To establish a holistic framework of bilateral multiformat communication for relationship marketing, this article reviews communication theory to establish a foundation for understanding multiformat communication and to identify any gaps (e.g., AI agents, simulated cues). The authors then review bilateral communication research in light of the identified theoretical gaps, to inform their framework. Finally, by decomposing these formats according to six fundamental characteristics, they predict how each characteristic might promote effective, efficient, and experiential communication goals, in light of distinct message, temporal, and dyadic factors. Ultimately, these combined insights reveal an overarching framework, with characteristic-level propositions grouped into five key themes, that can serve as a platform for academics and managers to develop multiformat communication theory and relationship strategies. © 2020, Academy of Marketing Science.",Moffett J.W.; Folse J.A.G.; Palmatier R.W.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-020-00750-2,Communication strategy; Multichannel communication; Multiformat communication; Online relationships; Simulated cues,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the establishment of a holistic framework for multiformat communication in relationship marketing, emphasizing long-term insights and strategies for combining emerging digital formats.

"Purpose: The paper aims to present a three-step approach that enables companies to define and quantify what customers value, systematically deploy their resources to deliver greater value than the competition, and capture a greater share of the value delivered to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Each of the three the three steps in the value creation cycle is examined, and the tools and approaches that leading companies use to maximize shareholder wealth are outlined. Findings: A customer-value based approach to management can help companies instill a fact-based decision-making process in the enterprise. This promotes faster growth through differentiated customer investment. It ensures that the highest return initiatives are prioritized. Enterprises using this disciplined three-step approach will be well positioned to better understand value potential, creating value, delivering value, and managing their market position to maximize the value they capture. Originality/value: Mastering the value cycle enables enterprises to win in both the customer markets and the financial markets. In short, it leads them to long-term profitable growth. Take the example of a commercial printer which had traditionally played in the procure and produce step of the print value chain associated with retail inserts. Retail inserts are one of the primary demand generation vehicles for retailers, who use these to drive store traffic. One retailer saw their store traffic drop by 20 percent over a one-month period after they decided to stop printing inserts. In this value chain print was fast becoming a commodity and, like its competitors, the company was looking for growth strategy amidst declining margins. An analysis of the value chain (see Table AI) revealed that while the print component of the value chain was fast being commoditized, value was pooling at the front of the value chain with the players who delivered the insert to the end customers. The pain experienced by the retailers was so high that they committed to co-developing a solution that would introduce a discontinuity in the value chain and redirect the pooling of value back to other participants of the value chain. The printer managed to escape the commodity trap and position itself towards profitable growth. Ashish Kothari is a Principal with Charter Consulting.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Ma L.; Sun B.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.04.005,Artificial intelligence (AI); Big data; Digital marketing; Interpretation; Machine learning; Marketing theory; Network; Prediction; Tracking data; Unstructured data,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of integrating machine learning methods into marketing research, outlining a multi-faceted research agenda and proposing research priorities that influence the overall direction of marketing practices.

"Purpose – This study aims to report on an investigation into decision-making leading to a UK firm’s first export order. It demonstrates the application of appreciative inquiry (AI) as an underutilised research method in marketing investigations. Design/methodology/approach – An AI research approach was undertaken in a firm that had not started exporting at the commencement of the study whereby the interventionist approach allowed the management team to overcome negative perceptions in their decision-making. From a research perspective, marketing decision-making could be understood in real time as opposed to in hindsight. Findings – While the key decision-maker is likely to be the owner/manager in small newly internationalising firms, a variety of factors will affect the decision to start exporting including the influence of the management team. In particular, the management team’s perceptions towards a combination of effectuation- and causation-based decision-making where risk/reward considerations in exploiting various international marketing opportunities are undertaken in light of perceived affordable losses, as well as against evolving objectives. Originality/value – The contribution is to demonstrate the AI methodology, which to date has received attention in management domains other than marketing; it offers an interventionist approach to help managers overcome barriers and move positively forward in decision-making. It offers researchers an opportunity to understand marketing decision-making in real time. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Crick D.; Crick J.,Strategic,10.1108/QMR-01-2015-0001,Appreciative inquiry; Export; Internationalisation; Marketing,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The study focuses on decision-making processes related to a firm's first export order, which involves long-term strategic planning and overcoming barriers in international marketing.

"Purpose: The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Wamba-Taguimdje S.-L.; Fosso Wamba S.; Kala Kamdjoug J.R.; Tchatchouang Wanko C.E.,Strategic,10.1108/BPMJ-10-2019-0411,Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the influence of AI on firm performance and the business value of AI-enabled transformation projects, focusing on long-term organizational goals and capabilities, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-ai,60,20,Influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on firm performance: the business value of AI-based transformation projects,2020
"This study investigates the strategic alignment between marketing and information technology (IT) strategies and provides production and operations decision makers a model for improving operational performance. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the combined strategies were used to develop a novel decision-making framework. The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making. The use of a novel three-phase decision-making framework which uses AI processes improves operational efficiency, increases insights and enhances the decision accuracy of complex problems at the strategic level in industries such as manufacturing. It could help operations executives to apply effective decisions. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Purpose: In spite of the merits of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and social media, harm to consumers has prompted calls for AI auditing/certification. Understanding consumers’ approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies’ choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media. Findings: Trust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most. Research limitations/implications: The introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars. Practical implications: For businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on “who should certify AI” from a consumer perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first to introduce the topic of AI certification to the marketing/social media literature, provide a novel guideline to scholars and offer the first set of empirical studies examining consumer approval of AI certifications. © 2023, Myrthe Blösser and Andrea Weihrauch.",Blösser M.; Weihrauch A.,Strategic,10.1108/EJM-01-2023-0009,AI certification; AI regulation; Artificial intelligence; Consumer trust; Fair AI,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The study explores consumer perspectives on AI certification and its implications for businesses and policymakers, aligning with long-term organizational goals and strategic decision-making.",scopus-ai,60,20,"A consumer perspective of AI certification – the current certification landscape, consumer approval and directions for future research",2024

"High-performance computational resources and artificial intelligence-based tools can enhance tourism research and marketing. However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques.

"While organizational frontlines in the digital age involve complex interactions between consumers, autonomous technology (AT), and frontline workers, research so far largely focuses on the effect of AT on either the consumer or the worker. Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)",van Doorn J.; Smailhodzic E.; Puntoni S.; Li J.; Schumann J.H.; Holthöwer J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114000,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service,10.0,,15,5,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects long-term implications and interactions between consumers, autonomous technology, and workers in organizational settings.

"Learning outcomes: After completion of the case study, students will be able to understand organic farming challenges in India, analyze Two Brothers Organic Farms’ (TBOF) value chain for creating shared values, evaluate marketing mix and product development strategies, explore social media’s impact on marketing and explore and propose strategies for long-term sustainability in the organic farming industry. Case overview/synopsis: The case study revolves around the entrepreneurial journey of Ajinkya and Satyajit Hange, two brothers who transitioned from successful banking careers to pursue their passion for organic farming. Establishing TBOF in Pune, India, the duo faced challenges in introducing organic produce to a market resistant to change. With a commitment to regenerative agriculture, they implemented innovative farming practices, including desi cow rearing, multicropping and indigenous seeds. The narrative unfolds the brothers’ strategic roles, where Ajinkya manages crop production, and Satyajit focuses on marketing. Emphasizing a trusted brand built on quality, they expanded their product portfolio (Figure 2), reaching 52 countries through direct marketing and word of mouth. As the organic food industry surged postpandemic, TBPF faced challenges in meeting rising demand. The case study discusses the organic farming sector in India, underscoring the brothers’ efforts to combat harmful agro-inputs. The dilemmas lie in navigating the niche organic market, supply–demand imbalances and the need for sustainable business processes. The case study aims to explore the strategic decisions and dilemmas encountered by TBOF, offering insights into the complexities of sustainable entrepreneurship in the Indian organic farming sector.

"We conducted a study to understand the factors affecting farmers' decisions to use computer-based technologies (CBT) so that feasible and farmer-friendly CBT can be developed as farm-decision support systems to improve farm productivity and sustainability. We analyzed data from 314 mail and in-person interview surveys from farmers in Kentucky, USA. We used a logistic regression model to identify sociodemographic factors influencing the adoption of CBT in farm management, production, and marketing by Kentucky farmers. Results suggest that the higher the farmer's education level, the more likely they will use CBT. Younger farmers are more likely to use CBT than older farmers, and the more acres a farmer owns, the more likely they are to use CBT. The results could help improve education and outreach strategies to reach out to farmers with innovative farm management and marketing strategies. © 2023",Gyawali B.R.; Paudel K.P.; Jean R.; Banerjee S.“.,Strategic,10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102202,Adoption; Computer-based technologies (CBT); Farm management; Logistic regression; Regression; Small farms,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study aims to identify factors influencing the adoption of computer-based technologies (CBT) among farmers, which aligns with long-term strategic planning for improving farm productivity and sustainability.

"Virtual influencers have great potential to shape the audience's perception and motivate behavioral change. Drawing upon anthropomorphism theory and social identity theory, this paper examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in shaping audiences' trust and subsequently pro-environmental behaviors in low- and high-cost contexts. Two online studies employing experimental materials generated by artificial intelligence were conducted. Study 1 revealed that high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) and high racial homophily (local-like virtual influencers) are more effective for eliciting trust in the context of low-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) would further weaken the trust level of a virtual influencer in low anthropomorphism (animate-like virtual influencers). Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in the context of high-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) enhanced the trust in a high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) virtual influencer. The moderated mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. This research advanced our understanding on the moderating role of racial homophily that serves as a cognitive shortcut for low-cost and quick decisions. However, a low racial homophily (foreign-like) virtual influencer would be more effective for high-cost and symbolic pro-environmental behaviors. These insights provide valuable guidance to businesses, marketers, and environmental advocates aiming to leverage virtual influencers for encouraging sustainability practices. © 2024 The Authors.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the effect of marketing modification on business performance from the perspective of marketing capabilities theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) – path analysis. Findings: According to the study’s findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: This current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implications: The outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implications: The application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/value: The study’s findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP). In terms of contribution, this study adds to the body of knowledge already available on marketing modification and business performance, particularly in the setting of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Abrokwah-Larbi K.; Awuku-Larbi Y.,Strategic,10.1108/JRME-01-2022-0010,Business performance; Food processing SMEs; Ghana; Marketing modification,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study examines the long-term impact of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs, aligning with strategic goals such as financial performance, customer performance, and overall business growth.

"With the growing use of artificial intelligence, search engine providers are increasingly pushing advertisers to use automated bidding strategies based on machine learning. Such automated decision-making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision-making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long-term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference-in-differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self-regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision-making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps. © 2023 The Authors.

Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers. This paper shows that with the right ‘business translator’ — that is, a person or team operating as the ‘glue’ between data science and business performance — sophisticated data science becomes accessible to commercial teams looking to drive performance improvements. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

"Over the last decade, the importance of machine learning increased dramatically in business and marketing. However, when machine learning is used for decision-making, bias rooted in unrepresentative datasets, inadequate models, weak algorithm designs, or human stereotypes can lead to low performance and unfair decisions, resulting in financial, social, and reputational losses. This paper offers a systematic, interdisciplinary literature review of machine learning biases as well as methods to avoid and mitigate these biases. We identified eight distinct machine learning biases, summarized these biases in the cross-industry standard process for data mining to account for all phases of machine learning projects, and outline twenty-four mitigation methods. We further contextualize these biases in a real-world case study and illustrate adequate mitigation strategies. These insights synthesize the literature on machine learning biases in a concise manner and point to the importance of human judgment for machine learning algorithms. © 2022 The Authors",van Giffen B.; Herhausen D.; Fahse T.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.01.076,Artificial intelligence; Bias; Case study; Machine learning; Mitigation methods,10.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract addresses the long-term implications of machine learning biases in decision-making processes, emphasizing the importance of human judgment and proposing systematic methods for mitigation, which aligns with strategic planning in organizations.",scopus-artificial intelligence,60,20,Overcoming the pitfalls and perils of algorithms: A classification of machine learning biases and mitigation methods,2022
"Purpose: In the context of global economic downturn and intense competition, firms are increasingly resorting to supply chains to acquire capital support and achieve sustainability. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP – namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) – the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF’s effects on CSP. Findings: The authors find that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP’s positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF’s promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implications: This study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF’s effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF’s role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain – namely, core firm–suppliers and core firm–customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implications: First, our findings indicate that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to “do good.” The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/value: This study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm’s competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Wang S.; Yu H.; Wei M.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,Environmental; Financial performance; Recipe; social and governance performance; Supply chain finance; Sustainability performance,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The study explores the long-term implications of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP), aligning with strategic planning that defines organizational goals and nature.

"The new chatbot from artificial intelligence company OpenAI, called ChatGPT, has grown aggressively since its launch in late 2022. ChatGPT provides information back to users who populate questions in a clear and easy to understand structure. This technology can be used for different purposes, including writing code, creating business proposals, writing stories and answering complex questions. Because this technology is considered a breakthrough in terms of its ability to process natural language, it stands to reason that it could have future effects on the fundamental digital marketing tactic known as search engine optimisation (SEO), a process by which websites are developed and updated with the goal of increasing natural ranking, traffic and customers from search engines like Google and Bing. For the past 20 years, people have turned to search engines for information, news articles, images, videos and answers to questions both mundane and complex. This technological advance with chatbots could indicate a significant general shift for marketers, specifically related to web searches and how marketers think about SEO. In fact, Microsoft’s decision to invest in ChatGPT and include it within their search engine, Bing, has already created waves in the search engine ecosystems. In this paper, ChatGPT will be examined, its capabilities and how they could affect search marketing and SEO. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Cutler K.,Strategic,,chat bots; ChatGPT; digital marketing; search engine marketing; search engine optimisation; search marketing; SEO,5.0,,10,0,Henry Stewart Publications,"The abstract discusses the implications of ChatGPT on digital marketing strategies, particularly focusing on SEO and future marketing environments, which aligns with long-term planning and organizational goals.",scopus-artificial intelligence,60,25,Practice papers ChatGPT and search engine optimisation: The future is here,2023
"Innovative technologies often feature inherently conflicting properties. This poses a challenge for marketers because negative properties not only weigh heavily on consumers' technology adoption decisions but potentially do more so than positive ones. To shed light on the paradox of technology and its underlying processes, the present research develops a conceptual model drawing on technology adoption and valence perception theories about the prevalence of negativity bias in consumers' technology adoption decisions with its unique effect through the serial chain of consumers' perceptions of risk and trust regarding the technology. Results of three studies (N = 1309) demonstrate that the effect of negative valence consistently outperforms that of positive valence in consumers' technology adoption intentions (Studies 1–2) and decisions (Study 3). Furthermore, results show that the disproportionate effect of negative (vs. positive) valence can be explained by the proposed serial causal chain through consumers' perception of risk of the technology and trust in the technology (Studies 2–3) while ruling out company trust and consumer knowledge as alternative drivers of the effects (Study 3). These findings contribute to the pertinent literature on consumer psychology in decisions to adopt novel technologies in that they quantify and explain the potential outcome stemming from the ambiguous properties of novel technology. Moreover, this study finds negativity bias to be an often overlooked consumer bias with implications for marketing practice and useful for understanding and lowering resistance towards artificial intelligence technology. © 2022 The Authors.

"The consumer decision journey model has become increasingly important to understand consumer decision-making processes. Although the term originally emerged with Court et al. in 2009, the various current perspectives of the consumer journey suggest the existence of distinct literature and theoretical roots that have yet to be fully explored in detail. The objective of the paper is to semi-systematically review the main theories and models that constitute the foundation on which the consumer journey has evolved. Furthermore, given the lack of academic studies reflecting on the influence of more recent technologies based on artificial intelligence on the consumer journey, this study aims to fill this gap in an attempt to mold further theory development around the consumer journey concept. 74 relevant papers were retrieved mainly from a detailed search on SCOPUS, as well as a backward and forward citation analysis. A thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three literature streams that contribute to the consumer journey literature. This represents a furthering of the theoretical knowledge regarding the consumer journey and its foundations. By also discussing a future perspective, a holistic and comprehensive basis is provided to structure and assist how marketing managers can perceive the consumer decision journey. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Santos S.; Gonçalves H.M.,Strategic,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121117,Classical consumer behavior models; Consumer decision journey; Decision analysis; Hierarchy of effects; Semi-systematic literature review,5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the theoretical foundations of the consumer decision journey and aims to fill gaps in academic literature, indicating a focus on long-term understanding and implications for marketing managers.

"The prime concern of this study is to explore how technology influences entrepreneurial marketing decisions during the world pandemic (COVID-19). The study uses a sample of 127 SMEs from Bangladesh. Data were collected by sending out questionnaires electronically and by mail. Smart PLS (SEM) 3.0 was used to analyse the data following the quantitative method. The study reveals positive and significant relationships between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, opportunity development and opportunity exploitation with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. It also claims that entrepreneurial passion mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and opportunity development with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. However, entrepreneurial passion does not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation and entrepreneurial marketing decisions.

"As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it will increasingly empower the successful use of intelligent agent (IA) technologies in marketing practices. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer’s perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers’ intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Sidlauskiene J.,Strategic,10.1080/15332861.2021.1961192,Antecedents; artificial intelligence; intelligent agent technologies; representation theory; systematic literature review; technology acceptance,15.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The paper discusses the long-term implications of artificial intelligence in marketing practices, highlighting the need for a new theoretical framework to understand intelligent agent use.

"Worldwide investments in influencer marketing are growing and could reach US$ 101 billion in 2020. But how can the brands shield themselves from scandals and other limitations of human influencers? The solution for many companies has involved robots. Virtual influencers (VI) are virtual robots that can emulate human appearance and behaviour and have become a trend in marketing. This study analyses how non-human influencers affect marketing communication by adopting two methods that are unpublished in the investigation of this phenomenon: a systematic literature review and netnography in conjunction with in-depth interviews with specialists resulting in the study identifying five categories (two of which are unpublished and unexplored in the literature) that can facilitate management decisions and also future studies around VIs: anthropomorphism/humanization, attractiveness, authenticity, scalability, and controllability.

"Technological advances are increasing the connections between customers and companies, products, and one another. Consumers’ use of connected devices is providing rich sources of data about consumers, their activity, and their environment, which we collectively label customer intelligence. At the same time, changes in statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence are making automated inferences and decisions regarding consumer behavior possible. One likely result of these changes is the emergence of companies that are especially adept at generating and using customer intelligence. This article explores how changes in sensing technology, causal modeling, and intelligent marketing platforms may affect the generation and utilization of customer intelligence. We envision a merging of these tradition-ally separate activities in companies that possess a large, active customer base and the ability to collect, process, and apply data from these customers quickly and accurately.

"In recent years, firms have focused on how to enter markets and meet customer requirements by improving product attributes and processes to boost their market share and profits. Consequently, market-driven product design and development has become a popular topic in the literature. However, past research neither covers all of the major influencing factors that together drive customers to make purchase decisions, nor connects these various influencing factors to customer purchasing behavior. Past studies further fail to take the time value of money and customer value into consideration. This study proposes a decision support system to (a) predict customer purchasing behavior given certain product, customer, and marketing influencing factors, and (b) estimate the net customer lifetime value from customer purchasing behavior toward a specific product. This will not only enable decision-makers to compare alternatives and select competitive products to launch on the market, but will also improve the understanding of customer behavior toward particular products for the formulation of effective marketing strategies that increase customer loyalty and generate greater profits in the long term. Decision-makers can also make use of the system to build up confidence in new product development in terms of idea generation and product improvement. The application of the proposed system is illustrated and confirmed to be sensible and convincing through a case study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"The proper location of branch-banks is critical to the success of the banking business. The major ingredients for deciding where to locate branch-banks are: growth rates of deposits and loans; degree of competition; easy accessibility, and operating costs of potential sites. These are often highly sensitive to socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that are ill-defined and fuzzy in nature. Accordingly, the traditional normative approach alone cannot analyze the excessive location-related data associated with the external factors and cannot appropriately evaluate behavioral criteria for branch-bank sites. In order to overcome these difficulties, this paper develops an interactive fuzzy goal programming model embedded within a locational decision support system for branch-banks.

"Marketing plays an essential role in the competitive business environment. Marketing decision makers constantly need to monitor changes in the environment and organization to make necessary changes. Therefore, a knowledge management (KM) system is required to acquire, store, retrieve and use up-to-date knowledge. Corporations also tend to look for systems to assist them in knowledge management. Agent technology looks set for assisting organizations in collecting, processing and using knowledge with high accuracy, speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for marketing decision making through using agent technology, fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy AHP is used for allocating the weight of determinant criteria and fuzzy logic is deployed for determining the final decision in pessimistic, moderate and optimistic satiations. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) developing a knowledge management framework for capturing, storing, disseminating and utilizing marketing knowledge by using agent system, and (b) helping marketing decision makers to make effective decisions based on useful knowledge, and (c) encouraging marketing decisions towards the intelligence.

"Brands are one of the most important of a firm's assets. Brand-managing activities are typically related to brand positioning and integration with marketing campaigns, and can involve complex decisions. The branding of an organization is indeed a dynamic system with many cause-effect relationships as well as intangible and heterogeneous variables. In order to help brand managers and marketers, we propose a decision support system, named Identimod, for modeling and evaluating branding strategies. Identimod uses non-linear dynamic modeling and soft computing to identify the branding system from different data sources through a linguistic user interface, and to provide advanced methods for diagnostics and validation. Identimod steps through a participatory, cyclic, and iterative process consisting of four different modules to increase the confidence and validity of the model, which should facilitate its acceptance by managers and stakeholders.

"In the era of digitalisation, e-commerce retail sites have become decisive channels for reaching millions of potential customers worldwide. Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products.

"In its introduction this paper discusses why marketing professionals do not make satisfactory use of the marketing models posed by academics in their studies. The main body of this research is characterised by the proposal of a brand new and complete methodology for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), to be applied in marketing causal modelling and with utilities to be used as a marketing management decision support tool. Such methodology is based on Genetic Fuzzy Systems, a specific hybridization of artificial intelligence methods, highly suited to the research problem we face. The use of KDD methodologies based on intelligent systems like this can be considered as an avant-garde evolution, exponent nowadays of the so-called knowledge-based Marketing Management Support Systems; we name them as Marketing Intelligent Systems. The most important questions to the KDD process-i.e. pre-processing; machine learning and post-processing-are discussed in depth and solved. After its theoretical presentation, we empirically experiment with it, using a consumer behaviour model of reference.

"Marketing via internet becomes more popular and common since the development of internet service is mature. Nowadays, most companies have their own websites to promote their company products and services aiming at developing their business. To recognise macromarketing trends and real-time customers’ needs, contents in customer websites are valuable asset. However, different semantic patterns used in various parties may have great challenges in the comprehension of the content in the website. Moreover, organisational sales transaction system such as Management Information System (MIS) can help to determine sales performance of well-known customers. However, the customer information can only be part of the marketing information. As a result, this paper presents a Web Semantic Network Analysis (WSNA) approach for business intelligence. A prototype of an agent-based web Business Intelligence System (BIS) is established based on the WSNA approach. By adopting and integrating semantic network, agent technology, rule-based decision support system and scoring technique, the marking and sale performance information can be captured, clustered, compared, analysed, integrated and disseminated. This leverages organisational marketing capital to support marketing plan and shorten the promotion planning time. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Lam Li F.; Fai Cheung C.; Bun Lee W.; Kwok S.K.,Strategic,10.1504/ijenm.2007.012758,agent technology; artificial intelligence; business intelligence; knowledge management; semantic network,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a Web Semantic Network Analysis (WSNA) approach for business intelligence, which aligns with long-term organizational goals in marketing by leveraging information systems and decision support to improve overall marketing strategies.",scopus-artificial intelligence,60,25,Business intelligence for new market development: a web semantic network analysis approach,2007
"Artificial intelligence and, especially expert or knowledge systems, hold the promise of changing and improving business-to-business marketing activities and marketing decision support systems. Understanding what expert systems are, knowing the kinds of problems to which they can be applied, and knowing how and what it takes to implement them are the subjects of this article.

"Nowadays opinion mining systems play a strategic role in different areas such as Marketing, Decision Support Systems or Policy Support. Since the arrival of the Web 2.0, more and more textual documents containing information that express opinions or comments in different languages are available. Given the proven importance of such documents, the use of effective multilingual opinion mining systems has become of high importance to different fields. This paper presents the experiments carried out with the objective to develop a multilingual sentiment analysis system. We present initial evaluations of methods and resources performed in two international evaluation campaigns for English and for Spanish. After our participation in both competitions, additional experiments were carried out with the aim of improving the performance of both Spanish and English systems by using multilingual machine-translated data. Based on our evaluations, we show that the use of hybrid features and multilingual, machine-translated data (even from other languages) can help to better distinguish relevant features for sentiment classification and thus increase the precision of sentiment analysis systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"The pricing strategy predominantly used in construction is cost based. But this pricing logic may lead to the underpricing or overpricing of a bid offer. In response to this problem, alternate pricing strategies are proposed in this paper that make use of market-based approaches. These models are centered on marketing intelligence functions. In this paper, marketing intelligence systems developed and used in manufacturing industries are explored, including marketing research, marketing information systems, and decision support systems. The current developments and practices of marketing intelligence in construction are reviewed. The findings of a survey that investigates the marketing intelligence and pricing strategy practices of the largest 400 U.S. contractors are presented. In conclusion, it is discovered that contractors use mostly traditional marketing intelligence strategies. It is recommended that contractors develop computerized intelligence activities such as using resources on the Internet and developing management information systems and decision support systems.

"Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of multi-agent theory, offer great promises in modeling strategic planning processes. In this domain, the ability to introduce distinct cognitive agents which cooperate to solve the problem enables the processing of more complex and ill-structured problems. This paper presents a general framework for building a distributed strategic decision support system (DSDSS) which integrates both advances in distributed decision making and distributed artificial intelligence. It goes on to describe a cooperative and distributed system with two specific features: the users intervene as human agents in the solution formation, and strategic knowledge and domain knowledge are distributed in different agents which communicate through various blackboards and message passing.

"The Internet is quickly changing the way business-to-consumer and business-to-business commerce is conducted in the world. The Electronic Revolution has also spawned a trend of price wars and, in some instances, chaos, because of the zero-sum nature of the electronic channel. The technology has created an opportunity to get beyond the lose-lose nature of single issue price wars by determining sellers' and buyers' preferences across multiple issues and encouraging negotiations, thereby creating possible joint gains for all parties.

"Learning outcomes: Students learn to evaluate a firm’s growth strategies with the aim of establishing long-term business sustainability. Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm’s offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term.

"Neuromanagement is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that intersects neuroscience and social science. It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

"Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous, able to make decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Whereas the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human–machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human–computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey.

"Knowledge is an important resource for successful decision-making process in the whole society today. The special procedures of control and management of knowledge therefore have to be used. In the area of knowledge management and knowledge engineering basic terms of these disciplines are data, information, knowledge and knowledge transformation. The knowledge can be defined as a dynamic human process of justifying personal beliefs. Knowledge is a product of successful decision-making process. Knowledge transformation is a spiralling process of interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge that leads to the new knowledge. Nonaka and al (2000) show, that the combination of these two categories makes possible to conceptualise four conversion steps: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation (SECI model). Another model of knowledge creation is the Knowledge Transformation Continuum (BCI Knowledge Group) that begins with the articulation of a specific instruction representing the best way that a specific task, or series of tasks, should be performed. Knowledge modelling and knowledge representation is an important field of research also in Computer Science andArtificial Intelligence. The definition of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is a noticeable different, because Artificial Intelligence is typically dealing with formalized knowledge (e.g. ontology). The development of knowledge-based systems was seen as a process of transferring human knowledge to an implemented knowledge base. Decision Support Systems (DSS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) modelling process support decision-making process, therefore they also produce a new knowledge. A Decision Support Systems are an interactive computer-based systems helping decision makers complete decision process. Geographic Information Systems provide essential marketing and customer intelligence solutions that lead to better business decisions. Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) is methodology based on system theory and theory of modelling. The OR/MS models serve for better quantification and precision of decision-making process. In this contribution the role of DSS, GIS and OR/MS models in the process of knowledge creation will be explained. The tacit or explicit character of this knowledge and the process of its creation will be explained and discussed. © 2009, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

"Although the concept of viewing knowledge as a critical resource has been widely accepted in prior studies, it is not fully understood how to acquire available knowledge in order to improve organizational effectiveness. However, it is sure that organizational knowledge management should pursue the achievement of the business goal by delivering relevant and useful information to the right person at the right time. Group Support Systems (GSS) can play an important role in transfering scattered information into meaningful business knowledge for supporting strategic corporate decision-making. This study proposes a fuzzy GSS framework for acquiring workgroup knowledge from individual memory and aggregating workgroup knowledge into organizational knowledge. This study also proposes an architecture to support the fuzzy GSS framework. The architecture consists of user agents, information management agents, and a fuzzy model manager. To illustrate how the fuzzy GSS framework can be used to support the whole process of organizational knowledge acquisition, an Internet-based GSS was developed and applied in a marketing decision process. It showed that the framework was effective for acquiring organizational knowledge. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"While complacency is the most commonly offered explanation for the lack of strategic change among successful firms, research in management psychology suggests otherwise. Based on regulatory focus theory, we propose that competitive success prompts an increased sense of responsibility in managers, causing them to assume a defensive attitude and to concentrate on preserving the status quo instead of becoming complacent. Data collected from the Markstrat simulation support our predictions. The findings imply that efforts to encourage strategic change by pressurizing managers will backfire, because they will aggravate managers' defensive attitude. Instead, firms should loosen the pressure on managers and allow them to experiment with innovative strategies. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Rusetski A.; Lim L.K.S.,Strategic,10.1080/0965254X.2011.557743,decision making; marketing strategy; Markstrat; regulatory focus; strategic inertia,15.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the implications of managerial behavior towards strategic change in successful firms, suggesting that competitive success leads to a defensive attitude that preserves the status quo.

"The goal of this research is to help understand the difference between satisfaction and loyalty based on the nature of the judgment tasks involved. By drawing on the notion of the prediction- decision inconsistency, we posit satisfaction as a consumption/experience utility and loyalty as a decision utility to explain the missing link between satisfaction and loyalty. An important assumption that may be driving the prediction-decision inconsistency, but has not been addressed, is the different criteria that consumers use in arriving at the two different types of utilities. The authors argue that this difference affects the compatibility, and resulting influence, of quality versus price information on satisfaction and loyalty evaluations. An empirical study of 183 firms using data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index is reported which supports the proposed compatibility effects. Implications for marketing theory and practice are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate how opportunity for control and firm capability interact to moderate the amount of risk that managers associate with various international entry-mode strategies. A secondary goal is to investigate how managers perceive the need to retain control over three core functional areas (marketing, production, and R&D) when making entry-mode decisions. Design/methodology/approach - A field experiment design was implemented in a sample of US business owner/executives. Using an online data collection method, the study asked a sample of small-business owners and managers to assess the amount of risk they associated with three modes of entering the Japanese market: non-ownership (export), equal partnership (50/50 joint-venture), and sole-ownership. They were also asked how much control they needed to retain over R&D, production, and marketing for the venture to be successful. Findings - Ownership-provided control interacts with capability to influence managerial risk perceptions. Managers in lower-capability firms see the least risk in the non-ownership entry mode while those in higher-capability firms see the least risk in the equal-partnership entry mode. Managers believe that for a new venture in a foreign market to be successful, control should be retained over the R&D function, regardless of entry mode. Research limitations/implications - The findings appear to reconcile some of the conflicting predictions of the transaction cost and resource-based theoretical perspectives, because it appears that international managers consider both control (internationalization theory) and capability (resource-based theory) when judging the perceived risk of an entry strategy. Practical implications - For firms that are incapable of managing in an international context, a low-control no-ownership entry mode is perceived as the least risky approach; for firms that have some capability for international management, then a partial-ownership mode such as a 50/50 joint-venture is perceived as having lower risk than no-ownership. In non-ownership and joint-venture type entry modes, managers are more apt to outsource the marketing function to an agent/partner, but not R&D. In contrast, managers believe that marketing needs to be maintained in-house when utilizing a sole-ownership entry mode. Originality/value - By illustrating the role of perceived risk in foreign-market entry-mode decisions and demonstrating how capabilities interact with ownership-provided control to moderate these perceptions, the paper's findings suggest that managers' risk perceptions may mediate the effects of firm-specific factors, and thus contributes significantly to both theory and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Forlani D.; Parthasarathy M.; Keaveney S.M.,Strategic,10.1108/02651330810877225,Japan; Market entry; Marketing decision making; Overseas trade; Risk management; Small enterprises,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses how managers perceive and manage risks associated with international market entry strategies, which involves long-term planning and decision-making related to the firm's strategic goals and capabilities.",scopus-prediction,70,15,Managerial risk perceptions of international entry-mode strategies: The interaction effect of control and capability,2008
"Consumers' attempts to control their unwanted consumption impulses influence many everyday purchases with broad implications for marketers' pricing policies. Addressing theoreticians and practitioners alike, this paper uses multiple empirical methods to show that consumers voluntarily and strategically ration their purchase quantities of goods that are likely to be consumed on impulse and that therefore may pose self-control problems. For example, many regular smokers buy their cigarettes by the pack, although they could easily afford to buy 10-pack cartons. These smokers knowingly forgo sizable per-unit savings from quantity discounts, which they could realize if they bought cartons; by rationing their purchase quantities, they also self-impose additional transactions costs on marginal consumption, which makes excessive smoking overly difficult and costly. Such strategic self-imposition of constraints is intuitively appealing yet theoretically problematic. The marketing literature lacks operationalizations and empirical tests of such consumption self-control strategies and of their managerial implications. This paper provides experimental evidence of the operation of consumer self-control and empirically illustrates its direct implications for the pricing of consumer goods. Moreover, the paper develops a conceptual frame-work for the design of empirical tests of such self-imposed constraints on consumption in consumer goods markets. Within matched pairs of products, we distinguish relative ""virtue"" and ""vice"" goods whose preference ordering changes with whether consumers evaluate immediate or delayed consumption consequences. For example, ignoring long-term health effects, many smokers prefer regular (relative vice) to light (relative virtue) cigarettes, because they prefer the taste of the former. However, ignoring these short-term taste differences, the same smokers prefer light to regular cigarettes when they consider the long-term health effects of smoking. These preference orders can lead to dynamically inconsistent consumption choices by consumers whose tradeoffs between the immediate and delayed consequences of consumption depend on the time lag between purchase and consumption. This creates a potential self-control problem, because these consumers will be tempted to overconsume the vices they have in stock at home. Purchase quantity rationing helps them solve the self-control Problem by limiting their stock and hence their consumption opportunities. Such rationing implies that, per purchase occasion, vice consumers will be less likely than virtue consumers to buy larger quantities in response to unit price reductions such as quantity discounts. We first test this prediction in two laboratory experiments. We then examine the external validity of the results at the retail level with a field survey of quantity discounts and with a scanner data analysis of chain-wide store-level demand across a variety of different pairs of matched vice (regular) and virtue (reduced fat, calorie, or caffeine, etc.) product categories. The analyses of these experimental, field, and scanner data provide strong convergent evidence of a characteristic crossover in demand schedules for relative vices and virtues for categories as diverse as, among others, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, cream cheese, beer, soft drinks, ice cream and frozen yogurt, chewing gum, coffee, and beef and turkey bologna. Vice consumers' demand increases less in response to price reductions than virtue consumers' demand, although their preferences are not generally weaker for vices than for virtues. Constraints on vice purchases are self-imposed and strategic rather than driven by simple preferences. We suggest that rationing their vice inventories at the point of purchase allows consumers to limit subsequent consumption. As a result of purchase quantity rationing, however, vice buyers forgo savings from price reductions through quantity discounts, effectively paying price premiums for the opportunity to engage in self-control. Thus, purchase quantity rationing vice consumers are relatively price insensitive. From a managerial and public policy perspective, our findings should offer marketing practitioners in many consumer goods industries new opportunities to increase profits through segmentation and price discrimination based on consumer self-control. They can charge premium prices for small sizes of vices, relative to the corresponding quantity discounts for virtues. Virtue consumers, on the other hand, will buy larger amounts even when quantity discounts are relatively shallow. A key conceptual contribution of this paper lies in showing how marketing researchers can investigate a whole class of strategic self-constraining consumer behaviors empirically. Moreover, this research is the first to extend previous, theoretical work on impulse control by empirically demonstrating its broader implications for marketing decision making.",Wertenbroch K.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.17.4.317,Intertemporal choice; Pricing policy; Product policy; Segmentation; Self-control,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses consumer self-control strategies and their implications for pricing policies, which involve long-term marketing decisions and consumer behavior analysis.

"Internet technology has allowed for a higher degree of decoupling between the information-intensive sales process and the physical process of inventory management than its brick-and-mortar counterpart. As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices. © 2006 INFORMS.",Randall T.; Netessine S.; Rudi N.,Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.1050.0493,Bankruptcy; Econometrics; Electronic commerce; Fulfillment; Hazard model; Internet; Retailing; Supply chain management,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of inventory management decisions in relation to e-commerce strategies and the overall economic success of Internet retailers.

"We construct two models of the behavior of consumers in an environment where there is uncertainty about brand attributes. In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ""forward-looking"" model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent. We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run. The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ""structural"" estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ""structural"" models. A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change. Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.",Erdem T.; Keane M.P.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.15.1.1,Advertising; Brand choice; Buyer Behavior; Choice Models; Econometric Modelling; Information Processing,5.0,,5,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses models of consumer behavior and their implications for long-term marketing strategies, emphasizing the importance of understanding brand choice probabilities and the long-term effects of advertising.

"The financial press and accounting regulators (e.g., the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Accounting Standards Board) have expressed concern about pressures on Internet firms to report high levels of revenue. This study verifies the association between market capitalization and revenue, and examines economic factors that potentially influence Internet company managers' decisions to adopt allegedly aggressive revenue-recognition policies. Specifically, we examine factors hypothesized to influence the reporting of advertising barter revenue and grossed-up sales levels. We begin by providing descriptive evidence on the use of barter and grossed-up revenue across Internet sectors. Although common in some sectors, we find that the use of these accounting policies is not pervasive overall. We limit our empirical analyses to Internet companies that have the opportunity to report grossed-up or advertising barter revenue. Our cross-sectional predictions are based on both external and internal incentives to maximize revenues as well as constraints that may limit management's discretion. We predict that the following factors increase the likelihood that a firm will report grossed-up and/or barter revenue: shorter time before needing additional external financing, more active individual investor interest in the firm's stock, more active pursuit of growth via acquisitions, and greater use of stock options in employee compensation. We also posit that barter transactions might be an inexpensive way for firms to evaluate the viability of future marketing or content alliances with potential partners. Finally, we predict that constraints on management discretion are related to the reputation/quality of the firm's auditor and underwriter and the extent of management ownership. We find that firms with greater cash burn rates and higher levels of activity on Motley Fool message boards are consistently associated with barter and grossed-up revenue reporting.",Bowen R.M.; Davis A.K.; Rajgopal S.,Strategic,10.1506/9728-4YG8-GC3L-FPFA,,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of revenue recognition policies and their influences on Internet firms, indicating a focus on long-term organizational goals and strategies regarding financial reporting and market capitalization.",scopus-prediction,60,20,Determinants of Revenue-Reporting Practices for Internet Firms,2002
"Historically, neither the creators nor the distributors of cultural products such as books or movies have used analytics - data, statistics, predictive modeling - to determine the likely success of their offerings. Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation. They then discuss two aspects of the prediction market. First, the need for better prediction for distributors of cultural products, and second, the potential for business models around prediction techniques.

The study's hypotheses are developed by integrating the motivational qualities of Weiner's attribution theory with the behavioral predictions of four popular risk perspectives: prospect theory, the hot-hand effect, the competency hypothesis, and risk as hazard. The research question is reflected in two sets of hypotheses that experimentally examine the relationship between valenced (was the outcome good or bad) attributions (why did the outcome happen) and changes in the riskiness (chance and size of loss) of managers' new-product introduction decisions.

"Transaction cost analysis (TCA) keeps the frequency of exchange as a significant dimension of business-to-business transactions, and the transaction frequency is expected to influence how to align inter-firm organization efficiently. To date, transaction frequency has received little attention in empirical TCA-studies. This research focuses in particular on order frequency in industrial purchasing relationships and how it affects the alignment of purchase contracting and hierarchical governance in supplier-manufacturer relationships. Data from a survey of 160 industrial purchasing relationships supports the basic TCA prediction stating that increased transaction frequency will provide administrative economies of scale benefits under conditions with substantial hazards of trade. The empirical findings demonstrate that the association between manufacturer-specific assets and formalized purchase contracting is highly dependent on the present level of exchange frequency. In manufacturer-supplier relationships with modest exchange frequency, there is no significant association between asset specificity and contractual governance. On the other hand, the effect of manufacturer-specific assets on formalized purchase contracting was substantial in relationships with high order frequency. This governance pattern was replicated in the analysis of hierarchical governance. Substantial investments in manufacturer-specific assets enforced the manufacturer's decision control over the supplier under conditions with high exchange frequency. The research provides further insight into the economics of inter-firm organization and supports the TCA-based assumption asserting that the frequency of inter-firm exchange improves the utilization of specialized governance arrangements in business to business relationships. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

"This paper has three objectives: (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model by observing how different market conditions influence whether companies emphasize marketing expertise. We accomplish these objectives as follows. First, we use decision theory to find an expression for the expected value of marketing expertise. We do not use decision-analysis in the normative tradition. Nor do we assume that firms actually use formal decision-analysis. Rather, we assume that firms are rational and that decision theory describes their actions. Given that assumption, we predict how firms should evaluate marketing. Here, marketing expertise helps a firm make better marketing decisions (at least on average). Hence, the value of marketing expertise increases as marketing decisions become more important. Second, consistent with decision theory, we predict that marketing decisions become more important with increases in the instability of the marketing environment (i.e., predictability), the profit impact of marketing decisions (i.e., opportunity profit), and the loss from marketing mistakes (i.e., potential loss). Third, we construct empirical measures of our theoretical constructs with data from 592 firms. Our empirical results are consistent with our predictions and reveal factors influencing the value of marketing expertise. For example, greater market instability and market presence increase the value of marketing expertise, while larger organization size, organization instability, and competition decrease its value.",Paşa M.; Shugan S.M.,Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.42.3.370,Decision Analysis; Expertise; Marketing; Value,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract focuses on constructing a theoretical model for evaluating marketing expertise and understanding its value in various market conditions, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and decision-making in marketing.",scopus-prediction,70,15,The value of marketing expertise,1996

"Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to new entries are recognized as important determinants of the outcome of pioneer-late mover competition, particularly in price-inelastic markets such as those for pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, and luxury goods. Managers in such markets are interested in better understanding when to accommodate (i.e., decrease marketing spending) or retaliate (i.e., increase spending) in nonprice marketing variables such as advertising and salesforce. In addition, the reallocation of marketing resources toward advertising (indicated by a pull strategy) or salesforce (indicated by a push strategy) upon entry is strategically important to managers. Previous theoretical research shows that pioneers should retaliate in both static and growing markets. Results from empirical research are mixed in that they support both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets. Empirical research also shows that a pioneer accommodates (retaliates) with its low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Contrary to prior research, however, some pioneers have successfully accommodated late movers in growing markets, and in some cases, have accommodated with their stronger marketing mix variables and also retaliated with their weaker marketing mix variables. For example, Bristol Myers Squibb's Capoten accommodated the entry of Merck's Vasotec in the growing ace-inhibitors market with its more powerful variable, salesforce, but also retaliated with its less potent variable, advertising. Moreover, not much is known about how the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should change (i.e., toward pull vs. push strategies) in response to new entries. We seek to better explain the pioneer's reactions and predict its shift in marketing mix allocation upon new entry. We note that prior research's predictions on the pioneer's reactions are based on a limited number of key factors such as product-market characteristics and the pioneer's elasticities prior to a new entry. In this paper, we extend previous research by adding two other critical factors, namely, the impact of new entry on the pioneer's elasticities and margin, and different competitive game structures to better predict and explain the pioneer's reactions. We develop analytical results on the pioneer's reactions in price, advertising, and salesforce in different competitive games (both Nash and different leader-follower games). In these results we identify the conditions under which the pioneer should accommodate, or retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift its marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies. We empirically illustrate some of the analytical results using data from a pharmaceutical category. We show that a pioneer who adopts a follower (leader) role with respect to a marketing mix variable in a static (growing) market, and witnesses a decrease (an increase) in own elasticity and margin upon a new entry, generally should accommodate (retaliate) in that variable. However, we are also able to show that there are cases where these general reactions don't hold. Thus, for example, it is possible for a pioneer to find it optimal to accommodate in a growing market or to retaliate even when its elasticity decreases upon entry, depending on the combination of competitive game, the impact of entry on elasticities and margin, and market growth. In this way, our results point to the fact that it is necessary to look not only at one factor at a time, but instead examine the combination of all the factors. We explain the empirical support for both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets by showing that the pioneer should accommodate (retaliate) a late mover with its competitively low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Competitively high (low) elasticity variables are not (are) likely to be significantly reduced by a new entry in the anticipated competitive game. With regard to reallocation of the pioneer's marketing mix, we show that the change in the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should follow the change in the relative marketing mix effectiveness after new entry. This, in turn, depends on the structure of competition, the impact of the late mover on its elasticities and margins, and the competitor's marketing mix elasticities, in addition to own elasticities. The results can guide managers on how factors such as competitive structure, changes in elasticities and margin, and market growth impact the pioneer's marketing mix decisions, and on when to accommodate, retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies.",Shankar V.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.16.3.271,Competitive Strategy; Defensive Strategy; Econometric Models; Game Theory; Marketing Mix; Resource Allocation Policy,5.0,,10,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the strategic implications of pioneers' marketing mix reactions to new entrants in the market, particularly how these reactions affect long-term competitive positioning and resource allocation in response to market dynamics.",scopus-prediction,60,25,Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to entry in different competitive game structures: Theoretical analysis and empirical illustration,1997

"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify different service innovation drivers, innovation process activities and to understand industrial services innovation management and coordination, as well as to develop a framework for industrial service innovation management and coordination. Design/methodology/approach - The study involved collection of information and data from the literature and the Norwegian oil and gas (O&G) industry. A survey was conducted to get an overview of existing practices and guided interviews were conducted to confirm the findings of the survey. Findings - The study indicates that the market needs are considered the most important innovation process driver, feedback from the customers is the most important activity to encourage service innovations, whilst return on investments is the most important decision-making factor in evaluating innovation feasibility. Employees are the most important source of innovation ideas. Furthermore, interactions between different companies, as well as involvement of customer, employees and suppliers in the innovation process are becoming increasingly important. Practical implications - The study shows that service providers and receivers often collaborate in the innovation processes, and that many of the activities are performed simultaneously. This results in the collaborative parties needing to put resources on managing and coordinating the innovation process in a structured, effective and efficient way. The proposed framework for service innovation management and coordination provides practitioners with a structured approach to manage industrial service innovations.

"The advent of optical scanning devices and decreases in the cost of computing power have made it possible to assemble databases with sales and marketing mix information in an accurate and timely manner. These databases enable the estimation of demand functions and pricing/promotion decisions in ""real"" time. Commercial suppliers of marketing research like A. C. Nielsen and IRI are embedding estimated demand functions in promotion planning and pricing tools for brand managers and retailers. This explosion in the estimation and use of demand functions makes it timely and appropriate to re-examine several fundamental issues. In particular, demand functions are latent theoretical constructs whose exact parametric form is unknown. Estimates of price elasticities, profit maximizing prices, interbrand competition and other policy implications are conditional on the parametric form assumed in estimation. In practice, many forms may be found that are not only theoretically plausible but also consistent with the data. The different forms could suggest different profit maximizing prices leaving it unclear as to what is the appropriate pricing action. Specification tests may lack the power to resolve this uncertainty, particularly for non-nested comparisons. Also, the structure of these tests does not permit seamless integration of estimation, specification analysis and optimal pricing into a unified framework. As an alternative to the existing approaches, I propose a Bayesian mixture model (BMM) that draws on Bayesian estimation, inference, and decision theory, thereby providing a unified framework. The BMM approach consists of input, estimation, diagnostic and optimal pricing modules. In the input module, alternate parametric models of demand are specified along with priors. Utility structures representing the decision maker's attitude towards risk can be explicitly specified. In the estimation module, the inputs are combined with data to compute parameter estimates and posterior probabilities for the models. The diagnostic module involves testing the statistical assumptions underlying the models. In the optimal pricing module the estimates and posterior probabilities are combined with the utility structure to arrive at optimal pricing decisions. Formalizing demand uncertainty in this manner has many important payoffs. While the classical approaches emphasize choosing a demand specification, the BMM approach emphasizes constructing an objective function that represents a mixture of the specifications. Hence, pricing decisions can be arrived at even when there is no consensus among the different parametric specifications. The pricing decisions will reflect parametric demand uncertainty, and hence be more robust than those based on a single demand model. The BMM approach was empirically evaluated using store level scanner data. The decision context was the determination of equilibrium wholesale prices in a noncooperative game between several leading national brands. Retail demand was parametrized as semilog and doublelog with diffuse priors for the models and the parameters. Wholesale demand functions were derived by incorporating the retailers' pricing behavior in the retail demand function. Utility functions reflecting risk averse and risk neutral decision makers were specified. The diagnostic module confirms that face validity measures, residual analysis, classical tests or holdout predictions were unable to resolve the uncertainty about the parametric form and by implication the uncertainty with regard to pricing decisions. In contrast, the posterior probabilities were more conclusive and favored the specification that predicted better in a holdout analysis. However, across the brands, they lacked a systematic pattern of updating towards any one specification. Also, none of the priors updated to zero or one, and there was considerable residual uncertainty about the parametric specification. Despite the residual uncertainty, the BMM approach was able to determine the equilibrium wholesale prices. As expected, specifications influence the BMM pricing solutions in accordance with their posterior probabilities which act as weights. In addition, differing attitudes towards risk lead to considerable divergence in the pricing actions of the risk averse and the risk neutral decision maker. Finally, results from a Monte Carlo experiment suggest that the BMM approach performs well in terms of recovering potential improvements in profits.",Kalyanam K.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.15.3.207,Bayesian econometrics; Decision theory; Demand structures; Nonnested models; Pricing; Regression; Scanner data,5.0,,10,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the development of a Bayesian mixture model for estimating demand functions and making pricing decisions, which aligns with long-term strategic goals of organizations in marketing and pricing strategy.",scopus-prediction,60,25,Pricing decisions under demand uncertainty: A Bayesian mixture model approach,1996

A novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, the product life-time of the specific generation to be analyzed will be predicted by the fuzzy piecewise regression line that is derived based upon the product life-time of earlier generations. In the second stage of the forecast methodology, the annual shipment of products of the specified generation will be predicted by deriving annual fuzzy regression lines for each generation, based upon the historical data on the earlier generations' products. An empirical study predicting the life-time and the annual shipment of the 16 Mb (Mega bit) DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) PLC is illustrated to validate the analytical process. The results demonstrate that two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis can predict multiple generation PLT and PLC precisely, thereby serving as a foundation for future strategic planning, policy definitions and foresights. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Accurate sales projections are of vital importance to the profitability and long-term survival of high-tech companies. This is especially true in the growth stage of product innovation, because major investments and marketing decisions are made in this phase. By examining recent empirical studies focusing on consumer behavior in high-technology markets, several factors are identified that can affect individual buying decisions and aggregate sales, namely, interpersonal communication, democratization of innovation, direct and indirect network effects, forward-looking behavior, and consumer heterogeneity. Against this background the diffusion-modeling and the utility-based approach are reviewed in terms of their basic conception and their applicability to the markets concerned. Based on this investigation a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, specifically in the growth stage, is developed. The model has a utility-theoretic background and a logistic structure. Since data are scarce in this early stage of the product life cycle two versions of the new approach are discussed, an extended version considering forward-looking behavior and a more parsimonious (""myopic"") one. The performance of the new model is demonstrated using real sales data on the CD player, the DVD player/recorder, and the digital camera market. The empirical comparisons include alternative specifications of the Bass diffusion model as well as a proportional hazard model and consist of two steps. First, the models are checked as to whether they are able to represent the sales data at all. It is shown that both versions of the proposed model are at least equivalent, if not superior, to the models used as benchmarks in terms of fit. In the next step, the models are applied to predict future sales in the three markets. The resulting forecasts show that the proposed model performs significantly better than its benchmarks. Its parsimony enables reliable predictions, even in cases, where only short time series are available for parameter estimation. The model is able to anticipate decreasing diffusion rates as they occur at the end of the growth stage and, thus, helps to avoid overoptimistic sales forecasts, which may cause severe economic damages. The new approach is easy to calibrate and can be applied without specialized econometric expertise. © 2009 Product Development & Management Association.",Decker R.; Gnibba-Yukawa K.,Strategic,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2009.00703.x,,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, which is essential for long-term planning and decision-making in high-tech companies.

"The strategic role of logistics is increasingly being recognised, and inventory strategy is an essential element of logistics strategy. Demand forecasting is one of the most crucial issues of inventory management as forecasts form the basis for the planning of production, transportation and inventory levels. The traditional methods used for forecasting include time series methods and causal methods. In the paper, we present an Analytic Hierarchy Process-based approach to demand forecasting.

"Previous researches have considered that the impact of fashion change and fashion consumption is linear. Therefore, one reason was found as the ultimate source to explain why a fashion style/ trend was spread to the mass market. However, the existing market is complex and difficult to find out the holistic reason to explain fashion consumption. In this study, the chaotic perspective is taken into account to investigate the relationship between fashion change and fashion consumption. By using the grounded theory method, 33 in-depth interviews were conducted. A chaotic fashion consumption model is developed from the findings to explain how different fashions are consumed and rejected while fashion changes. It is found that the interaction of being fashionable, perceived fashionability and system participation affects the ultimate decision on fashion consumption. It is also found that a pattern can be traced to forecast the degree of fashion consumption even when the fashion change phenomenon is chaotic. Thus, it is similar to the principle of chaos theory that short-term prediction is possible in relation to the degree of fashion acceptance among consumers. Marketing implications are suggested with reference to the chaotic fashion consumption model. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Ming Law K.; Zhang Z.-M.; Leung C.-S.,Strategic,10.1108/13612020410559966,Consumers; Fashion; Social change; Young adults,5.0,,15,0,,The abstract discusses a chaotic fashion consumption model that explores the relationship between fashion change and consumption.

"This article analyses the strategic options facing a domestic firm threatened by the entry of MNCs - whether to attack the incoming MNC, to cooperate with it, to defend their home position or to exit the market. The authors suggest a framework for determining an optimum strategy based on the firm's market (global or local) and the strength of its strategic and marketing assets. They test the framework by studying the response strategies to MNC entry of 78 Israeli firms, tracking their reactions from 1993 to 1999, as significantly more MNCs entered the market. Was the model able to predict which strategies were selected by the firms? For firms competing in global markets, barely half of those with strong assets chose to 'contend' with MNCs as predicted. The rest chose a 'cooperator' strategy, as did all firms with weak assets (in line with model predictions). For firms competing locally, the majority with strong assets followed the predicted 'contester' strategy, and the majority with weak assets chose a 'defender' strategy, again in accordance with the model. Statistical tests of the model resulted in acceptance of all hypotheses in the holdout sample and 3 out of 4 in the main sample.

"Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and ""clean"" products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise - consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.",Banyte J.; Brazioniene L.; Gadeikiene A.,Strategic,,Corporate social responsibility; Green consumer; Green marketing; Lithuanian market of ecofriendly food products,5.0,,10,0,Kauno Technologijos Universitetas,The abstract discusses the long-term implications of changing consumer preferences towards eco-friendly products and the integration of corporate social responsibility into marketing strategies.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address these questions. Word-of-mouth (WOM) is increasingly important in business-to-business (B2B) decision-making. Yet, research on this topic is rather limited, and often borrows from business-to-consumer (B2C) WOM literature. The question remains as to whether these assumptions realistically occur in B2B WOM. Specifically, this study explores the following questions: What value does B2B WOM have? Why do social media influencers in B2B engage in WOM? What type(s) of social media influencers spread WOM in B2B? Design/methodology/approach: To address these questions, this study adopts a qualitative research strategy. This study focuses on industry analysts in information technology markets who often influence the buying decisions of customers through their expertise and recommendations of technology solutions. Based on interviews with these influencers, this study explicates B2B WOM, an area the authors know much less of in comparison to B2C WOM. Findings: This study reveals differences in who spreads WOM within B2B, their roles, key features of their content and how they spread WOM. Second, this study demonstrates the types of actors spreading WOM in B2B in relation to the type of WOM and how it actually influences B2B markets. Originality/value: This study broadens the current definition of WOM and, specifically, showcases WOM not only as amplifying messages but as a means to co-create the market itself with vendors and clients.

"The purpose of this study is to identify and prioritize green marketing strategies in the food industry by taking sustainability goals into consideration since it is very difficult to prioritize and select green marketing strategies when considering sustainability criteria in their implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to use an appropriate solution to prioritize these strategies. For this purpose, sustainability criteria and green marketing strategies are recognized. Then, sustainability criteria are screened using the fuzzy Delphi method. Subsequently, using the fuzzy stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis method, the criteria are weighted according to expert recommendations. Next, green marketing strategies in the Iranian food industry are ranked using several fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making methods: fuzzy additive ratio assessment, fuzzy complex proportional assessment, fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution, and fuzzy Viekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje methods. Finally, the results are integrated with the help of the Copeland method to choose the best strategies. The results indicated that the criteria of ‘minimizing waste’, ‘minimizing environmental impacts’, and ‘consumer participation’ had the highest weight.

The theoretical framework proposed in this research integrates consumer behavior theories to enhance our understanding of the relationship between marketing mix strategies and international students’ enrollment choices. Building upon previous research that underscores the importance of marketing mix strategies in shaping consumer choices, this study focuses specifically on the context of international students deciding to study in Jordan. To achieve its objectives, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of 2000 international students who recently enrolled in both public and private universities in Jordan, with a response rate of 61%. Through rigorous empirical analysis, this study provides compelling evidence that the quality of the product/program, price, place, and promotion significantly influence the decision-making process of international students. Moreover, the study reveals that EWOM plays a critical mediating role in this relationship, underscoring the significance of online reviews, ratings, and recommendations in shaping consumer perceptions and choices.

"This paper investigates the selection criteria and success factors of retailers within mixed-use developments in Shanghai, from the 2009 financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic. By using Multiple Criteria Decision Making focused on three groups of key performance indicators: External, specifics of the Industry, and Users, the study aims to provide a comprehensive review of retail location selection within the emerging paradigm of mixed-use environments. The assessment reveals that connectivity, specifically with metro stations within 500 m, is paramount to a project’s success. Moreover, 73% of the projects surveyed feature more than two underground levels, with the top 10 ranking projects boasting 3–4 floors above ground, occupied by both offices and retail spaces. Structurally, almost 90% of the mixed-use developments being studied have commercial areas exceeding 35,000 sqm. The optimal project size is determined to be around 200,000 sqm, with retail making up half of the built area. The preferred land plot size ranges from 35,000 to 40,000 sqm. However, the study also identifies a lack of comprehensive sustainability strategies and net-zero carbon certifications in many of these developments. The findings also contribute to urban researchers and policymakers by offering a multi-criteria matrix to assess and scale mixed-use developments, not only in Shanghai but also in other geographical locations.

"To minimise risk, consumers seek out eWOM, recommendations, and reviews from others before making purchasing decisions. However, it is not uncommon to see companies masterminding deceptive eWOM, disguising promotional messages as user-generated product reviews to attract and retain consumers. The extant literature is extremely limited regarding deceptive eWOM and its long-term effects. Ours is the first longitudinal study to examine consumers’ belief and attitude changes in the context of deceptive eWOM. This study found that, in a herding situation, deceptive eWOM can strongly influence changes in consumers’ beliefs and attitudes, whether in the early phase or mainstream phase, at the pre-adoption stage. If deceptive eWOM emerges earlier, it has a more powerful influence later. At the post-adoption stage, once they have used it, consumers may change their evaluations of a new product. However, this new evaluation is still subject to the initial anchoring effect brought by deceptive eWOM. If consumers sense deceptive eWOM and attribute it to a certain responsible party, the anchoring effect will be weakened.

"Mass media have been a significant element in society. However, as people have more access to information and communication technology, they spend more time on digital media than on mass media. Thus, we explore this issue along with the factors and implications that this trend might bring about. This is the first study to conduct an in-depth comparative analysis along with literature review to understand this major change in media consumption. The paper first analyzes the characteristics and the communication process of mass and digital media. Then, we compare mass media and digital media’s usage, the numbers of Internet and digital media’ users in the United States along with global social media users. We discover the usage per day for digital media has increased while that for mass media declined. We explore the reasons behind this change and identify factors affecting the marketers’ decisions to change the ways they spend marketing communications’ budget on both types of media. We are also interested in the roles of mass media in the era when digital media gain more popularity. Implications and recommendations for marketers to cope with this major change are discussed including the impact on target market selection, marketing communications budget planning, functions of the media, behavioral transactions of both types of media, new supporting roles of the mass media and the roles of both types of media in supporting integrated marketing communications’ campaigns. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Introduction Electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems (ENDS/ ENNDS) are attracting new nicotine users, particularly nonsmokers, and youth. Although the long-term health effects are uncertain, ENDS contain nicotine—a highly addictive product, and most of the existing evidence on ENDS/ENNDS shows that they are not without risks. Moreover, youth and non-smokers using e-cigarettes are more likely to initiate conventional cigarettes and start at earlier ages. Furthermore, ENDS are not very effective as cessation aids and are often used in combination with conventional tobacco products. The taxation of ENDS/ENNDS remains a challenge for most governments, especially in light is the tradeoff between, on the one hand, the potential that smokers would use ENDS to quit conventional cigarettes successfully and, on the other hand, the new health risks that these products pose and the uptake of use by young people and non-smokers. Objective About ENDS/ENNDS, this session will examine, globally and comparatively, three key areas critical for advocacy: taxation, legal (non-tax and price) frameworks, and communications used by manufacturers and vendors. Material and Methods First, it will present and evaluate the tax systems used currently in countries that manufacture or sell ENDS/ENNDS and compare these systems based on their tax burdens and designs. Second, it examines the various legal (non-tax and price) frameworks used in these countries and compares them with conventional cigarettes. Third, it will present the media used by manufacturers and vendors of ENDS/ENNDS, the messages, and the audience they use to promote them. Finally, the session will present and compare case studies to provide concrete examples. Results There is a significant variation in the types of tax systems used for ENDS/ENNDS, and most countries impose very low tax rates on these products compared to cigarettes. As WHO has concluded, e-cigarettes are “harmful” and countries that have not banned e-cigarettes should ensure that “their tobacco control laws and regulations are comprehensive enough to regulate all forms of novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products.” E-cigarette manufacturers, including the major tobacco companies, are spending millions of dollars on lobbying decision-makers in countries around the world to seek favorable e-cigarette regulation. Further, the industry targets non-smokers and young people through product design, nicotine delivery, flavorings, and by marketing on social media. Conclusions Encourage countries to follow WHO recommendations and impose high taxation for ENDS/ENNDS and regulations that match those of conventional cigarettes. © (2023), (European Publishing).

"PURPOSE: The main purpose of this qualitative study was to explore tech start-up failures in Sri Lanka to emerge themes that explain the critical factors that are impacting failures of Sri Lankan tech start-ups and also to identify recommendations that could help evade those factors. The paper also presents the finding to enrich tech entrepreneurs to build their strategies with an understanding of factors that leads to failure and to make well-educated decisions. METHODOLOGY: The study is based on a qualitative research approach that helps to present findings in a theoretical way. A phenomenological analysis has been used to identify, understand, and analyze the phenomena of tech start-up failures. Twelve start-up leaders participated in this study and shared their lived experiences of tech start-up failures in Sri Lanka. Interviews were conducted with them based on twelve interview questions and twelve core themes emerged based on the participants’ lived experiences. In analyzing data, the modified Van Kaam approach was used, utilizing a seven-step framework that considers the structural and textual aspects of experiences, as well as the perceptual characteristics of the phenomenon. FINDINGS: The themes answered the key research question of the study: What are the critical factors that are impacting on failures of tech start-ups in Sri Lanka? The cause of tech start-up failures according to the current study varied including, financial uncertainty, no market research, no product–market fit, paranoid behaviors of innovators, lack of timely response to changing conditions, and location of the venture. IMPLICATIONS: The paper concisely presents twelve critical reasons for tech start-up failures. The results of the research will enable Sri Lankan tech start-ups to identify key factors of failure for the growth of their surviving strategies. Identifying secret obstacles in the industry helps entrepreneurs prepare for pitfalls and provides guidelines for policymakers to make informed choices when implementing national policies. More importantly, it has been discovered that the major areas that require more attention are leadership, funding, marketing, and innovation. Finally, four groups of recommendations have been discussed under financing, market research, leadership, and inventors. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The comparison of the current study themes with the findings of related studies is inconclusive because the literature on tech start-up failures in other countries and in Sri Lanka is minimal. Some of the themes align with the findings of research conducted in other countries, although there were some themes that were explored uniquely. © 2023, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeline for economic growth in both developed and emerging markets; however, they continue to face growth challenges. Theoretically, SMEs are major contributors to employment creation, wealth generation and poverty alleviation. Literature shows that SME sustainability is affected by a variety of variables, including reputation. The article seeks to analyse the relationship between SME entrepreneurial marketing, described as customer intensity and proactiveness, and overall performance, associated with consumer reputation, in emerging markets. Three hypotheses were generated from literature review, and they were tested through empirical data collected from Manicaland Province SMEs. The hypotheses relate to the linkages between entrepreneurial marketing and overall SME performance. A total of 190 entrepreneurs operating SMEs in Manicaland Province were surveyed. Through convenience sampling, entrepreneurs who employ a minimum of five people were selected from all the districts of Manicaland Province. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the three hypotheses. The article finds that two dimensions of entrepreneurial marketing impact on overall SME performance. Three strategic recommendations arise from this article that may improve the impact of entrepreneurship marketing on the performance of SMEs, and they are detailed under the last section. Together, the three strategic recommendations imply that SMEs marketing has to rely on research in order to: gain understanding of determinants and outcomes of international entrepreneurship and innovation; analyse possible matrices of strategic approaches to international entrepreneurship management in decision-making; and exploit the potential for using corporate social behaviour as a niche for gaining competitive advantage for sustainable development. © Journal of Global Business and Technology.",Mutanho D.; Shumba T.,Strategic,,Emerging Markets; Entrepreneurship; Marketing; Small and Medium Enterprises; Zimbabwe,5.0,,10,0,"Global Business and Technology Association, Inc.","The abstract discusses the long-term implications of entrepreneurial marketing on SME performance, indicating a focus on strategic goals and planning for sustainable development in emerging markets.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,"IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL MARKETING ON OVERALL SME PERFORMANCE IN MANICALAND PROVINCE, ZIMBABWE",2024

"The value chain for jumbo squid fishery encompasses a process of linking multiple components and actors that generate and promote capitalization of the added value of this fishery product. This study aims to diagnose the value chain for jumbo squid in Mexico using the structural analysis approach, allowing a description of the main actors, and their interactions with the markets, socioeconomic drivers, as well as the influence of different variables in the performance of jumbo squid chain value. The results derived from the structural analysis, six variables (related to the transformation, marketing, and consumption activities) and two actors (producers and academic research) were identified as the most relevant. The competitive advantages and added value could be reached by integrating the aspects related to the most relevant variables and taking appropriate decisions to deal with situations of uncertainty, which can promote weak nodes in the value chain, primarily because of the failures in the commercialization and consumption of jumbo squid. This suggests that efforts should not be concentrated on a single node but should be addressed jointly. Considering that the jumbo squid value chain currently depends on the changing conditions of the fishery, which is marked by production instability, causing uncertainty in the subsequent nodes; the status indicates that a restructuring of the value chain is evident since the market is prone to dismantling or self-regulation over the medium term. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Cruz-Escalona V.H.; Moncaleano-Rubio Y.A.; Morales-Bojórquez E.; Arizmendi-Rodríguez D.I.; Pérez-Palafox X.A.; Ornelas-Vargas A.; Payán-Alcacio J.Á.; Urcádiz-Cazares F.J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.marpol.2024.106099,"MACTOR method; Matrix of Alliances and Conflicts, Tactics, Objectives and Recommendations; Matrix of Cross Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification; MICMAC method; MORPHOL method; Structural analysis",5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the value chain for jumbo squid fishery, focusing on long-term goals, competitive advantages, and the integration of various actors and factors within the fishery system.

"Esports, competitive video gaming competitions, are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with their growth in emerging markets contingent on local area network (LAN) gaming centers. LAN gaming centers are integral in emerging economies as they provide access to gaming technology and infrastructure that may be otherwise unavailable. Given their importance, the purpose of our study is to identify characteristics relevant to LAN gaming center operations within the context of an emerging market. We conducted a two-phase, multimethod analysis of LAN gaming centers in Iran, an emerging yet dynamic market. In the first phase, we used a balanced scorecard (BSC) approach to identify business factors salient to LAN gaming center operations. In the second phase, we collected data from LAN gaming center consumers (N = 330) to rank the factors by importance using a multi attribute decision-making (MADM) model. We found that business factors relevant to LAN gaming centers operations include: offering a variety of services, providing attractive and modern facilities, employing sports marketing methods, monitoring competition, and developing multiple streams of revenue. via the BSC, our research offers strategic recommendations for LAN gaming centers. LAN gaming centers provide access to modern gaming technology and help consumers overcome technological limitations by providing a physical space for esports.

"Purpose: This study explores the mediating effects of relationship marketing orientation (RMO) and service quality orientation (SQO) on market orientation, selling orientation, and policyholder retention in non-life insurance services. Additionally, it offers important recommendations for non-life insurers in Taiwan for policy development and improving policyholder retention. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of policyholders belonging to the top five non-life insurance companies in Taiwan. The data were then analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings: RMO and SQO mediate the effects of the salesperson’s market orientation on policyholder retention. Thus, RMO and SQO are key factors influencing policyholder retention. Consequently, high levels of market orientation should be maintained to increase RMO and SQO, strengthening the retention rate of non-life insurance policyholders. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature. In the future, researchers should collect data from other countries and service industries (e.g. banks, securities, and other financial institutions), expand to different insurance contexts (e.g. life insurance), and conduct longitudinal studies or experimental research. Practical implications: The results of this study can act as a guide for providers of non-life insurance services. Based on the research results, we recommend decision-makers pay increased attention to increasing policyholder retention rates by strengthening their firm’s RMO and SQO. Originality/value: Few studies have investigated the relationships among market orientation, selling orientation, RMO, SQO, and policyholder retention in non-life insurance services within Asian contexts in general and specifically in Taiwan. Thus, this study’s theoretical contributions, managerial implications (especially for decision-makers), and the proposed future research directions represent timely and valuable additions to the literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Yu T.-W.,Strategic,10.1108/APJML-10-2023-1014,Market orientation; Policyholder retention; Relationship marketing orientation; Selling orientation; Service quality orientation,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study explores long-term implications for policyholder retention in non-life insurance services, focusing on the impact of relationship marketing orientation and service quality orientation on overall marketing strategies.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Mediating effects of relationship marketing orientation and service quality orientation on policyholder retention in non-life insurance services,2024
"Purpose: Second-order system-dynamics engineering (SOSDE) involves constructing and running enterprise manufacturing simulation models with new proposals for operational processes, byproducts, supply chain and/or downstream marketing designs. This paper aims to describe sustainability the principal lessons from enacting SOSDE research for achieving goals in large manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a case research commentary in the agricultural industry that contributes abductively derives six principal lessons from SOSDE research on introducing sustainability-focused manufacturing and product innovations. Operational processes in large-scale poultry processing plants in an emerging market represent the specific industry and firm domain of this case study. Alternative SOSDE simulation models of decisions, materials flow and outcomes with versus without operational innovations were constructed following one-to-one interviews with experienced farm managers and entrepreneurs. Findings: The principles demonstrate how large farms in a developing nation (i.e. Bangladesh) go about adopting radically innovative manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations to improve traditional operations. This study confirms and expands on the general observation that SOSDE can help achieve sustainability and environmental, social and governance goals, contribute new value outcomes by converting unused production wastes into valuable byproducts and introduce design efficiencies in production, supply chain and marketing processes. SOSDE complements, while being a revolutionary departure from, “six sigma management programs” that focus on achieving exceptional and near mistake-free manufacturing operations. Both represent distinct philosophies and sets of actions that sometimes can conflict with one another. Embracing both successfully in the same enterprise is a goal that may appear unreachable, seemingly impossible to achieve and yet represents a manufacturing/marketing epitome that is observable in exceptional enterprises. Research limitations/implications: This paper may generate controversy as well as advance interest in applying SOSDE in introductions of improved manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations aiming to accomplish radical improvements in sustainability goals. Practical implications: This commentary describes how using SOSDE and running alternative production simulations with versus without including superior, radically new, process innovations enable the firm to find and eliminate glitches in system changes and reduce the fear associating with breakdowns and financial losses due to inadequate knowledge of operating new industrial procedures and outcomes. Social implications: Introductions of superior radically new innovations in industrial manufacturing and marketing via SOSDE frequently include manufacturing firms embracing new environment sustainability objectives and additional marketable byproducts from the firm's main productions lines. This commentary offers details on how this process is enacted in poultry manufacturing in an economically emerging nation. Originality/value: Running simulations in SOSDE research offers a low-cost, fast and in-depth method to test “what-if” impacts of enhanced and radical innovations into product/service manufacturing operations – benefits supporting the recommendation to apply systems dynamics in business and industrial marketing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Shamsuddoha M.; Woodside A.G.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-05-2022-0193,Radical innovation; SOSDE; Supply chain; Sustainability; System dynamics,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to sustainability and operational innovations in manufacturing, particularly in the context of large firms in the agricultural industry.

"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the comparative importance of factors influencing the customer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking for consumer finance in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: First, a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature was conducted to identify a broad range of factors related to customer shift behavior. Through an expert sampling, 14 essential factors were chosen for further investigation. Second, a questionnaire was developed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). This questionnaire was then distributed among customers who had previously been using conventional banking services but had made a shift toward Islamic banking. The purpose of this questionnaire was to gather data and insights regarding their motivations and decision-making process behind the shift, and a sample 215 customers are taken in the study. Findings: The results of AHP depicts that the religiosity is a most important factor influencing customers to shift from conventional to Islamic banking, and the second most important factor is pricing. The other subsequent important factors are reputation of the bank, marketing and promotion, service quality, behavior of banks staff, Shariah compliance, management, convenience, fastness and charges/fees. Whereas documentation, ambiance and recommendation are found least important factors to patronize Islamic banking. Practical implications: The study recommends Islamic banks to create awareness, concentrating on religious factor to have a greater impact on growth of Islamic banking and shrinking of conventional banking. Further, it suggests Islamic banks to apply Shariah-recommended approach of doing business, to help community in best possible way and to launch differentiated marketing techniques to attract customers. It also proposes regulatory authorities to provide facilitation to Islamic banking business by providing level playing field similar to conventional banking, tax equality and conversion of public financing from conventional banking to Islamic banking. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its comprehensive analysis of factors influencing consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking in the context of consumer finance in Pakistan. By using the AHP, the study provides a structured approach to understanding the relative importance of these factors. This is the uniqueness of the paper that it applies the AHP for the analysis. Furthermore, the study offers practical implications for Islamic banks and regulatory authorities to effectively address and capitalize on this consumer shift trend. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Ahmad M.; Zafar M.B.; Perveen A.,Strategic,10.1108/JIMA-02-2023-0036,AHP; Bank selection criteria; Consumer shift; Decision-making; Islamic banking; Islamic consumer finance; Pakistan,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on the long-term factors influencing customer behavior in the context of banking, aiming to define the strategic goals for Islamic banking growth in Pakistan.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking: decision-making analysis through AHP,2024

"Purpose: High failure rates characterise the experience of new entrepreneurial ventures in Nigeria and other emerging economies. Reliance on strategic tools such as entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is critical to the growth and survival of new ventures. This empirical study aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between EO and performance of new venture logistics firms in Nigeria. It further explores the contingent effects of social capital and marketing capabilities on the hypothesised direct relationships from a transport industry perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Managers of 650 new venture logistics service providers in selected Nigerian cities were Web-surveyed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. Regression analysis was further performed. Common method variance and other validity checks were assessed. Findings: The 469 valid responses showed a positive relationship between EO and new venture performance (NVP). Social capital and marketing capabilities positively moderate the direct relationship between EO and NVP. Managerial implications suggest that context-specific dynamics must be considered when making strategic EO decisions to aid firm growth and survival. Originality/value: This study directly responds to the contingency approach recommendation of past studies (Anwar et al., 2022; Van Stel et al., 2021; Covin and Wales, 2019) using the logistics service and emerging economy context.

"Hospitality and Tourism are among the fastest-growing sectors and the source of foreign exchange with indirect-direct employments for quite an appreciable number of economies worldwide. The nature of the sector provides an avenue towards regional development through entrepreneurship venture creations, value addition to the abandoned resources, and regeneration of abandon natural resources with new themes as a novel approach. Tourism currently in a paradigm shift as a comparative advantage of destination is becoming less important than a competitive advantage. The traditional destinations are diminishing while creating novel destinations more relaxation-oriented while leading to residents' economically enriched livelihood. The paper critically analyzes the current tourism competitive position of Sri Lanka with a panel of five rival destinations by adopting shift-share analysis by developing two propositions. Regional Tourism arrivals in rival tourism destinations have been used to perform Shift-share analysis. Findings revealed (a) Sri Lanka as a destination is gaining the competitive advantage of four tourism regions out of six markets.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption contexts. It analyzes the impact of religiosity in influencing consumer life decisions and behaviors. The proposed framework is based on the norm activation theory (NAT) with religiosity added to it based on the extant literature. The paper aims to provide implications for marketing researchers and practitioners derived from its analysis and propositions. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper proposes a model for marketing researchers to consider the role of religiosity as a cultural and psychological factor in influencing online collaborative consumption. The NAT is adopted as the base of the conceptual model. The model posits research propositions on the potential interaction of religiosity with existing relationships in the theory to predict online collaborative consumption behavior. Findings: The NAT is considered a prominent model in studying pro-environmental behaviors and it was adopted in various studies. Some researchers adopted the theory to study collaborative consumption as a pro-environmental behavior. Religiosity was found to significantly impact pro-environmental behaviors, but no research was found regarding its impact on collaborative consumption. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and implications to marketing practitioners about the role of religiosity in influencing collaborative consumption behavior. Originality/value: Although there were few research studies that exist in discussing the role of religiosity in explaining consumer behavior, it could be argued that this paper is the first of its kind, according to the best of the authors’ knowledge, that discusses the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption contexts through the use of NAT. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Abutaleb S.; El-Bassiouny N.M.; Hamed S.,Strategic,10.1108/JIMA-09-2019-0186,Collaborative consumption; Norm activation theory; Religiosity; Sharing economy,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption, proposing a framework that influences consumer behavior and marketing strategies.

"Introduction. The discussion of the shaping of a digital image of university faculty member is driven by the need for effective educational interaction between students and faculty in the context of digitalization. However, there are practically no studies of the faculty’s image as a system, as well as technologies for modeling the faculty’s digital image. The objective of this study is to model faculty’s digital image for purposes of decision-making in the process of managing digital image in educational interactions. Materials and Methods. Secondary data were received through methods of content analysis and systemic and structural-functional evaluation of information. Primary data were obtained through comparative marketing study of faculty’s digital image on a sample of 400 students and 92 faculty members of a Moscow-based and a regional university and through an expert survey. Methods of multivariate scaling and analysis of statistically significant differences were also applied. Results. Novelty of the study lies in incorporating basic and instrumental core components in the model of university faculty’s digital image due to a dual role of “digital competence” element. The image modeling technique is also developed. It is noticed that faculty’s digital competence is not only an element in the structure of faculty’s image, but also a tool that transmits the image to external environment. Based on results of the study, recommendations on implementation of technique of faculty member’s digital image modeling are proposed. Revealed differences in opinions of students and faculty of two universities can be attributed to unequal access to digital technologies in different regions. Discussion and Conclusion. Conclusions made by authors contribute to development of scientific thought on shaping and promotion of university faculty’s digital image. Results of the comparative study will enable the Moscow-based and regional universities faculty to differentiate and precisely approach issues of shaping and promoting personal digital image. © 2022 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

"Purpose: This study aims to capture the views of executives about the merit of using the two segmentation approaches (quantitative vs qualitative). Furthermore, this study aimed to examine costs and benefits for two different segmentation approaches, using a minimax simple cost-benefit analysis (CBA) matrix. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 16 semistructured interviews were conducted with executives within the University of Sharjah (UoS). Furthermore, a minimax approach was applied to the CBA study. Findings: Evidence in this study found that the financial cost of quantitative segmentation approaches was higher than qualitative approaches. However, the decision-makers trusted the quantitative approach more regardless of the incurred costs. The study also found that there was a limited knowledge about social marketing and segmentation among executives. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study relate to the methodology applied, the sample selected and the lead research. Another factor is selection bias, which limited this study to one organization’s executives. It is conceivable that middle-level management would have had the desire to participate because they make the recommendations to top management in decision-making. The researcher did not collect precise data on time taken to design, implement and analyses the two segmentation studies, which qualified the precision of the CBA. Also, the fact that the sample includes participants from a relatively narrow range of disciplines should be noted as a limitation of the study. Practical implications: The current study provides a case study demonstrating how CBA provides a dollar amount estimate permitting alternate segmentation approaches to be compared and contrasted, assisting in the value estimation of any social marketing project. Social implications: The paper draws upon two streams of the literature: social marketing and CBA. The paper focused on the understanding of the literature, CBA offers a technique applicable to demonstrating cost savings that can be derived from choosing one method over another. Moreover, CBA assists in understanding the benefits or potential opportunity cost both financially and nonfinancially. Originality/value: This paper presents one of the first studies conducting a CBA to compare and contrast two segmentation approaches in social marketing. The study provides interesting insights into the perceptions of management executives over alternative research methods, although the results are limited to a case study. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Ibrahim A.; Rundle-Thiele S.; Knox K.; Almestarihi R.,Strategic,10.1108/JSOCM-01-2022-0026,Costs-benefit analysis; Qualitative segmentation; Quantitative segmentation; Social marketing,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study addresses the long-term implications of segmentation approaches in social marketing, examining the benefits and costs of these methods which aligns with strategic decision-making processes.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,The relative merit of two segmentation approaches: executives views and a cost-benefit analysis,2022
"Background: Competitive forces influence social marketing efforts. Indeed, social marketers often find themselves “shadow boxing” various forms of competition throughout their interventions. Despite the seminal role of competition as a threat to social marketing intervention efficacy, few empirical studies have undertaken competitive analysis or compared the usefulness of competitive typologies. Thus, this paper proposes an index approach to categorize competitive typologies relevant to a specific social marketing intervention in terms of their ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability to the broader social cause domain. The proposed index approach is illustrated with empirical data, undertaking a competitive analysis of forces obstructing efforts to address educational inequality in Australia, then comparing the ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability of 15 competitive typologies noted in the social marketing literature to produce a competitor analysis index. Research Question: Which competitive typologies most effectively frame forces that inhibit educational equality social marketing efforts in Australia? Methods: Via interviews and focus groups, qualitative data were collected from 46 students from low socioeconomic status (LSES) backgrounds at six universities and sought to understand the influence of their home residence’s geographical remoteness on their university participation. The analysis revealed eight participant-identified differential competitors experienced by students from regional, rural and remote settings (LSES-R, n = 25, 54.4%) that were not experienced by those from metropolitan areas (LSES-M, n = 21, 45.6%). Fifteen competitive typologies were identified in the social marketing literature, and their capacity to frame these eight differential forces in terms of their ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability was critiqued. Findings: Unlike their metropolitan counterparts, LSES-R participants experienced situational (n = 3), dispositional (n = 3) and goal pursuit (n = 2) competitive forces. The most effective competition typologies comprised two classification options that were distinctly different and could classify both the unfriendly and friendly competition that exists in social marketing. Five competitor typologies were identified as easy to use, intuitive and generalizable to the broader educational inequality domain. Together, these five competitor typologies form a competitor analysis index for educational inequality researchers and practitioners to enhance their intervention efficacy. Recommendations: Despite widespread agreement as to the importance of competitor analysis in social marketing, the efficacy of various typologies has received little attention. Social marketers are encouraged to critique competitor typologies before selecting those which enable effective decision-making. Furthermore, it is recommended that social marketers use a competitor analysis index comprised of multiple typologies to better capture the nebulous nature of the many different types of competitors that exist in a specific social marketing context. Limitations: The educational inequalities cause and qualitative method may constrain generalisability, but they exemplify the importance of competition typology choice and model how competitor analysis indexes can be developed. © The Author(s) 2021.",Raciti M.M.,Strategic,10.1177/15245004211031872,competition; educational inequality; regional; typologies; university; widening participation,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses the development of a competitor analysis index for social marketing interventions, which involves long-term planning and understanding competitive forces in the context of addressing educational inequality.

"Diversity serves to enrich decision-making, innovation, reputation, and performance. The marketing academy, a microcosm of business and society, is making slow advances in diversity efforts. The study by Galak and Kahn (2021) seeks to codify experiences of gender and race within the marketing academy to elevate awareness and to provide recommendations that may address some of the issues raised. In this commentary, we focus on opportunities to more deeply investigate the complex impact of race on careers and advancement in the marketing academy. Essential further research would advance our understanding of the role of systemic racism—and how it affects the people who are given opportunities to become scholars as well as the research they are encouraged to conduct or can successfully publish in top journals. To more fully understand the climate for traditionally underrepresented faculty members in the USA, it likely necessitates a multi-method approach to generate understanding and insights before developing potential recommendations. To address these types of research questions, we propose a set of studies that would allow an understanding of not only how individuals experience racism, but also how that racism is perpetuated through university admissions, hiring, and promotion decisions. We not only recommend approaches to understand how to increase the presence of historically underrepresented groups in Marketing academia, but also how to enable the full integration and participation of these scholars at all levels in the academic hierarchy, and across all types of institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bradford T.W.; Perry V.G.,Strategic,10.1007/s11002-021-09580-w,Diversity and inclusion; Intersectionality; Marketing academia; Racial discrimination; Racism,5.0,,10,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to increasing diversity and understanding systemic racism within the marketing academy, aligning with strategic planning and organizational goals.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Marketing while Black: commentary on the Galak and Kahn 2019 Academic Marketing Climate Survey,2021
"Marketers and advertisers ignore new technology and diverse marketing tactics when attempting to increase product exposure, customer engagement, customer behavior and buying intention in fashion accessory marketplaces in developing countries. This research sought to discover how the Augmented Reality (AR) experience influenced consumer behavior, buying intention and pleasure when purchasing a fashion item in developing countries. This study employs positivist ideas to investigate the connections between various factors, believing that reality is unwavering, stable, and static. Experiential marketing following stimulus exposure will gather cross-sectional data. The undertaken study has developed proper experimental design (within group) from business innovation models, for instance, uses and gratification and user experience models. User experience is disclosed by its four defining characteristics: hedonic quality (identification and simulation), aesthetic quality, and pragmatic quality. After encountering an enhanced user experience, users have a more favorable attitude about purchasing; in contrast, pleasure from using the application directly impacts buying intention. It was also shown that knowledge of AR apps impacts user experience and attitude. The novelty of this research is multifarious, for instance, the smart lab was used as a marketing technology to explore a virtual mirror of the Ray-Ban products. Secondly, the augmented reality experiential marketing activities have been developed by the developers as bearing in mind the four different aspects of the user experience—haptic, hedonic, aesthetic, and pragmatic. It should be functional, simple to learn and use, symmetrical, pleasant, and appealing, while fulfilling the unconscious emotional elements of a customer’s purchase. The research is the first known study in Pakistan to evaluate the influence of augmented reality on consumer proficiency and its consequent effects on attitude and satisfaction for fashion accessory brands. The research also advances the notion that application familiarity is the most important moderator between attitude and an augmented reality-enriched user experience, contradicting the prior studies, which focus on gender and age. This research has important theoretical implications for future researchers, who may wish to replicate the proposed final model in developed and developing countries’ fashion brands. This research also has imperative managerial implications for brand managers and marketing managers, who could include the recommendations of this study in their marketing strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

"COVID-19 has impacted not only human lives, but also business organisations. The repercussions of the pandemic on global businesses include sustaining the value of a firm that could benefit stakeholders, such as the challenge for sponsored properties to attain sponsorship through a period of financial struggles and the capacity of a sponsor to provide it. It is imperative for business-to-business (B2B) communities to evaluate criteria and risks of sponsorship to instil public trust and consequently result in value creation for firms. At the same time, the role of the media is pivotal to create visibility of this partnership and achieve set sponsorship aims. With that said, the objective of this study is to explore the role of sponsorship decision making by Malaysian organisations during the pandemic and how the media have strengthened relationship marketing between businesses and their stakeholders; by examining the determinant factors of using media as an activation in sponsorship and the criteria of using media in sponsorship. The qualitative study conducted interviews with 13 corporate communication and marketing managers in Malaysia that are involved directly with sponsorship activation. The findings highlight the sponsorship ecosystem through the Malaysian media and B2B perspectives that would guide practitioners in making strategic decisions on B2B sponsorship matters, particularly on the relational approaches and media engagement should be seen as part of good business conduct. Future recommendation of this research is to seek the perceptions of consumers on the congruence of relationship marketing through sponsor-sponsored properties collaboration in Malaysian media. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

"Prior research on marketing curriculum design suggests that new course offerings are driven by inputs from faculty resources and interests, student demand and willingness to enroll in the course, and feedback from alumni and employers regarding the skills students need to be successful in the workplace. In the face of the rising costs of higher education and declining enrollments, it is critical that curriculum be developed that strikes a balance between the values and needs of faculty, students, and employers. The current study explores the disconnect between courses students most desire to take and courses business professionals most recommend they take for career success. Utilizing Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) and the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV) as lenses to explore student choice in regard to marketing elective course selection, this study offers empirical data on courses preferred by marketing students and recommended by employers.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and its potential influence on tourist behaviour in the short- to medium-term. While the influence of the pandemic on tourist’s perceived risk and its impact on their future travel behaviour is understandably yet to be established, the present paper discusses the potential nexus. Additionally, this paper provides tourism practitioners with some recommendations for mitigating the effect of potential heightened perceived risk on travel and tourism decision-making post the COVID-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper synthesises contemporary academic literature on perceived risk and post-crisis tourism with emerging information associated with the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. Findings: This paper draws empirical evidence from studies related to previous health crises and their impact on tourism, as well as tourist behaviour. By discussing previous studies within the context of the on-going COVID-19, it is possible to anticipate the influence that perceived risk associated with the pandemic may have on the post-crisis behaviour of tourists. Also, short-term measures to mitigate the effects of risk on tourism are posited to guide practitioners in the future recovery of the sector. Research limitations/implications: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and on-going crisis for the global tourism industry. Hence, the present paper serves as a primer to a broader discussion within the tourism discourse and provides theoretical direction for future tourism research. Practical implications: Key to the recovery of the global tourism industry will be encouraging both domestic and international tourism activity. However, while the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on tourist behaviour is yet to be substantiated, previous research predicts a situation of heightened perceived risk and the potential cognitive dissonance that may negatively influence tourist decision-making. To mitigate this potential effect, governance, augmented immigration policy, destination media profiling, recovery marketing and domestic tourism will be critical interventions. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to discuss the potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the post-crisis decision-making process of tourists and their conative behaviour. As a primer to further empirical research, this paper sets a pertinent research agenda for academic inquiry within an evolving and increasingly uncertain global tourism market. © 2020, Tafadzwa Matiza.",Matiza T.,Strategic,10.1108/JTF-04-2020-0063,COVID-19 pandemic; Perceived risk; The future of tourism; Tourism; Tourism recovery; Travel behaviour,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The paper focuses on the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourist behavior and provides recommendations for tourism practitioners, indicating a strategic approach to understanding and responding to changes in the tourism industry.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Post-COVID-19 crisis travel behaviour: towards mitigating the effects of perceived risk,2022
"As a society, we are aiming to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, and one of the most important challenges is fostering responsible production and consumption. Green marketing campaigns and instruction in university curricula are an opportunity to influence producers' and consumers' decision-making process in a positive way. This research aims to understand the instructional effects of non-compulsory university courses linked to sustainability and the circular economy (SCE) on students' motivations and behavior. We analyze students' proclivities to consume products and develop more sustainable habits before and after enrolling in SCE courses. Results confirm that the courses impacted students' propensities toward sustainable consumption. Therefore, the biggest changes in the six dimensions underlying green consumption reveal four key recommendations for developing a green marketing strategy. We recommend firms to 1) engage in green education, 2) create community, 3) be aware of consumer diversity, and 4) not differentiate by gender. For this reason, we argue that university education may greatly influence students' mindset concerning sustainable behavior. Results also revealed no significant gender differences, which contrasts with the differentiated behavior found in extant studies on older populations. © 2022 The Authors",Prieto-Sandoval V.; Torres-Guevara L.E.; García-Díaz C.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132509,Circular economy; Green marketing innovation; SDGs; Sustainable development; Young consumer behavior,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to sustainable development and education's impact on consumer behavior, which aligns with strategic planning in organizations.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Green marketing innovation: Opportunities from an environmental education analysis in young consumers,2022
"Purpose. The objective of the study is to substantiate the feasibility of marketing management implementation in agricultural enterprises to ensure their competitiveness. Methodology / approach. To achieve the research objective, the dialectical method of scientific inquiry, as well as general scientific methods, such as analysis, synthesis, comparison, economic-and-mathematical modeling (balance-optimization model), visualization and generalization were used to collect, analyze, evaluate, inform and present the study results and conclusions. Results. It was substantiated that marketing management, as a prominent component of crisis management, should be introduced in agricultural enterprises to identify most promising areas of their activity within current business environment in order to ensure their competitiveness. The efficiency and prospects of organic produce farming in Ukraine have been proved, as a contribution to the improvement of the economic, social and ecological conditions in the country. It was suggested that agricultural enterprises should apply a strategy of full or partial diversification of activities based on organic farming. The study presented the use of a balance-optimization model to make informed management decisions as to optimization of the crop sector production structure of an agricultural enterprise, focused on market demand and compliant with principles of sustainable development. The essence of the model is the calculation of the gross output value under the condition of using different options for fertilizer application in crop cultivation. Originality / scientific novelty.

"Purpose Beaches are icons of summer tourism and a strong motivating factor for the arrival of tourists in the sun and sea tourism destinations. Spending time on the beach is one of the most popular forms of tourism leisure worldwide. Beaches serve both as recreational areas of coastal cities, and valuable ecosystems that provide natural and protective functions. The Croatian coast is relatively rich in this valuable tourism resource, but the management of beaches as a tourist product has not reached significant progress. This dissertation aims to contribute to the sustainable management of beaches as a tourism product and recognises the possibility of involving all stakeholders in this process by studying socio-demographic factors, preferences, satisfaction, and future behavioural intentions of beach visitors. This knowledge can make an important contribution to the beach management process because it can be used to make more informed management decisions. Which characteristics of a particular beach need to be improved, what facilities should be introduced or discontinued, beach managers can find out through social science research methods that can encourage participation of all stakeholders, increase visitor satisfaction and destination competitiveness, and thus lay the groundwork for more sustainable development of beaches as tourism products. The purpose of this doctoral dissertation is to develop a cognitive-affective-conative model of beach visitor satisfaction. This dissertation developed, validated, and tested an empirical model of beach visitor satisfaction by combining the sustainable development framework, international coastal zone management protocols, and national legislation with theories of satisfaction, quality, and consumer behaviour. The empirical model includes measures of beach visitor satisfaction levels with natural beach features, beach facilities, overall beach experience, emotional experience and their future behavioural intention. Methodology The study follows a mixed method design, employing both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method was used for the purpose of testing the links between model constructs. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used in analyses of socio-demographic variable influences of beach visitors. Data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire on three separate beach locations in the Primorsko – goranska county littoral during the summer of 2021, with the paper assisted personal interview (PAPI) technique. A 5-point Likert scale was used in attribute level satisfaction and importance performance measurements. Qualitative methods include investigation by an unstructured inquiry of importance, concerning beach attributes not mentioned in the structured part of the questionnaire, as an opening of an unstructured interview with the beach visitor. Findings of the qualitative analysis have shown that beach visitors also value cultural factors and place high importance on beach sediment quality. Findings The findings of the descriptive statistical analyses concerning socio-demographic characteristics of beach visitors indicate that on average, women (59.4%) visit the beach more than men (40.6%). The most frequent age group of beach visitors is in between 45-54 years old (25.7%), followed by visitors in between 15-24 (21%) years old. Regarding education levels, on average most visitors have finished high school (54.6%) followed by visitors with university level education (43.5%). Foreign tourists make up most of beach visitors (60.2%) while domestic tourists are second most represented (20.7%), followed by local residents (17.2%) and season residents (1.9%). Concerning the habits of beach visitors, they are most likely to visit the beach as a family with children (31.3%), as a couple (26.8%) or with friends (26.3%). Beach visitors will most likely use a car to get to the beach (77.7%), go on foot (12.5%) or use public transport (8.8%). Concerning the time they spend on the beach, most visitors stay in between 3-5 hours long (39.5%), followed by stays in between 1-3 hours long (38.2%) and stays over 5 hours long (21.2%). The descriptive statistical analyses of structural model independent variable constructs for the whole sample of all three beaches, indicates that regarding beach natural characteristics, beach visitors are most satisfied with beach scenery = 4.57, cleanliness of the sea = 4.47 and texture of beach sediment = 4.06. Beach visitors are somewhat satisfied with the opportunities to observe maritime species = 3.42. The least levels of beach visitor satisfaction are with available shade on the beaches = 2.82. Concerning beach visitor satisfaction with beach facilities, all average values of individual attributes are below 4, which indicates that beach visitors are on average more satisfied with the natural beach attributes than facilities available at the beaches. In the overall sample, beach visitors are satisfied the least with lifeguard and/or medical service = 2.90, accessibility to the beach and sea for persons with disabilities = 2.97, rental service of water sport and recreation equipment = 3.12, parking space availability = 3.12, shower availability = 3.13, toilet cleanliness = 3.15 and toilet availability = 3.24. Beach visitors are satisfied the most with bar and restaurant service on the beaches = 3.99, clearly designated safe swimming areas in the sea = 3.88, litter bin availability = 3.88 and with areas for sport, recreation, and children play on the beaches = 3.81. Concerning the descriptive analyses of beach visitor emotional experiences, measured on the Destination Emotion Scale (DES), on average beach visitors feel joy = 4.21 the most, followed by the emotion of love = 3.84 and positive surprise = 3.69. Beach visitor satisfaction with the overall experience at the beaches is on average relatively high = 4.29, as are the intention of revisit = 4.49, and the intention of recommending the beach = 4.35 The results of the bivariate statistical analysis show significant statistical differences in overall experience satisfaction regarding visitor type, while no differences were found by age or gender. Domestic tourists are least satisfied on average, while season residents are satisfied the most. The results partially support hypothesis H1. Significant statistical differences were found in the construct of intention of recommendation by gender and age. Women have a higher intention to recommend the beach than men. Age groups of 15-24 years of age tend to recommend the beach the least, while age groups of 45-54 and 55-64 have the highest levels of recommendation intention. These results partially support hypothesis H2, as no differences were found by beach visitor type. Women also have a higher intention of revisit the beach then men, while local residents and season residents have significantly higher intention of revisit than tourists, partially supporting hypothesis H3, as no differences by age were found. Lastly, the results of multivariate statistical analysis show that satisfaction with natural beach characteristics affects satisfaction with the overall experience at the beach (β=0.529, p<.01), intention to revisit (β=0.37, p<.01) and intention to recommend (β=0.497, p<.01). Thus, confirming hypothesis H4, H5 and H6. Satisfaction with beach facilities affects the overall experience satisfaction with the beach (β=0.189, p<.01), the intention to revisit (β=0.146, p<.01) and the intention to recommend the beach (β=0.106, p<.01) confirming hypotheses H7, H8 and H9. Concerning the impact of beach visitor emotions on the overall beach experience, the results show that joy (β=0.437, p<.01), love (β=0.203, p<.01) and positive surprise (β=0.105, p<.05) have a significant impact. Confirming in this way hypothesis H10. The impact of emotions on revisit intention is also statistically significant for joy (β=0.442, p<.01) and love (β=0.266, p<.01), while positive surprise is not related to revisit intention (β=0.061, p=0.271). By this, hypothesis H11 is partially confirmed. Concerning the effect of emotions on recommendation intention, both joy (β=0.445, p<.01) and love (β=0.27, p<.01) affect recommendation intention, while the relationship with positive surprise is not statistically significant (β=0.047, p=0.333). The results confirm partially hypothesis H12. Satisfaction with overall beach experience is significantly related to the intention of revisit (β=0.585, p<.01) and with the intention of recommendation (β=0.597, p<.01) confirming hypothesis H13 and H14 respectively. Mediation analysis results indicate that emotions partially mediate the relationship between satisfaction with natural beach characteristics and overall experience at the beach, while complete mediation of emotions is established between satisfaction with beach facilities and overall experience satisfaction. Finally, confirming hypothesis H15 and H16 respectively. Originality of the research In an innovative approach, while responding to the calls of several authors from the literature of tourism and marketing for the creation of integrative models of satisfaction with both cognitive and affective components, the Destination Emotion Scale (DES) is used in the context of modelling overall beach visitors’ satisfaction affective component. Furthermore, by assessing the importance of beach facilities at the natural beach, opposed to satisfaction with beach facilities on beaches in urban areas at the same time, an innovative integral assessment of wider coastal area beaches is enabled no matter the beach type. This is achieved by the combination of satisfaction and importance measurements of beach facilities in the overall beach sample. In this manner, the importance of facilities at the natural beach, becomes a control variable, and the results of independent variable attribute level statistical significance measurements may be interpreted as significant, controlling for the fact that beach visitors may have different priorities regarding facilities on the natural beach in a rural setting, than visitors of beaches in urban settings. This dissertation establishes the applicative, theoretical, and empirical validity of the observation of beaches as tourism products. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how this approach incorporates the principles of sustainable development while simultaneously being oriented towards some of the most important theoretical determinants of successful business operations – visitor satisfaction and future behavioural intentions. By assessing the reliability and validity of the empirical model and testing the proposed scientific hypotheses, new insights into the area of beach visitor satisfaction have been explored and revealed, these insights establish emotions as a reliable predictor of beach visitor satisfaction and future behavioural intentions and include different emotional experiences of visitors on a natural beach in a rural environment. © 2022, University of Rijeka.

"This paper provides an empirical insight into how geopolitical risks impact international tourism demand. An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid-19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre-crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy-makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post-crisis, policy-makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re-establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Lee C.-C.; Olasehinde-Williams G.; Akadiri S.S.,Strategic,10.1002/jtr.2389,covid-19; geopolitical risk; second-generation panel; tourism,5.0,,10,5,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"The abstract discusses the long-term impacts of geopolitical risks on tourism demand and suggests policy recommendations for crisis management and recovery marketing strategies, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,70,10,Geopolitical risk and tourism: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel models,2021
"In recent years, the world has gone through, and continues to go through, periods that no one anticipated, and on the contrary, society excluded as even possible. In 2019, COVID-19 and its global pandemic appeared. In 2022, the war in Ukraine began. The whole world and society in particular, is thus facing a completely new reality and the changes that this reality brings. More than ever, human values and psychological aspects are coming into the centre of interest and attention. Within companies and business, especially marketing and marketing communication must react and adapt to these changes and trends. Their importance is growing primarily as tools for achieving company goals. The branding phenomenon is closely linked to marketing and communication. The brand, its image, persona, values, opinions, attitudes, but also its emotional state and archetype, these are the key factors for its current success and its power. The aim of our study is to describe the current state and trends in the field of marketing and marketing communication in close connection with the brand, which is essential for the success of the company. In the next part our study focuses on the brand primarily from a psychological point of view. The theoretical part is followed by the research part, in which we analyse in detail the studies by Kantar agency, which were focused, on the one hand, on the consumers, changes in their behaviour and decision-making, and on the other hand on the brand, its position and communication in times of crisis. Our objective was to identify key factors and recommendations for these areas that are appropriate and beneficial to apply in business practice. © 2022, Communication Today.

"Sustainability marketing has emerged as an important trend both in practice and academic literature. The relevant literature has heavily focused on determinations of sustainable consumer behavior, and practitioners have used these results to derive short-term marketing decisions, e.g., adequate pricing of sustainable products. However, no study has scrutinized derivations of sustainable brand personalities or provided important long-term, strategic, managerial implications for marketing managers of sustainable brands. This study aims to contribute to this underrepre-sented research field and makes recommendations for preferred brand personality dimensions for sustainable brands. First, the personality structure of sustainable consumers by using a preference-based two-step segmentation approach is investigated, and subsequent profiling of the sustainable consumer segment is conducted. The research relies on the results of an empirical discrete choice experiment and a personality test, including the data of a representative German consumer sample. Sustainable consumers were found to be highly agreeable and open. Second, the personality results of sustainable consumers are linked to consumers’ personality-specific preferred brand personalities. Third, recommendations for harmonic brand personality dimensions for sustainable brands, e.g., competence, excitement, and sincerity, are derived, and therefore, long-term, strategic, managerial implications are provided. © 2021 by the author.

"Research of business interaction in marketing channels is often associated with the necessity to study the optimal business game scenarios, which provide the best implementation of enterprises business behavior strategies and maximize their profits. In such situati ons involvement of game-theoretic modeling apparatus in the process of determining key factors influencing profits formation of manufacturers and retailers, contributes to a better understanding of the cause and the effect relationships between the magnitude of profits, interpreted in the form of indicators of business strategies, and creates the prerequisites for finding ways of sharing joint profits in marketing channels. The purpose of study is to find optimal values in terms of channel members profits maximizing of the parameters of the advertising cost response function, in which the manufacturer and the retailer by agreement make decisions on the implementation of business game strategies, including pricing strategies and strategies for generating joint advertising costs. The paper presents a numerical experiment on the possible values of the parameters of the advertising cost response function, which takes into account the recommendations of the practice of enterprises functioning in distribution channels. Mathematical calculations have been made, which allow to build a model of cooperative game of the manufacturer and the retailer, based on the non-dimensional form of retail price values as well as values of joint advertising costs. The optimal solution of cooperative game, which within the numerical experiment is presented as the possible maximum values of profits of the manufacturer, the retailer and the vertical marketing channel, is made. The comparative analysis of the soluti ons of cooperative game and non-cooperative game, which involves the formation of Nash equilibrium, is given to determine the benefits of cooperative game model for both participants of the vertical marketing channel in terms of maximizing their profits and profit of the channel as a whole. The results obtained can be an information base for further calculations and comparisons of cooperative and non-cooperative models as interactions between participants of supply chains. In addition, the results of numerical simulations form the initial base for comparisons with other variants of cooperative game model, which involve changing a range and a step change of output values of the model. © 2020 IJSTR.",Danyliuk N.; Zhemba A.; Dyma O.; Sazonets O.; Kachan O.,Strategic,,Advertising cost response function; Business game strategy; Cooperative game; Nash equilibrium; Profit; Retail price; Transfer price,5.0,,10,0,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,"The abstract discusses the use of game-theoretic modeling to identify optimal business strategies for maximizing profits in marketing channels.

"Based on the internationalization of higher education in the current global highly compet-itive education market, the current study aims to explore the factors affecting students in the selection of the country to continue their higher education. Following the mixed-method approach, the researchers collected data from international students studying in Germany and the United King-dom (UK). The qualitative phase identified six themes: academic, social, personal, financial, career, and marketing as the highly influential elements in students’ choice to study abroad. Empirical analyses indicate that students in both countries consider academic reputation as a dominant theme in the selection of country for HEI. However, noteworthy differences were identified in the subse-quent themes. Moreover, international students in Germany were found more satisfied with their choice of the country as compared to the students in the UK. This study provides valuable insights to the academic policymakers in the host and home countries concerning factors that pull and push students to study abroad. It also proposes recommendations to counter the brain drain element. © 2021 by the authors.

"Purpose: Earlier work has suggested that assumptions, values and beliefs about the importance of cooperating with competitors (a coopetition-oriented mindset) should manifest into behavioural forms of coopetition, such as resource and capability-sharing activities. Yet, limited research surrounds the complexities of this link. The purpose of this study is to unpack the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and coopetition-oriented behaviours under the moderating roles of industry experience and degree of internationalization, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view. Design/methodology/approach: The chosen empirical context was the Canadian wine industry because wine producers are often involved in coopetition strategies and have varying degrees of internationalisation. Preliminary interview data were collected from 18 managers to shape the operationalisations. Then survey data were collected from 195 Canadian wine producers. After checking the statistical data for all major assessments of reliability and validity (together with common method variance), the hypothesised and control paths were tested through hierarchical regression. Findings: A coopetition-oriented mindset had a positive and significant association with coopetition-oriented behaviours. Surprisingly, this link was negatively moderated by industry experience. Additionally, degree of internationalisation yielded a positive moderation effect. These moderators highlight situations where a coopetition-oriented mindset is (and is not) likely to manifest into coopetition activities. Practical implications: If firms aim to engage in behavioural forms of coopetition, they should manage assumptions, values and beliefs associated with the advantages of collaborating with their competitors. Industry experience can limit the extent to which business’ coopetition-oriented mindsets manifest into coopetition-oriented behaviours. This could be explained by decision makers possessing information that discourages them from working with certain (untrustworthy) rivals because of the potential harmful effects on their performance. Companies should use their industry experience to avoid working with rival entities that will create negative outcomes, such as tensions (e.g., conflict, power imbalances and opportunistic behaviours), lost intellectual property and diluted competitive advantages. Nonetheless, industry experience might signify that there are more risks than rewards linked with these business-to-business marketing strategies. Higher levels of internationalisation can help firms to recognise that coopetition-oriented behaviours may lead to performance-enhancing opportunities in their overseas markets. Originality/value: This investigation contributes to the business-to-business marketing literature with new evidence on how organisations can foster a coopetition-oriented mindset to engage in coopetition strategies. The negative moderation effect from industry experience highlights that knowledge of competitors’ activities can limit the extent to which coopetition-oriented behaviours are implemented. Moreover, the positive interaction effect from degree of internationalisation extends the growing body of knowledge pertaining to coopetition in an international arena. Collectively, these results show that while a coopetition-oriented mindset is a critical driver of coopetition-oriented behaviours, there are certain contingencies that can strengthen or weaken this association. Finally, by integrating resource-based theory and the relational view, this paper could explore the different forms of coopetition, in terms of organisation-wide mindsets and firm-level behaviours. This paper concludes with some managerial recommendations, alongside a series of limitations and avenues for future research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Crick J.M.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-03-2020-0165,Coopetition-oriented behaviours; Coopetition-oriented mindsets; Degree of internationalisation; Industry experience; Relational view; Resource-based theory,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and behaviours, focusing on how these concepts can influence long-term strategies in business, particularly in the context of the Canadian wine industry.

"Experiential marketing is being considered by researchers and marketers as an alternative solution to traditional marketing for achieving the best results for organisational lifetime value. However, network operators are preoccupied with traditional marketing programmes and strategies, which have produced limited results (value). This study sought to utilise experiential marketing as a tool to create value for mobile network operators, as well as provide recommendations to avoid future gaps. This study utilised a positivistic paradigm and a quantitative approach through a self-administered, structured hard copy questionnaire for data collection. Stratification and convenience sampling techniques were used to select participants from each of the regional offices of the network operators in Ghana. The database of the national communication authority (NCA) of Ghana was accessed to identify the number of registered operators and the associated subscribed customers in the country. A total of 415 customers responded to the survey. The study concluded that experiential marketing had a positive and sustainable influence on value (business value). It is envisaged that this study could assist network operators and other businesses to create value by understanding the factors influencing experiential marketing, thereby assisting in the formulation of effective and efficient strategies and decisions. Furthermore, this study offers practical recommendations that could strengthen businesses when establishing experiential marketing programmes. Additionally, this study enhances the body of knowledge regarding experiential marketing and value creation in the context of mobile network operators. © 2022 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

"Purpose: The use of threats to force supplier compliance is a common practice in current business affairs. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the supplier’s decision process to comply to or resist such a coercive strategy. The paper aims to develop a more comprehensive view of the decision process used by suppliers when threatened by their customers, as well as discover new phenomena regarding supplier Decision-Making Under Threat (DUT). More specifically, it aims at (1) gaining a better understanding of threats by looking at their patterns and commonalities and (2) identifying which consideration factors are relevant when suppliers evaluate threats. Method: To identify which consideration factors are relevant to suppliers when deciding how to react to threats, the study employed an exploratory approach by interviewing 17 marketing practitioners with experiences in DUT. The in-depth interviews lasted between thirty-five and sixty-five minutes and were transcribed. Descriptive coding and template analysis generated thirty-nine descriptors and nine categories that are deemed important when considering DUT. The authors also evaluated the intensity of each of the consideration factors present in the decision process. Findings: The results reveal that it is possible to categorize threats into three components: Objectives, Penalties and Manifestations. Objectives are what the customer is trying to achieve by using the threat, namely demanding price reductions, appropriating intellectual property, procuring financial statements, receiving a bribe, increasing technical requirements, accessing a cost breakdown, modifying delivery terms, and modifying payment terms. The penalty is what the supplier can expect to happen when refusing to comply, such as losing the customer’s sales. Finally, manifestations describe how the threat is presented by the customer. Study results show that these manifestations may be categorized according to their level of ambiguity, predictability, and candor. The results also reveal that at least five cognitive decision criteria are typically considered during the decision process although at different intensity levels from each participant. These criteria include: Dependence, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Relationship Quality, Relational Norm Violations, and Mimetic Isomorphism. Several interesting discoveries were made. For example, Dependence is both the consideration factor for which most people emphasized its influence on their decision and for which most people said that it had no influence at all. Relational norm violations is unique by being the only criterion for which no participant mentioned that it does not influence their decision. The overwhelming majority of study participants considered more than three criteria during the DUT process. Finally, participants said that they experienced negative emotions such as anger and frustration when exposed to threats albeit most did not recognize that it played a role in their decision. These emotions are however believed to be a factor in reducing the supplier’s willingness to comply. Overall, the study finds that DUT is a complex decision process regarding supplier adaptation, and can be a highly emotional experience with long-lasting effects. Research implications: The face-to-face interviews used to collect narratives of participants being exposed to customer threats is deemed an appropriate and highly recommendable methodological approach. When collecting data on reactions to threats and their accompanying emotional reaction several non-verbal signs that the participants physically demonstrated were an essential component in fully interpreting the data. As such, future research on the topic could include video recordings of the interviews. The narratives were also very efficient in recalling the emotions associated with the coercive event though the interviews sometimes occurred several years afterward. The participants’ opinions are consistent with academia’s view regarding the ambiguous role of emotions during decision-making. On the one hand, emotions are recognized to play an important role, they should be acknowledged and understood, while on the other hand, many believe that emotions should not contaminate the decision process. By combining five cognitive criteria with emotions in a DUT framework, the paper incorporates knowledge from the field of psychology into the business-to-business marketing literature. The article highlights the fact that the study of both threats in a business setting and the role of emotions in decision-making are neglected topics that deserve more academic attention. Practical implications: From the customer’s perspective an improved understanding of the supplier’s DUT may help customers limit the damage to relationships when using coercive influence strategies such as threats. From the supplier’s perspective, the results emphasize the importance to decompose their customer’s threat in order to better respond to its use. By also taking into account all consideration factors suppliers can take better quality decisions. The results provide several recommendations such as to include intangibles in the cost-benefit analysis instead of solely focusing on the short-term financial impact. Emotional control has been stressed by the participants as a key managerial ability to master when faced with threats. Originality/value/contribution: By merging the influence strategy research stream and the supplier adaptation research stream together, the study generates a few original and noteworthy contributions. A better understanding of threats is garnered by breaking them down into three components, which consequently extends our understanding of influence strategies. The study also contributes to a deeper understanding of the supplier’s DUT, a new concept described in the paper, by identifying how decision makers include multiple criteria in their decision process. Very few academic papers have specifically looked into threats as a coercive strategy despite its prevalent use in business environments. Those that did focused on a limited set of criteria when analyzing the decision to adapt. The article expands on these previous studies by proposing five decision criteria, which are often considered collectively by participants when examining adaptation under threat, and emphasizes a factor neglected in previous research, namely the role of emotions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bourguignon B.; Boeck H.; Clarke T.B.,Strategic,10.1080/1051712X.2020.1831210,buyer-seller relationships; decision process; emotions; influence strategies; Threats,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the decision-making process of suppliers under threats, highlighting long-term implications of coercive strategies in business relationships.

"The 2018-2019 Student Affairs Standing Committee addressed charges related to examining the institutional leadership models and professional development needs of faculty and staff to optimize achievement of Strategic Priority #1 on the applicant pipeline. The report provides five recommendations to AACP and twelve suggestions for colleges and schools of pharmacy. The committee focused on the need to develop tailored leadership training and mentoring programs for admissions personnel on relevant topics, including change management, holistic thinking, leadership, problem solving, technical knowledge, professional development, paths for promotion, conflict resolution, networking, persuasive communication, and strategic planning. Rather than develop new resources, the committee identified existing professional competencies and assessment resources developed by other organizations for student affairs and admissions personnel that could spur enhanced strategic marketing and professional development opportunities in pharmacy education. It also reaffirmed the need for student diversity and the use of data to drive strategic decisions in recruitment. To identify gaps in knowledge among AACP member institutions, the committee analyzed the results of its fall 2018 survey on the current depth and breadth of student recruitment activities and their perceived effectiveness. The committee also recommended ways institutions can encourage faculty and others outside of the admissions office to participate in student recruitment activities. Finally, the committee concluded that it will be necessary for colleges and schools to collaborate across the academy to promote the benefits of pharmacy profession to prospective students, rather than individual colleges and schools of pharmacy, and be more responsive to the expectations of Gen Z students before the tide in applications will shift in a positive direction. © 2019, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine health-related social advertisements to identify its use and evaluate its appropriateness to situational needs, such as epidemic dynamics and the context where it is implemented. The paper also discusses the barriers that policymakers face in creating these linkages. Design/methodology/approach: In all, 375 national HIV/AIDS prevention television advertisements from France, Germany, Portugal and Italy were viewed and analyzed over time of production, exploring the sources, the target audiences and the messages delivered. This paper compares management choices with HIV epidemics in each country and their contextual profiles. Findings: The findings of this paper indicate that social advertising concerned with HIV/AIDS prevention is commonly framed within public policies and does not usually target the most vulnerable and affected populations. Furthermore, social ads are reactive to epidemic dynamics. The existence of trade-offs between putting forward theoretical marketing recommendations and taking account of contextual fracturing issues or increasing stigma and discrimination are also considered. Research limitations/implications: This paper is useful for public sector management because of the importance of evaluating the investments done to improve future strategies.

"Purpose: Despite the remarkable growth of the luxury industry, a phenomenon referred to as luxury fever, as well as the growing interest in word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing in the industry at hand, little is known about how consumers’ perceived leadership of luxury brands dynamically influences their WOM behavior. This paper aims to examine the moderating role of a type of luxuries (accessible vs inaccessible) in the relationship between the four dimensions of perceived brand leadership – quality, value, innovativeness and popularity – and consumers’ WOM recommendation intention. Design/methodology/approach: The current research is based on survey data gathered from 333 actual customers who attend five golf clubs located in North Florida. An innovative data analysis procedure that combines structural equation modeling with propensity score analysis to estimate the moderating effects, controlling for selection bias, is presented. Findings: Quality was the significant predictor of WOM among consumers of inaccessible luxuries (private club). In contrast, financial value and popularity were key factors in predicting WOM of individuals who chose accessible luxuries (public club). Originality/value: This paper attempts to shed new light on the field of strategic luxury marketing by addressing differential consumption decision-making processes corresponding to hierarchically constructed luxury services.

"The literature on referencing takes a firm stance on the value that vendors derive from marketing customer references. What the literature lacks, however, is empirical work that supports our current understanding of the value of customer references to the potential customer. The present exploratory research aims to demonstrate the value of customer references from the perspective of the potential customer. This goal will be achieved by considering a single case study that provides evidence for the value of customer references to potential customers in business markets. Three theoretical propositions emerge as key conceptual contributions: (a) customer references allow buying companies to establish their suppliers’ competence, assess the buying decision risk and forecast return on investment; (b) customer references deliver value by helping potential customers to identify new business needs and (c) potential customers benefit from being exposed to customer references insofar as they are sources of organizational learning.

"Purpose: Mobile social media (MSM), an interaction, exchange of information and creation of user-generated content, mediated by mobile devices, is becoming the locomotive that drives forward evolution of the online world. Fewer academic studies have touched upon the MSM subject, with all the papers being of a conceptual nature to provide recommendations to business-to-business (B2B) firms. This paper aims to explore how B2B firms use MSM in reality. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts the grounded theory approach to analyse interviews conducted in 26 B2B firms representing the UK advertising and marketing sector. Interviewees represent key decision-makers who understand the aspects of mobile technology use in their firms. Eighteen firms stressed the importance of social media as a trigger to adopt mobile devices. Follow-up data collection in these 18 firms focus on strategic orientation, processes, routines and skills required for using MSM. Findings: This paper found that marketing and advertising firms use MSM for branding, sensing market, managing relationships and developing content. MSM is treated by businesses as a strategic firm-specific capability that drives firms’ competitiveness, where imitation of such capability by competitors is limited because MSM skills are specific to individuals within organisations and MSM routines are manifested as a result of firm-specific MSM skills’ interactions. Originality/value: This study is amongst the first to provide insights into B2B firms’ practices of using MSM. Additionally, the research is novel because it discovers that MSM capability is developed as a result of the overlap between individuals’ and organisational knowledge and memory, contradicting existing theory on the subject. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bolat E.; Kooli K.; Wright L.T.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-10-2016-270,Capability approach; Grounded theory; Mobile technology; Social media,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The paper explores how B2B firms use mobile social media (MSM) as a strategic capability that drives competitiveness, emphasizing the long-term implications for the organization in terms of branding, market sensing, and relationship management.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Businesses and mobile social media capability,2016
"Conservation marketing draws upon social marketing and psychology to address the human dimensions of biodiversity loss. Behavioural scientists with expertise in conservation psychology can contribute to the design of research projects in this field that utilize a variety of methodologies (quantitative and qualitative), formal application for approval of methodology and procedure through relevant human and animal research ethics committees, and implementation and evaluation of projects or campaigns that are based on psychological principles of persuasion, attitude, and behavior change with the aim of protecting biodiversity. Interdisciplinary projects utilizing best practice in conservation psychology, community-based social marketing, and conservation marketing are likely to lead to improved outcomes, such as reductions in human consumption patterns and other unsustainable behaviors and increases in community engagement. A closer relationship between conservation psychology and conservation marketing will lead to publications of research in high-impact peer-reviewed journals, offering practical recommendations for conservation practitioners, as well as reaching laypeople. Importantly, communicating successes and failures of different approaches, projects or campaigns will help conservation practitioners, conservation educators, tourism operators, community groups, policy-makers, and other stakeholders make informed decisions and design effective conservation marketing campaigns based on evidence. © 2019, AESS.",Ryan J.C.; Mellish S.; Le Busque B.R.; Litchfield C.A.,Strategic,10.1007/s13412-019-00565-w,Behavioral science; Biodiversity loss; Conservation education; Conservation marketing; Conservation psychology; Social science,5.0,,10,5,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses the long-term goals of conservation marketing and its relationship with conservation psychology, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to achieve sustainable outcomes.

"Purpose: This research aims to predict private club members’ intentions to switch service providers based on the benefit exchange theory through a structural model with a second-order factor. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative procedure to develop a functional, social and psychological model based on the benefit exchange and switching intention literatures. A further quantitative analysis surveyed a sample of 366 private club members and assessed the usefulness of this model. Findings: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling indicate that social benefits have a stronger impact on switching intention than loss of functional benefits under the context of a high level of interaction between members and between members and service providers. In addition, they confirm the moderating effects of psychological benefits on the relationship between functional benefits and switching intention. Practical implications: The findings indicate that members are unlikely to switch if there are positive word of mouth and interpersonal interactions between members and the club (social benefits). Even if they are disappointed with the functional benefits of the club’s products or services, they may still choose to stay with it owing to psychological benefits affecting their decision to switch. The findings offer managerial insights into utilizing relationship marketing activities to strengthen interpersonal relationships, word of mouth, trust, commitment and emotional factors to retain members. Originality/value: This research confirms that the benefit exchange theory can explain members’ intentions to switch from their current clubs and provides valuable recommendations to managers on retaining their clubs’ members. Because the switching intentions of club members have not previously been adequately studied, this study fills an important gap in the literature. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Chuang Y.-F.; Tai Y.-F.,Strategic,10.1108/IJCHM-10-2014-0514,Benefit exchange; Consumer behavior; Hospitality; Membership; Private club; Switching intention,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The research focuses on understanding and predicting private club members' intentions to switch service providers, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and member retention strategies.

"Naming a product's scent is a key decision. The same scent can be interpreted differently when different names are assigned to it. Thus, choosing the right scent name can increase competitiveness by successfully appealing to desired consumer segments. We propose that such decisions should be data driven (i.e., on the basis of competitors’ offerings and consumers’ preferences) and provide guidelines on how to assign scent names to products in home care and personal care product categories, focusing on capturing market segments. Based on a large web-based dataset of scented products across multiple brands and categories, this article is the first to construct a typology of scent names empirically: unscented, concrete, abstract, and proprietary. After examining firms’ assortments of scented products with different names across 12 categories and comparing them with consumers’ preferences concerning such assortments, we identify major gaps. Overall, consumers demand far more unscented products and products with abstract names than currently offered; however, preferences for products with proprietary names are mostly aligned. Strategic recommendations center on naming scented products to better align supply and demand in the scented product market and capture new market opportunities. © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Meng H.M.; Zamudio C.; Jewell R.D.,Strategic,10.1016/j.bushor.2018.01.004,Data-driven decision making; Market segmentation; Retail marketing; Scented products; Sensory marketing,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of naming scents to better align with consumer preferences and market opportunities, indicating a focus on strategic planning and decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Unlocking competitiveness through scent names: A data-driven approach,2018
"Net Promoter Score, touted as the “single customer metric you need” and calculated from customers' answer to one simple question about their loyalty, has been in use since 2003 and adopted in a wide variety of settings. However, it has not lived up to its claimed benefits. This article evaluates the NPS approach in terms of its positive and negative results. This article is for people interested in NPS, still considering implementing NPS in their company, or interested in its technical underpinnings. It points out the benefits and shortcomings and explains why, and it describes what can be done to achieve the outcomes NPS theory claimed it would produce, but has not. The article is written in two parts for quite distinct audiences: firstly, for executives and managers who need customer data and information to make marketing decisions; and secondly, for market researchers, statisticians, and business analysts who are responsible for capturing and providing reliable, understandable, and meaningful customer data to the executives and managers who need the information. Consequently, the two sections are written in two different styles. The first section takes the form of a summary for managers and executives of our findings and recommendations in language aimed at business leaders; the second section provides a detailed analysis and critical review of NPS for market researchers, statisticians, and business analysts.

"This paper proposes to investigate solar energy applied patents published between 1997 and 2016. Social network analysis and Source path link count algorithms are used as a method to identify technological routes, trends, promising technologies, cooperation features and market of interest protection. Patents applied in Japan and Brazil were selected for analysis of several issues, showing two different contexts when it comes to innovation in solar energy. Mapping these issues can support governments, companies and universities in their decisions about solar energy applications, offering data of the most relevant technologies, their owners, relationships between them, as well as their marketing protection coverage through reliable and replicable metrics. It enables an analysis of competitive technological intelligence and can be used as a tool for Research and Development manager's decisions of future efforts and investments. Companies can observe in a simplified way, standards that are followed and adopted by scientists and market, bringing a possibility of increasing technological knowledge that previously had only empirical means. In addition, government can understand the dynamic of solar energy development from/to their countries and propose policies that improve the use of solar energy in an urban environment.

"In settings characterized by frequent product entries and rapid market exit, predicting innovation success is a difficult task. The challenge in such short life-cycle markets is exacerbated when the offering is an experience good (i.e., product quality is not known prior to consumption). This article investigates a variety of information disequilibrium-reducing cues that can signal a new product's quality, and posit that those cues affect knowledge of and attitude toward (i.e., customers' mindset) the item, and in turn, demand. The work draws on signaling theory in an experience good context (motion pictures) to set up a nomological net that includes three sources of quality cues as predictors of consumer demand, namely: (i) traditional prelaunch decisions (e.g., production budget, advertising budget, and sequel), (ii) volume and valence of movie critics' reviews, and (iii) text contained in the movie critics' reviews. Based on a stratified, random sample of movie introductions (n = 115), the results show that the prelaunch (structured numeric) variables alone explain a meaningful proportion of the variance in domestic box office sales. The postlaunch (structured numeric) variables, volume and valence of critics' reviews, add more explanatory power, and analyzing over two million words from the (unstructured) text of critics' reviews adds further explanatory power. This research answers a recent call to model the variety of structured and unstructured variables to predict innovation success in data-rich environments, and thereby represents the pioneering study to combine all three sources of quality cues—(i) prelaunch, structured variables; (ii) postlaunch, structured variables; and (iii) postlaunch, unstructured variables derived from text reviews—as determinants of demand. The approach taken also substantiates film as innovation and as an interesting case of new product development. For managers in a short life-cycle, experience good settings, the results support the inclusion of a broader “variety” of quality signals to improve forecasting in today's data-rich environments. Practitioner Points: The results here highlight the importance of considering both marketing decisions and expert reviews in forecasting approaches for new product launches. Exploring a nuanced approach to analyzing expert reviews seems to be particularly promising in predicting product successes and failures. This research also helps us develop a deeper understanding of the nature of critics' reviews. Beyond just “thumbs up/thumbs down” sort of recommendations, we identify specific words that are influential in making an impression on consumers and, ultimately, driving product success or failure. This work also emphasizes the challenges of predicting success in markets for short life-cycle experience goods such as films. In these markets, expert reviews likely carry even more weight since consumers have great difficulty in assessing the product in advance. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",Bharadwaj N.; Noble C.H.; Tower A.; Smith L.M.; Dong Y.,Strategic,10.1111/jpim.12404,,5.0,,10,0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of understanding consumer demand and innovation success in short life-cycle markets, particularly in the context of predicting outcomes based on various quality cues.

"For two decades, fair trade has served as an alternative approach of trading that encourages minimal returns, sustainability, and ethics, by offering producers in developing countries better trading conditions and secured rights. This movement has emerged recently in China, with companies involving domestic trading between richer and poorer regions. However, lack of third-party certification, standardization, process control, public awareness, and brand recognition continue to be challenges. To understand the current fair trade business in China, this paper investigates important decision-making areas from a supply chain management perspective. With the nature of empirical studies, an in-depth case analysis of a fair trade craft company has been conducted along with the purchasing and supplier relationship management, internal operations, and marketing and customer relationship management. This company currently combines the role of fair trade organization and retailer, by implementing an in-house certification system and vertically integrating the supply chain. Findings also highlight risk at each stage of supply chain. Compared with the western society, the unique features of Chinese fair trade business are captured with prioritized areas for improvement. This research contributes to the fair trade literature by providing exploratory study into emerging issues in the supply chain, particularly inside developing countries.

"The conditions of the functioning of state higher education institutions at the present stage of development of the Ukrainian economy require new approaches to solve the problem of the relationship between the volume of training of specialists with higher education and their employment in the sphere of economic activity. The purpose of this article was to provide theoretical substantiation and practical recommendations for the development of a higher education institution development strategy for making managerial innovative decisions on balancing the demand and supply of educational services in a competitive environment. The following methods were used in the study: abstract logical; comparative economic and system structural; statistical; sociological; modeling; the algorithm of practical application of the theory of constraints of systems; and the apparatus of the theory of fuzzy sets. Methodological approaches to the implementation of the optimal allocation of budget places of the university by means of a practical application of system restriction theory and fuzzy set theory were proposed. The result was the allocation of budgetary places, taking into account the demand for specialties in terms of the economic situation of the region, the demand in the labor market, the demand among entrants, and the proposal of the institution of higher education and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. It will make it possible to reach the optimum balance between demand for specialists in specific specialties and their supply.

"Introduction. In the conditions of continuous change and bifurcations of the marketing environment, the system of management of marketing commodity policy (SMMCP) of online retailers is impacted by a set of immanent components, the inclusion of which makes it possible to multiply the efficiency of their functioning in the cyber space and timely adjust the plan to implement marketing activities. In this regard, the urgency in substantiating, systematising the immanent components (quantitative measurement) and developing practical principals relevant to the assessment of the impact of such components on the SMMCP of online retailers based on the use of a multidimensional simulation method is becoming more relevant. The purpose of this article is to develop canonical models for assessing the impact of partial immanent components (quantitative measurement) on the SMMCP of online retailers, taking into account the corresponding latent root causes. In order to automate calculations and construct canonical models, the authors of the article use the demo version of the «STATISTICA» software package. Results. The author of the article has substantiated and systematised the immanent components and their impact on the SMMCP of online retailers (quantitative measurement), as well as the root causes of the formation of the SMMCP of online retailers that determine the partial immanent components of impact, and explained the correlation between the corresponding attributes, giving their meaningful interpretation. Consequently, canonical models for assessing of partial immanent components of impact on the SMMCP of online retailers, the implementation of which is the basis for making effective marketing decisions and achievement of corresponding goals by applying managerial impact locally.

"Objectives Despite being a strategic sector of Galician's economy, the dairy sector has been traditionally characterized by its small-scale. This factor can inhibit the competitive potential of the companies operating in this area, mainly cooperatives. This paper provides an overview of the steps taken towards the consolidation of a second-degree cooperative known as CLUN -Cooperativas Lácteas Unidas. This process, taken together with a new merger (Aira, SCG) redefines the agrarian cooperative sector as well as the Galician dairy one. We start by providing a brief analysis of the dairy sector in Spain and Galicia to depict the general context in which this study is undertook. Then, we outline the setting up of CLUN as a concentration process on the Galician agrarian sector. We analyze both the former companies which jointly manage the second-degree one, and the different stages carried out. Next, we identify the major remaining changes to be resolved on the medium term and the main conclusions of the process. Finally, we set up several recommendations regarding the success of this process and other similar consolidations. Taken this into account, our main objective is to further the study in the role of the size and the concentration processes on the competitiveness of cooperatives, shedding light on the main factors that can might improve -or inhibit- these processes. In sum, we aim to analyze the threats and opportunities that mergers generate when are implemented, and to provide information about some factors that can improve the opportunities towards a successful concentration. Method In order to accomplish our goals, we used a mixed method. First, a review of the main indicators of the agrarian cooperatives -both in Spain and Galicia- has been conducted. This enables us to contextualize our study. Second, we conducted a broad review on the academic literature related to this field, focusing on both those papers that highlight the importance of the size of cooperatives on competitiveness and those that carried out research on concentration processes. Finally, we introduce some issues that suggest the convenience of using a qualitative approach. More specifically, we aim to obtain some information about the business-case as perceived by its internal stakeholders. In this respect, some managers were interviewed to identify the main factors they found interesting related to the topic. Results Since the first consolidated income statement has not been approved to date, it is early to determine the financial success of the integration process. However, it is possible to identify some of the factors that have been traditionally related to the competitiveness of agro-food companies: size, diversification and market orientation. Therefore, it might be suggested that the CLUN's creation represents a daring commitment to improve the competitiveness on the dairy sector. In addition, we can highlight several practices that seem to favor the implementation. Some of them are related to the idiosyncrasy of the organizations, while others arose as a result of the procedures implemented along the integration. In the first place, although the three former companies were linked on their corporate object, the different specialization's focuses make them complementary. Thus, Feiraco plays a leading role in marketing and distribution; Os Irmandiños in the manufacture of feed and Melisanto has an important portfolio of services for its members. This complementarity helped, for example, to avoid the transfer of personnel and to facilitate the establishment of the decision centers at headquarters. Secondly, we would like to highlight the background on organizational knowledge that the three cooperatives had among themselves, since they had previously shared business in recent years. This mutual knowledge leads to improve the opportunities to undertake merger' processes in a natural way and to overcome in turn possible frictions. This circumstance, taken together with the coincidence on the company kind and also with the observance of the principles of the Corporate Governance within cooperatives, seems to suggest that they have similar business cultures. This factor is crucial for the success of any concentration process, since that in addition to the financial and organizational adjustment social alignment is essential. Therefore, the combination of a similar business culture and a coordinated management team can help in the successful accomplishment of the integration. However, we claim the need to advance in the equalization of rights, obligations and benefits among workers, in order to reduce some risks in the integration. Finally, it should be noted that there was a common choice of the external and independent stakeholder for the realization of the valuation proposal and subsequent determination of the percentage of participation of each organization in the resulting entity. In this way, a process that could be a source of conflict is carried out in a widely accepted way. In future research it would be interesting to analyze whether these factors could be hierarchized, and also if there are significant differences between the different stakeholders that have participated in the concentration. Namely, if managers of cooperatives have opinions that are statistically different from those provided by workers or external stakeholders. In addition, it could be explored whether types of factors could be established. For instance, social, organizational and financial ones. Contribution This work helps to increase the existing evidence about concentration processes in cooperatives. This kind of business have proven to be a successful way to reduce the unemployment. In addition, they have showed to be able to maintain a certain amount anticyclic behavior in order to survive on financial crisis. But to improve their opportunity of succeeding, they still need to implement strategies to favor their competitiveness. Our results show that effort has to be placed mainly in concentration but keeping in mind that It is important for members to learn how to handle problems and potential clashes using the right practices. It should be noted that CLUN operates as a first-degree cooperative since January of 2019. This suggests that these corporate restructuring processes seem to be very active in Galicia, which highlights the convenience of monitoring them. Further initiatives int this respect might raise the level of consciousness towards the importance of societal dimension to sharpen the competitiveness of companies working in this field. © 2012 Universitat de València.",Domínguez M.B.; Blanco A.O.; Márquez M.C.,Strategic,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.96.12915,Business concentration; CLUN; Cooperatives; Dairy sector; Galicia; Merger; Social economy,5.0,,10,5,CIRIEC,"The abstract discusses long-term goals and the strategic consolidation of cooperatives to enhance competitiveness in the dairy sector, which aligns with the definition of strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,CLUN: A business-case of concentration by merger of three dairy cooperatives at Galicians agrarian cooperatives; [CLUN: Concentración por fusión de tres cooperativas lácteas en el cooperativismo agrario en Galicia],2019
"Indentured to trends emerging worldwide in business-enterprise organization, this article relays the transformation that ensued from the process of building a system dynamics (SD) model, intended to provide decision-support for a firm competing in high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) industry. The SD modeling process helped the client firm see a considerable increase in its daily revenue, with a potential increase in accounting profit of 62 percent per day.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how headquarters’ managers perceive – cultural, administrative, geographic and economic (CAGE) – distance between countries and its influence on the strategy of international subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the transaction cost and behavioural theory and presents an exploratory and qualitative methodology approach through six semi-structured in-depth interviews to evaluate managers’ perceptions of distance between countries. Findings: The research findings show that cultural and economic distances indeed have a major influence on subsidiary strategy and a smaller impact of administrative and geographic dimensions, which results into forced changes on the marketing-mix, i.e. product, price, design and brand, as well as on the level of autonomy granted to foreign subsidiaries. Research limitations/implications: The limitation is related to the home country and the entry mode of foreign direct investment. The findings presented here reflect the nature and behaviour of Portuguese companies with subsidiaries. Practical implications: The research provides recommendations for managers to be aware of the influence of more than one dimension of distance between countries to improve their decision-making of standardisation-adaptation strategy for foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, the study stresses that managers’ perceptions may lead to the conclusion that proximity and knowledge of foreign markets does not make international business easier. Originality/value: This empirical research not only tests the transaction cost theory and behavioural theory on managers’ decisions to invest abroad but also promotes organisational changes to achieve the suitable strategy for international subsidiaries. The study contributes to the area of international business by positing six research propositions concerning distance between countries to be tested in future studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Antunes I.C.M.; Barandas H.G.; Martins F.V.,Strategic,10.1108/RIBS-01-2019-0007,Case study; Cultural administrative geographic economic distances; Foreign markets; Managers’ perceptions; Subsidiary strategy,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the influence of various distances (cultural, administrative, geographic, and economic) on the strategy of international subsidiaries, which pertains to long-term planning and decision-making for organizational goals.

"Objective: This study investigates the antecedents of three Brazilian franchisors’ internationalization processes in relation to their international marketing strategies. The literature review discusses the theme focusing on adaptation versus standardization of the marketing strategy. Method: A theoretical model is proposed for the empirical investigation including the internal and external internationalization antecedents, the international marketing strategy, and the firm´s degree of internationalization. A qualitative, exploratory, empirical investigation based on a multiple-case study was conducted with three large Brazilian franchisors in the fashion industry. Relevance: The study highlights the relevance of international branding for the internationalization process as well as the role partners/franchisees play in building and managing brand image abroad. Results: The results show that the most important antecedents in the franchisors’ internationalization process were at the firm level (company size, resources, and capabilities; brand strength; international orientation, and experience), with special emphasis on the brand as a crucial asset. The international marketing strategies were to both adapt the marketing elements to the needs and characteristics of the host market and centralize strategic decisions to maintain a consistent brand image. This posture follows the semi-global marketing strategy. Theoretical contribution: This study contributes to the knowledge about the factors that influence the decision to internationalize and the international marketing strategies used by Brazilian franchisors abroad.

"Tourists' travel decisions can be influenced by appropriate policies that seek to encourage them to choose travel plans leading to more sustainable tourism practices. Based on using conventional cognitive decision-making models, most current policy recommendations employ market-based economic incentives (e.g. taxes). This paper employs a dual emotional-cognitive decision-making model to represent tourists' choices. This framework allows comparing the efficacy of taxing emission levels against non-market sustainability policies including: (1) environmental information labelling; (2) emotional communication messages, and (3) limiting time pressure marketing practices. A field experiment (N = 509) was used to test the effectiveness of both market- and non-market-based sustainability policies in reducing overall CO2 emission levels by affecting destination choice. It found that the sensitivity of the choice decision to price is overestimated if and when emotions are not considered in the choice context. Tourists' decisions can not only be guided by rational financial calculations but also by the interplay of their emotions or the “animal spirits” cited by John Maynard Keynes. Therefore, effective policies to change behaviour towards more sustainable practices in tourism can be induced by working through non-market interventions like shaping positive emotional messages (but avoiding negative ones) and limiting time pressure marketing techniques. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Araña J.E.; León C.J.,Strategic,10.1080/09669582.2015.1101128,behavioural change; CO<sup>2</sup> emissions; emotive marketing; Field experiments; sustainable tourism; tourist choice,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of tourism policies aimed at promoting sustainable practices, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making processes.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Are tourists animal spirits?

"As market researchers, we have spent the past 30-plus years addressing the questions that impact the success of organizations in the service and non-profit sectors. It should come as no surprise, then, that when we bring our business lens and thought processes to the field of Jewish community studies, we also bring methods, approaches, and outcomes that differ markedly from traditional studies. Even more important than our methods, however, is the marketing framework in which we position our Jewish community studies. As a result of our marketing mindset, we look at the issues Jewish communities wish to address, analyze the data, and then draw conclusions and recommendations based on our deep experience understanding buyer behavior, purchase decision-making, and the customer experience. With this article, we hope to shed light on a different way of thinking about Jewish community studies, stimulate healthy discussion about the relative merits of all approaches to the subject, and contribute to the strengthening of Jewish communities everywhere. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Levine S.J.; Dranoff S.,Strategic,10.1007/s12397-016-9185-2,Business; Consumer behavior; Jewish community study; Market research; Marketing; Strategy; Survey,5.0,,5,0,Springer Netherlands,The abstract discusses a long-term approach to understanding Jewish community studies through a marketing framework that aims to address broader organizational goals and community strengthening.,scopus-recommendation,70,20,Jewish Community Studies as Seen Through a Business Lens,2016

"Purpose – Social media continues to be the major influencer in the lives of the millennial and generation-z in many regions of the world; especially in influencing their travel decisions. In order to validate such relationship, a systematic literature review with an end goal of closing the current gaps in knowledge with regard to the impact of social media on tourism in the Asia-Pacific region has been conducted. Design/Methodology – We performed a systematic search of relevant literature through various databases including Scopus, ScienceDirect and ProQuest. In total, 25 articles were taken into consideration in which the review protocol made use of specific techniques such as PRISMA. Approach – We conceptualized the differences and similarities in the Asia-Pacific tourism industry influenced by social media. Findings – As a contribution to knowledge and practice, we found that the usage of social media for tourism marketing purposes is strongly correlated to the tourism industry in many countries of the APAC region. However, it has not yet been generalized as a popular tool in other nations in the region. Originality of the research – This study provides practical and future recommendations concerning the influence of social media in the Asia-Pacific context that has become increasingly popular.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the dilemma that is based on a decision to disclose or not to disclose social shopping rewards (SSRs), in an effort to enhance the effectiveness of social shopping. To protect consumers and guide marketers, emergent forms of online commerce on social media platforms warrant closer examination. One such form is social shopping, which combines social media and online shopping. To motivate word of mouth (WOM) through social signs of approval or endorsement of brands, marketers have typically relied on social shopping rewards (SSRs). It is not typical, however, for the reason behind the social endorsement to be disclosed, leaving the branded message open to multiple interpretations. Design/methodology/approach – The dilemma of SSR disclosures is presented in a marketing and public policy analysis, drawing from findings from theWOMliterature on disclosure, incentives, source credibility and on social media Disclosure Guidelines by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA). Based on this analysis and on an extension of the Dual Credibility Model, a conceptual model is proposed that shows how disclosure works through source credibility to produce positive social shopping outcomes. Findings – In addition to the conceptual model, recommendations are made for marketing research, practice and public policy. Of significance are proposed SSR Disclosure Guidelines that extend FTC and WOMMA guidelines for best practices in disclosures in social media. Originality/value – This paper represents pioneering research on the disclosure of SSRs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Coker K.K.; Smith D.S.; Altobello S.A.,Strategic,10.1108/JRIM-06-2014-0030,Marketing communications; Marketing ethics; Online consumer behavior; Retailing online; Social media marketing; Word-of-mouth marketing,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the implications of disclosing social shopping rewards (SSRs) on consumer behavior and marketing effectiveness.

"Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case concerns the pricing decision of a service firm, and the use of the appropriate economic model to analyze that decision. A comparison of price-elasticity and cross-elasticity of demand highlights the market structure in which the firm operates and thereby an understanding of how a price change will impact the firm's total profit. Secondary issues involve classifying the cost of the firm's business activities and allocating those costs by sales revenue. The case has a difficulty level of three and is intended for use in junior-level courses. It can be covered in three hours, including a class presentation by a student team. The case requires a minimum of nine hours of outside preparation by students. This case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course. The purpose of the course is to enable students to apply the knowledge they have gained in their lower-division, business core courses that include microeconomics, financial accounting, and managerial accounting. Specifically, the case incorporates the understanding of profit-maximizing pricing under monopoly and duopoly models of competition, how price and cross-elasticity of demand are interpreted, and how cost data can be organized for management decisions. Case Synopsis: Students view the case through Susan, a recent business graduate, who has struggled to find employment and lives with her parents. Susan is anxious to turn her paid internship into a job. She interns for a local, Internet service provider, Speedy DSL. Speedy has a profit margin that is below the industry average and faces strong competition from Timely Cable in the local broadband market. Currently, the two firms (Speedy and Timely) charge the same price for basic Internet connectivity that is similar in speed and reliability. Another Speedy intern, Matt, uses an estimated monopoly demand schedule and Speedy's own cost data to argue that Speedy should raise its price. Speedy's Marketing Director asks Susan for an evaluation of Matt's proposal. Susan has read industry reports with an estimate of the cross-elasticity of demand between DSL price and Cable subscriptions. Understanding that Timely's gain of customers would be Speedy's loss; students (placed into Susan's position) evaluate the impact of a price increase on Speedy's profit in a duopoly setting. Students must also categorize the cost of Speedy's business activities and show the breakdown of those costs against sales revenue. Instructor's Notes: Recommendation for Teaching: Approaches This case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course. The purpose of the course is to enable students to apply knowledge they have gained in the lower-division business core. In addition, the course aims to improve students' communication and teamwork skills. Student teams evaluate the issues presented in the case, perform the appropriate analysis, and recommend a course of action. All teams submit a formal, written business report containing their analysis and recommendations. One team of students formally presents their case analysis to the class. A second team of students acts as a ""discussion team"" by asking the presenting team for further explanation or clarification of their recommendations. Following the discussion team's exchange with the presenters, the entire class is welcome to participate in an active question and answer session.

"Purpose: This paper seeks to explore how Indian buying firms practise an open book (OB) policy in supplier relationships in three industries, i.e. the vehicle industry, the construction industry and the information technology industry. It also aims to study determinants of open book practices. Design/methodology/approach: Application of the OB policy is operationalised as the nature of open book practices, the extent and stage of data disclosed, the form of data disclosed, the direction of data disclosed, the attitude towards cost data disclosed, and the purpose and conditions of data disclosed. Determinants of the open book policy comprise characteristics of the exchange, the product, the buyer, the supplier and the supply market. Qualitative data were collected in the form of 22 interviews with representatives of three buying organisations and several of their suppliers in order to build three case studies. Findings: The results suggest that the OB policy is used by buyers for diverse purposes ranging from strategic to operational, for example value engineering at the product development stage, to ensure supplier margins, for self improvements and cost reductions, and country entry decisions. Similarly, the data shared ranged from narrow to wide in scope and scale. Suppliers' attitudes ranged from fairly neutral to very negative towards open books. Power asymmetries, the number of alternative suppliers, product performance characteristics and value, incentives offered, and buyer efforts were found to influence OB practices. Practical implications: Experiences gained from employing an OB policy in vehicle manufacturing suggests that firms in other industries can better leverage the use of open books for joint problem solving, equitable profit sharing and supplier selection. Originality/value: The paper highlights that an OB policy can have broader applicability than recognised by many past studies and indicates that it can serve purposes of strategic decision-making. It can also be an integrated part of a buyer's risk reduction strategy. Further, the study provides specific recommendations for Indian companies with regard to the application of an open book policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Kumra R.; Agndal H.; Nilsson U.,Strategic,10.1108/08858621211207225,Buyer-seller relationships; Buyer-supplier relationships; Buyers; India; Open book policy; Relationship marketing,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses an open book policy in supplier relationships, which is related to strategic decision-making in the context of organizational goals and long-term relationships.

"Recent literature discusses movies and television as determinants of destinations’ image formation influencing tourists’ travel decisions. However, there still exists a lack of knowledge regarding the details of such screen-related influences on travel behaviour. This study attempts to shed light on these screen-related aspects and their role in influencing travel decisions and travel behaviour at the destination. In particular, it examines the role of the AustroGerman Sissi movies in attracting visitors to Vienna (Austria). The movies were shot during the 1950s and Vienna served as a major set for the movie. Based on a review of the major literature in the field of movie-induced tourism and the empirical survey the authors are able to derive implications for destination marketing and further research recommendations. Questionnaires were distributed amongst visitors of Sissi-related heritage sites. The findings support the importance of movie-induced tourism by illustrating that the Sissi movies contributed to travellers’ choice to visit Vienna and the film location. © 2011 Tourism Recreation Research.",Peters M.; Schuckert M.; Chon K.; Schatzmann C.,Strategic,10.1080/02508281.2011.11081317,Destination images; Movie-induced tourism; Sissi; Travel decisions,10.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The study addresses the long-term impacts of movies on destination marketing and travel decisions, suggesting broader implications for tourism strategy and marketing goals.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Empire and romance: Movie-induced tourism and the case of the sissi movies,2011
"Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a ""professional board"" of directors.

These units are mostly located within the marketing or market research or corporate planning department and has been established from 5 to 9 years. On average, 2 to 5 full-time personnel are assigned to take charge of CI activities. The top three sources managers acquire CI are newspapers and periodicals, the Internet and extranets, and customers. Whereas, the top three sources where CI is used in strategic decision making are customers, competitors, and newspapers and periodicals. In terms of source category, while the frequency of acquiring CI is higher from external impersonal sources, the frequency of using external and personal sources in strategic decision making is significantly higher than internal and impersonal sources.

"When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms' solutions and those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation, and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management approaches, and constraints.

"The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of a category management tool known as Category Optimizer™ at Foster's Wine Estates Americas for one of its brands, the Beringer California Collection. Foster's was facing a common management problem: harnessing its portfolio of Beringer California Collection wines to increase profitability, improve its competitive position, and defend against a disruptive new entrant in the U.S. wine market called Yellow Tail. Category Optimizer combines the parsimony of an internal market structure with the advances that have been made in assortment planning in operations research, assortment and stock-keeping-unit-level modeling, mixed logits, and the marketing literature on the perceptions of variety of assortment to develop and estimate a model on readily available store scanner data. The model subsequently uses these results to inform strategic and tactical decision making. This approach led to recommendations that initially seemed counterintuitive; the normal response would be for Foster's to consider lowering prices to maintain share and volume, a strategy not inconsistent with many of the recommendations of past models. However, considering the additional degrees of freedom that a product range offered for defense, we demonstrated that a combination of price increases together with the introduction of a volume-flanker product in a new channel would improve profits, increase revenue, and protect and enhance market share. These were successfully implemented in early 2008, earning rich dividends for the company; increasing profitability by 70%, revenue by 3%, and earnings before interest and taxes by 8.5%; and having a positive impact on its brand ranking. In fact, in 2008, it debuted as sixth among the international wine brands. It also managed to play an important role in deposing Yellow Tail, the market share leader, from its dominant position. We conclude the paper by providing examples of other companies where this approach has also been successfully implemented and by discussing some avenues for future research. ©2013 INFORMS.",Sinha A.; Sahgal A.; Mathur S.K.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1120.0746,Assortment; Brand portfolio; Category management; Disruptive innovations; Internal market structure; Perception of variety,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The paper discusses the implementation of a category management tool aimed at long-term goals such as increasing profitability, improving competitive position, and defending against market entrants.

"Governments spend considerable public resources, including tax dollars, on marketing their cities or countries in order to become a strong brand attractive for exports, foreign direct investment and tourism. Ironically at the same time, self-imposed and strict visa regulations that can potentially hamper the productivity of marketing and branding are fairly common. There are valid reasons for imposing strict visa regulations, two of the most important being national and economic security. Although strict visa regulations are a common phenomenon around the world, the tourism academia have yet to argue against strict visa regulations by providing empirical evidence on their potential impact on tourism demand, and hence the economy. The current study is a pioneer attempt to generate awareness about the potential detrimental impacts of visa restrictions on a country's economy, by using the case of People's Republic of China, one of the countries known to have a history of strict visa regulations. The research reported in this paper was based on the standard tourism demand function, which models the causal relationship between tourism demand and a number of macroeconomic variables. The autoregressive distributed lag model (ADLM) was used since it has a dynamic specification that takes the time path of the tourist decision-making process into consideration by using both current and lagged values of variables. Results show the negative effect of visa regulations on both country-level and prefecture-level economies.

"Purpose: Marketers devote great efforts to maintaining brand value. However, brand value can come under attack in the absence of sufficient product performance and image differentiation in a process called unbranding. This paper aims to provide insights and guidelines that will give marketing managers tools to deal with variables that impact consumer decisions on whether to buy a national brand or a store brand product. Design/methodology/approach: A consumer research study was based on a random, mall intercept with 188 respondents consisting of seven questions scored on a ten-point scale. The results are presented on a set of graphs accompanied with some analysis of means (ANOM) applications. Findings: Results indicated that a significant portion of consumers (from over 40 percent to a high of 85 percent) feel that the quality differences between branded and generic products have diminished and the price premiums charged by branded products are often no longer justifiable. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study imply that in branded product premium image must be maintained and enhanced, otherwise it will be lost. In addition, the trend of brand value loss referred to as unbranding will vary significantly by and within a product category. Practical implications: Branded products must maintain their superior consumer perception and product performance. Store or generic brand marketers should exploit the favorable price-value relationship gained because of the loss of brand value through a process of store branding. Originality/value: The new concept of unbranding is introduced together with research-based recommendations for brand value protection strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Mayer P.; Vambery R.G.,Strategic,10.1108/07363761311304951,Brand identity; Brand values; Differentiation; Generics; Price-to-value; Store brands; Unbranding,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of brand value and introduces the concept of unbranding, which relates to strategic brand management and positioning in the marketplace.

The aim of this article is to inspire multidisciplinary research on the mechanisms and consequences of social embeddedness on decision making and to highlight opportunities and challenges by synthesizing findings from various fields, such as IS research, sociology, economics, marketing and other management disciplines.

"A study is reported that investigates the goals underlying undergraduate students' engagement in their major classes, nonmajor classes, and in extracurricular activities. The qualitative study employs both focus groups and goal-mapping exercises. The results suggest that students tend to focus on utilitarian, attribute-level considerations mainly related to credentialing for purposes of employment. The results are considered from the perspectives of judgment and decision making, learning models, and the emerging service marketing perspective. These model considerations underscore an argument for moving toward models of education delivery focusing on value co-creation instead of the current emphasis on providing value to students. A series of recommendations are offered to help facilitate faculty efforts to increase course engagement, particularly in large-section course offerings. However, the authors ultimately conclude that student engagement with their course-related experiences will best be served in models of value co-creation by a focus on more than intellectual maturity in education. Specifically, an argument is presented for also targeting moral and motivational maturity.

"Subject area: The area of focus is on internationalization strategies, specifically on developing suitable strategies to support an internationalization initiative of a new medical device company. Study level/applicability: This case is designed for final year undergraduate and MBA students. It is suitable for courses of organizational management, organization theory and design, strategic management, and international business as well as international marketing. Case overview: GranuLab, a medical device company that produced the synthetic bone graft substitute GranuMaS, aspired to be a high-growth company. To achieve this aspiration the company had made plans for internationalization, which include penetrating the ASEAN, Middle East, Latin American, and African markets within the next five years. By December 2010, GranuLab had completed the construction of its new manufacturing facility in Shah Alam, about 30km from Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur. This manufacturing facility had the capability to produce high volumes to support the company's high growth plan. However, the company's internationalization processes had taken longer than expected and this has led to a low business volume. By mid-2012, the company was forced to make a quick decision as it had suffered a year and a half of operations losses. GranuLab had to formulate a strategy as to how to position GranuMaS and penetrate the targeted markets. Failure to internationalize would incur even greater losses and might hinder the achievement of its high growth aspiration by 2015. Expected learning outcomes: This case is designed to stimulate case analysts' thinking into providing recommendations for the appropriate internationalization strategies to be adopted by the management team to ensure that the company could succeed in achieving its goals. The case will expose students to the concepts and theories of strategic management, international business, international entrepreneurship; and facilitate the development of students' abilities to apply those concepts in managerial situations.

"Although the new middle classes in emerging markets are a matter of significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, there has been little systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological sensibilities informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these sensibilities are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class sensibilities, which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These sensibilities crystallize into a particular mode of consumption - ""formulaic creativity"" - which addresses consumers' desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies.

"Marketing experience is a new area, yet little examined marketing theorists and practitioners. However, the recent period has increasingly focused on the concept of experience marketing and its practical application. Many service companies recognize that business success depends on the user experience development and management, because satisfied customers are likely to repeat purchases and verbal recommendations. The paper aims to theoretically reason the possibilities of applying experience marketing in the sector of hospitality services. In order to reveal the conceptualization of experience marketing in the hospitality services sector, was made extensive theoretical studies of experience/experiential marketing and hospitality sector. This article presents the theoretical model of experience marketing in the hospitality services sector, which consists of two structural components: 1. reflects the client/guest experience levels and types as well as the activities of company; 2. the customer/guest behavioural consequences (results), which depends on what kind of experience customers receives. Model specification and theoretical analysis of the study showed that the hospitality service companies should use the experience marketing tools, because the main task of companies providing hospitality services is to make a customer become a steady visitor/customer, since his/her decisions and actions will depend in the future on his/her ""positive"", ""unforgettable"", ""unique"" experience while facing with service provider or brand.",Verbauskiene L.; Griesiene I.,Strategic,,Experience; Experience marketing; Experiential marketing; Sector of hospitality,5.0,,10,5,Vilnius University,"The abstract discusses the theoretical framework of experience marketing in the hospitality sector, emphasizing the long-term implications of customer experience on business success, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Conceptualization of experience marketing in the sector of hospitality services,2014
"Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover, the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Yao S.; Mela C.F.; Chiang J.; Chen Y.,Strategic,10.1509/jmr.11.0009,Discount rate; Dynamic structural model; Forward-looking consumers; Identification; Pricing; Three-part tariff,5.0,,10,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses a method for identifying discount rates based on utility/profit calculations in dynamic pricing scenarios.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to bring forth the limitations of some important models of cognition and behavior adopted by social marketers and present important findings from recent lines of research that contribute to a fine-grained understanding of human behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that presents a review of several theoretical approaches to human cognition and behavior and their implications regarding social marketing campaigns. Findings: It is concluded that the assumptions underlying traditional models of behavior need to be revised, especially the assumption that human beings are rational decision makers - the prototypical homo economicus. Behavioral science has revealed that people are far from being rational and are prone to be influenced by myriad factors, some deemed irrelevant under rational models. Social marketing interventions have greater probability of success when they rely on more realistic assumptions of human behavior. Research limitations/implications: Social marketing needs to embrace the contributions of the several disciplines and lines of research centered on the study of all facets of human behavior, such as behavioral economics and dual-system framework. Practical implications: The main implications are: the recommendation to assume people are running on their System 1 when they are in contact with social marketing campaigns, the need to consider the interplay of systems and selves over time, the recommended emphasis on place strategies, and the need to avoid cash incentives and silver bullets. Originality/value: The value of this paper is in contrasting the assumptions of traditional models of cognition and behavior widely used in social marketing with the evidence from several lines of research portraying influences in human behavior not accounted by those models. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Carvalho H.C.; Mazzon J.A.,Strategic,10.1108/JSOCM-11-2011-0080,Cognition; Consumer attitudes; Consumer behaviour; Social marketing; Social marketing theory; Theory of planned behaviour,10.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the need to revise traditional models of cognition and behavior in social marketing, emphasizing a long-term understanding of human behavior and its implications for social marketing campaigns.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Homo economicus and social marketing: Questioning traditional models of behavior,2013
"Market orientation can be defined as the company’s ability to systematically generate relevant information about current and latent customer needs, spread this information across all company departments and use this information in decision making and subsequent behavior. Current research proves that market orientation correlates strongly with profitability. Strengthening market orientation should therefore be the main focus of the marketing department. However, over the last years, marketers within companies have faced serious criticism coming from the top management as well as from other business functions. This criticism stems from the generally shared opinion that marketing expenditures tend to rise whereas marketing effectiveness and efficiency seem to decline over time, as proved by relatively low satisfaction and loyalty levels of customers and their resistance towards marketing activities. This study investigates the main barriers of marketing effectiveness and efficiency within companies. Based on two focus groups with senior Czech marketing managers we revealed several key themes that reflect how local marketers perceive their jobs. We identified that marketing departments differ diametrically in activities they execute, that marketers face image problem within their companies and that they are not able to prove return of their activities sufficiently. Furthermore, we individuated barriers specific for our context not found in the literature. However, companies of different size and sectors have specifics which are discussed in the text. Managerial recommendations are added. All of these findings should be of high importance for both CEOs (resp. owners) and marketers, because increasing effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing function is their common goal. ©, 2014, Technical University of Liberec.

Despite debates over whether or not marketing principles should be used to promote socially beneficial behaviors, the field has become successful at utilizing such practices to achieve its goals. However, even with these advancements, social marketing research has yet to fully consider how the use of traditional marketing practices in socially oriented settings can alter the way stakeholders perceive and interact with the organizations employing these tactics.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to establish and identify the target market of a proposed residential development in Gaborone using the STP strategy. Research design/methodology/approach - Both non-probability and probability sampling techniques were used by applying qualitative and quantitative research methods (interviews and questionnaire) were used to get research data in order to meet the objective of the study. A survey instrument using a self-administered questionnaire was developed and administered to the respondents who were working earning a monthly salary was used in order to meet the minimum qualifying criteria for a home loan being 30% of one's income to service mortgage payments. Significance - The study is relevant to developers who just develop/invest scarce resources without establishing the need/demand for the product. It will be a lesson learnt for those developers who shun/disregard the input of market research in the process of decision making for housing property development. Findings - The study established that this was the first research of its kind within the housing market. It also revealed that target market identification is critical in market research because it help the developer to minimise the unsystematic and systematic risks which might affect the success of the development project thereby impacting on the profitability of the business. It will also help them appreciate by positioning the product in the minds of the target market through offering the product with features that the customers are looking for. From the developer's point of view, they will be fulfilling the customer's needs by implementing the recommendations and results of the market research report. Once these needs are met and fulfilled, the property listing period is also reduced at the time of marketing the property and customers are identified even before the propduct is developed thus adding value to the business.

"Title: Shavteli Winery: where to go from here? Subject area: International marketing, national competitiveness, strategic decision‐making, wine. Study level/applicability: Undergraduate and MBA. Case overview: The nationally important Georgian wine industry by 2008 was in a deep recession due largely to the continuing 2006 Russian wine embargo, prior to which Russia had been the largest export market for Georgian wines. Second World War‐era Georgian wineries such as Shavteli (disguised), in the historic Racha‐Lechkumi wine‐producing region, were disadvantaged due to aging facilities, lack of tourist infrastructure, and inadequate capital to make needed changes to compete in the global markets for emerging economy wines. All nearby wineries faced continuing operating deficits, high inventory levels, and could lose much of their aging wine inventory to oxidation if they could not quickly sell more wine or convert the wine to brandy. To avert becoming another defunct producer, Shavteli needed a strategy. Industry observers were divided about whether Shavteli and its sister Georgian wineries should continue operating independently, seek government support, or form a marketing association to create new export demand. Students need to prepare a strategic plan for Shavteli and the Georgian wine industry. Expected learning outcomes: Students should develop well‐supported recommendations for competitive strategies in an emerging economy. Students should use strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and country competitiveness analyses to ascertain vision and mission, segmentation, targeting, positioning, and alliance strategies for international markets.

"Issues of segmentation and positioning have always been at the heart of marketing management. In recent years, much methodological progress has been made in order to carry out these two tasks simultaneously, that is, to combine certain types of clustering algorithms with appropriate multidimensional scaling or unfolding procedures. When trying to provide managers with a tool to support marketing decision-making in segmentation and positioning, the ease of use and the visual quality of results must be emphasized. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of alternative graphical formats designed to assist strategic management. It focuses on three aspects, namely, (I) representing competitive market structures, (II) illustrating preferences for product attributes, and (III) describing customer heterogeneity at the individual as well as segment-specific levels; this paper also explores the interrelations among these aspects. The benefits and limitations of different approaches are discussed, and graphical examples are provided.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between perceived brand orientation (PBO), satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour in the Australian higher education sector. Design/methodology/approach – Two hundred and fifty-eight questionnaires were completed by undergraduate students of a particular university in Australia. Structural equation modeling was employed in this study to examine the associations between the constructs. Findings – This study provides empirical evidence that PBO has a positive and significant relationship with all dependent variables. The research reveals that students' perception of a university's brand orientation is significantly related to satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour. Research limitations/implications – The findings may guide the key decision makers in higher education institutions to understand the importance of brand orientation in their corporate strategy to enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and positive WOM, which can be used to differentiate themselves from other institutions in the highly competitive education market. Originality/value – Past researchers have not looked into the dynamic relationships between PBO, satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour, and hence research is to be called for in this area.

However, student satisfaction is not the only factor at play. Using a framework of 'push and pull' factors, rooted in the international student choice literature, this exploratory study investigates the determinants of destination choice of international students who decided to study at a university in the UK and examines their attitudes toward international branch campuses. The survey results and analyses suggest that overseas campuses could pose a considerable threat to home campuses in the competition for international students in the future. ©2011 Taylor & Francis.",Wilkins S.; Huisman J.,Strategic,10.1080/08841241.2011.573592,Competition; Higher education marketing; International branch campuses; Student choice; Student recruitment,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the long-term influences on international student choices and satisfaction, which relate to strategic goals for universities competing for international students.

"There is mounting evidence that current food production, transport, land use and urban design negatively impact both climate change and obesity outcomes. Recommendations to prevent climate change provide an opportunity to improve environmental outcomes and alter our food and physical activity environments in favour of a 'healthier' energy balance. Hence, setting goals to achieve a more sustainable society offers a unique opportunity to reduce levels of obesity. In the case of children, this approach is supported with evidence that even from a young age they show emerging understandings of complex environmental issues and are capable of both internalizing positive environmental values and influencing their own environmental outcomes. Given young children's high levels of environmental awareness, it is easy to see how environmental sustainability messages may help educate and motivate children to make 'healthier' choices. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a new approach to tackling childhood obesity by tapping into existing social movements, such as environmental sustainability, in order to increase children's motivation for healthy eating and physical activity behaviours and thus foster more wholesome communities. We contend that a social marketing framework may be a particularly useful tool to foster behaviour change beneficial to both personal and environmental health by increasing perceived benefits and reducing perceived costs of behaviour change. Consequently, we propose a new framework which highlights suggested pathways for helping children initiate and sustain 'healthier' behaviours in order to inform future research and potentially childhood obesity intervention strategies. © The Author (2013).",Skouteris H.; Cox R.; Huang T.; Rutherford L.; Edwards S.; Cutter-Mackenzie A.,Strategic,10.1093/heapro/dat007,Children; Environmental sustainability; Obesity prevention; Social marketing,5.0,,10,5,Oxford University Press,"The abstract discusses a long-term approach to addressing childhood obesity by integrating environmental sustainability into health behaviors, which aligns with strategic planning and goal-setting for societal change.",scopus-recommendation,70,10,Promoting obesity prevention together with environmental sustainability,2014
"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to systematically document, scrutinise and critically analyse the current research literature on higher education choice to: Establish the scope of the studies; map the factors associated with choice; identify the key strengths and weaknesses in the research literature; critically analyse the extant research and make recommendations for further research in this field.

"Recent literature about broadband telecommunications reveals two major areas that are not only globally gaining prominence, but are also demanding urgent attention from a research perspective. One of the key areas is related to the need to spatially evaluate the availability and deployment of broadband services, especially among urban versus rural communities. Another area of interest falls under the need for enabling broadband policies and strategies that address existing geographic disparities. These motivating factors shaped this research and provided a basis for defining three specific objectives, namely: (1) to identify locations with or without broadband access, (2) to identify underserved rural and inner-city markets, and (3) to determine whether university and community college towns can be used in the adoption and dispersion of broadband technologies in southern Illinois. Supply-side and demand-side data were collected and inputted into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Supply-side data included cable modem, digital subscriber lines (DSL), wireless, and fiber optic lines, while demand data included reported broadband requests from individuals without access (n = 439), students (n = 45,866), and higher education workforce (n = 5419). Using the GIS and statistical techniques, insightful maps of broadband infrastructure were created to illustrate areas of supply and demand so that governments and businesses can address existing gaps in consumer needs. Specifically, different levels of broadband access and use were mapped; different under-served rural and inner-city markets were identified so as to emphasize the dramatic economic impact on the business opportunities available to small business entrepreneurs. Also, different geographies of use and accessibility of broadband connectivity in the study region were synthesized to support decision-making. The resulting maps provided supply and demand marketing intelligence based on the geographic analyses of residential and enterprise sectors. These data can be used as a model to develop specific policy recommendations for a knowledge-based economy, specifically for the southern Illinois region or other rural communities in the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Oyana T.J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.giq.2010.09.003,Broadband; Digital divide; GIS; ICT; Spatial analysis,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract focuses on identifying and addressing geographic disparities in broadband access and formulating policies to improve broadband deployment, which aligns with long-term planning and goal setting.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,Exploring geographic disparities in broadband access and use in rural southern Illinois: Who's being left behind?,2011
"Assessing the value of marketing to a business remains a thorny issue in theory and practice. Decision-making at the finance-marketing interface is under-researched, particularly for project businesses. Confronted by demands of accountability concerning the allocation of resources to meet competitive pressures, the paper examines the quality and extent of dialogue in investment decision-making. The return on investment (ROI) and marketing-specific investment (ROMI) are important factors at the marketing-finance interface. ROMI/ROI is examined from quantitative and qualitative viewpoints. The empirical evidence shows that short-term financial criteria dominate and are misaligned to long-term performance of project businesses and business units. Marketing investment in relation to project markets poses a particularly challenging environment. Client lifetime value and programme data sets for ROMI coupled with qualitative decision-making offer ways forward with constructive dialogue at the finance-marketing interface.

"From the supplier firm's perspective, a referral is a recommendation from A (the referrer) to B (the potential customer) that B should, or should not, purchase from C (the supplier firm). Thus, as referrals are for a specific supplier firm, they should be viewed as part of the supplier firm's marketing and sales activities. We recognize three types of referrals - customer-to-potential customer referrals, horizontal referrals, and supplier-initiated referrals - that have critical roles in a potential customer's purchase decision.We develop the concept of referral equity to capture the net effect of all referrals for a supplier firm in the market. We argue that supplier firms should view referral equity as a resource that has financial value to the firm as it affects the firm's cash flows and profits. We offer strategies firms can use to manage referrals and build their referral equity and suggest a research agenda.

"There is currently much debate surrounding the housing systems for dairy cattle. Large farms, which represent a growing share of the dairy farms, prefer indoor housing systems whereas smaller farms concentrate on low-input systems by giving extended pasture access to milk cows.

"Purpose: Pharmaceutical companies' marketing strategies have traditionally targeted only physicians and, more recently, consumers. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the pharmacist as prescriber, influencer, switcher, and dispenser of pharmaceutical drugs in one developing country, Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: The authors surveyed pharmacists in Cairo, Egypt. The pharmacists were asked to estimate the percentages of patients who came in with a prescription, with only a box or a recommendation for a medicine and with only symptoms, and whether he/she switched the patient to another medicine. Pharmacies were classified as to the social class of the pharmacy neighborhoods. Cluster analysis was used to further classify pharmacists as ""Influencers"" and ""Non-influencers"". Findings: Overall the pharmacists influence 39 percent of all purchase decisions for pharmaceuticals with higher levels of influence in lower social class neighborhoods. Approximately one out of four pharmacists was classified as an Influencer. Practical implications: In developing countries, the pharmacist plays a key role in which medicines patients ultimately purchase. Marketing activities directed toward the pharmacist may provide an important opportunity to maximize the pharmaceutical firms' return on marketing investment. Originality/value: Few studies have looked at the marketing of pharmaceutical drugs in developing countries. This paper is unique in that it examines the role of the pharmacist in these markets, thus providing an important addition to the understanding of the challenges to the industry in these countries and important implications for pharmaceutical marketing strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Taher A.; Stuart E.W.; Hegazy I.,Strategic,10.1108/17506121211243068,Developing countries; Egypt; Expert power; Influence; Marketing strategy; Pharmaceutical marketing; Pharmaceutical products; Pharmacists,5.0,,10,5,,"The paper explores the role of pharmacists in pharmaceutical marketing strategies in a developing country, indicating long-term implications for the industry and marketing efforts.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,The pharmacist's role in the Egyptian pharmaceutical market,2012

"Purpose This research is a qualitative study which aims to investigate the intricacies of organisational buying behaviour in the context of the Irish biotechnology industry. Particularly the research seeks to focus on the phenomenon of buying centres as the core decision-making unit in an organisation and examines the functionality of such a process. The main aims of the research study is to examine key influencers, as well as to examine the decision process itself so as to fully comprehend modern organisational buyer behaviour and to discuss these issues from a practical viewpoint beneficial to both the marketing and purchasing functions. Design/methodology/approach The research process was conducted through qualitative methods, which formed a combination of focus group and key respondent interviewing. A triangular approach of data was also used to obtain quality information and to achieve a platform upon which to base accurate conclusions. A small number of organisations from industry participated in this study, which was deemed sufficient as the purpose of the study was gaining insight as opposed to proving or disproving previous theories. Findings It was discovered that users were key influencers in the decision process as were quality control personnel. In addition the business functions were found to be the decision makers in a highly dynamic buying centre process, which is constantly changing in terms of numbers, participation, and structure. Based on the finding of the research newer models of organisation buying behaviour were developed in addition to appropriate marketing strategies being put forward in order to better represent the realities of modern business-to-business marketing. This is where the real benefits of this research will be seen as marketing organisations become more efficient, buying organisations develop best practice procedures, and academics can build on this research base to further enhance marketing knowledge.

"This paper examines a tendency within existing marketing scholarship to compartmentalize ethical issues. It also shows how this tendency can cause ethical tensions and conflicts in marketing practice. The emerging service-dominant (S-D) logic for marketing, as proposed by Vargo and Lusch, is explored as an example of an approach to marketing that overcomes this tendency. The S-D logic is found to be a positive development for marketing ethics because it facilitates the seamless integration of ethical accountability into marketing decision-making.

"Procter & Gamble (P&G) Asia-Pacific is interested in managing value growth. Only after fully understanding the true effects of the marketing-mix variables can P&G managers make strategic decisions answering questions such as the following: (1) Are the P&G brands in the detergent market inelastic or elastic with respect to price? How has the price elasticity changed over time? Can P&G increase the price of its brands to gain value growth? (2) What are the price, distribution, and sizing combinations needed to achieve the desirable value growth? (3) How can P&G gain market share from its competitors without cannibalizing its own brands? P&G Asia-Pacific approached us to develop a value growth framework to answer these questions. To generate the answers for the above questions, we develop a three-step weighted random coefficient estimator that captures the heterogeneity across cross sections (different stock-keeping units and states) and the endogeneity of distribution. Based on the parameter estimates, we provide strategic recommendations to P&G for a field test to validate our suggestions. We developed a simulator for P&G managers so that they can generate appropriate marketing-mix strategies for achieving the desired value growth. As a result, P&G gained over $39 million in value growth over a one-year period by implementing the recommendations from our modeling approach. © 2009 INFORMS.",Kumar V.; Fan J.; Gulati R.; Venkat P.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1080.0477,Distribution; Marketing mix; Price elasticity; Random coefficient model; Revenue; Sales value; Sales volume; System of equations,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to value growth and strategic decisions based on the marketing-mix variables, which aligns with defining the goals and nature of the organization.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,Marketing-mix recommendations to manage value growth at P&G Asia-Pacific,2009
"Purpose - The paper seeks to discuss and analyse the nature of place umbrella brands and the role such brands play in promotion of a country, a region, or a city. The purpose is also to identify some salient success criteria of provenance associations as core values of place umbrella brands. Design/methodology/approach - The study delineates a conceptual framework, which illustrates important components in place umbrella branding. It also highlights a set of criteria to aid prioritisations among prospective provenance associations that have a potential to be used as brand values of place umbrella brands. Practical implications - The paper identifies some characteristics of provenance associations, which make them more transferable across a bundle of umbrella brand partners. The generation of better marketing theory in the field of place branding will make it easier for practitioners to reach the right decisions in choice of provenance associations. Findings - It is claimed that transcendence is related to the transferability of provenance associations across a bundle of brands. Because transferability strongly depends on perceptions of similarity, the starting point is to identify matches between the partner brands based on their shared provenance. Originality/value - The article ends with a recommendation that researchers in place branding should carefully analyze provenance associations according to the suggested criteria. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Iversen N.M.; Hem L.E.,Strategic,10.1108/03090560810862534,Brand image; Brand management; Brands,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the nature of place umbrella brands and their role in promoting regions or countries, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic branding concepts.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent of use of the price-quality cue in financial services, and to uncover some of its drivers. The drives studied are: advertising exposure, product complexity, and consumer price knowledge. The use of price as an indicator of quality has been a well-documented phenomenon in consumer goods markets. However, the existence of this relationship has not been tested in services, and in particular in financial services markets. Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey of over 200 individuals contacted through intercept interviews was conducted. The use of the price-quality cue and its drivers were measured using multi-item scales, for six financial services categories: checking accounts, financial advisory services, automobile insurance, home insurance, life insurance, and tax accounting. Findings - Significant variations in the use of price as an indicator of quality across financial services categories are identified. Furthermore, it is found that both consumer price knowledge and advertising exposure increase the use of the price-quality cue, while product complexity was found to have no significant impact on price-quality cue utilization for financial services. Research limitations/implications - Future research could expand the array of variables which drive consumers' use of the price-quality cue. In addition, a wider range of financial services categories could be studied. Practical implications - Knowing the extent by which consumers depend on the price-quality cue in their decisions is critical to optimal positioning of a financial brand. This paper provides specific managerial recommendations on how to approach the pricing and marketing of each of the six financial services categories studied. In addition public policymakers may find the findings of interest due to quality perception biases that may result from financial services providers' pricing tactics Originality/value - While previous research studies in price-quality cue utilization have primarily focused on manufactured goods, this paper is the only study that has examined the dynamics of price-quality cue utilization by consumers in financial services. This is an important inquiry due to the large volume of consumer expenditures in financial services categories, and the significant impact that these categories have on the financial stability and well-being of the public.",Estelami H.,Strategic,10.1108/10610420810875115,Customer relations; Customer service management; Financial services; Pricing; Quality,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the use of the price-quality cue in financial services and its implications for marketing strategies, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making processes.",scopus-recommendation,50,30,Consumer use of the price-quality cue in financial services,2008
"County Community Bank (CCB), the largest community bank in the state of Mississippi, built its success in the regional business market through relationship marketing and a high-touch approach. However, by the mid-1990s, CCB management began to believe that its image as ""a small town bank"" would be detrimental to future success. To be better aligned with new national competition, an image change was undertaken whereby the bank shifted its competitive advantage to include the area of technology, eventually becoming one of the most technologically aggressive banks in the state, and even the region. Had CCB become too product-driven in its business-to-business marketing decisions, or were they still customer-driven? Had the changes resulted in the intended outcomes? Consequently, CCB commissioned a market research study in which current business customers were surveyed. The results of this study are presented.

"How should a retailer think about the decision to carry, price, and promote products that overlap with another store when such overlap is predicted to intensify price competition and drive down product prices? The existing research suggests that retailers should look to carry an ever-increasing percentage of unique or non-overlapping products [J. Marketing 61 (1997) 38; Marketing Sci. 19 (2000) 83], thereby eliminating the ability to compare prices across stores.We challenge this recommendation, arguing that overlapping products allow one type of retailer-the higher end retailer-to signal the fairness of its prices and foster a more favorable price image than might otherwise exist. In a laboratory study, we show that, for higher end stores, the existence of overlapping products can significantly increase perceptions of pricing fairness and subsequent store choice, even when those overlapping products are no cheaper in the focal store than in a competing store. © 2004 New York University.

"Purpose: The main purpose of this study is threefold: to analyze the current conditions of higher education services offered in the three target markets; to conduct market segmentation analysis of these markets; and to recommend the most appropriate market entry strategies for Hong Kong's education service providers. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this project were obtained primarily by questionnaire survey and interviews. The research team collected 1,370 questionnaires and conducted a total of 121 individual and focus group interviews in the four studied cities - Mumbai, New Delhi, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur. Findings: The study found that there was a high unmet demand for higher education overseas and that the visibility of Hong Kong's higher education was relatively weak in these Asian markets. In order to capture the continued rise of students in Asia, higher education institutions and the Hong Kong government need to work together to analyze the potential markets critically and employ marketing strategies sensibly. Several key recommendations have been provided based on the findings. Research limitations/implications: The study was undertaken in a few key cities in these three target markets. However, findings from the study may generate insights into other cities with similar characteristics in these countries and the Asian regions. Practical implications: The paper suggests that decision makers at the institutional level and government level seeking to enter these markets must pay attention to the importance of market segmentation and the 4P variables in formulating their marketing strategies.

Design/methodology/approach - The research design/methodology is based primarily on survey research on skill development in MBA programmes from the perspectives of both graduates and marketing practitioners. Findings - This research suggests that six important skill weaknesses - decision making, leadership, problem formulation, persuasion, creativity, and negotiation - need to be developed among future marketers and that a marketing education framework should be based on the pillars of a project and dissertation, classroom debate and discussion, and oral presentations. Research limitations/implications - Future research should focus on understanding and explaining to an even greater extent how marketing education can make more effective use of interactive, hands-on learning approaches typified by a project and dissertation, classroom debates and discussions, and oral presentations. Practical implications - Implications for practice include the suggestion that practitioners must also assume responsibility for developing initiatives that facilitate marketing skill development as well.

In a competitive environment, it becomes imperative not just to attract customers, but also to design strategies aimed at maintaining these customers. Drawing on data from over 2,000 retail bank customers in Ghana, this study aims at understanding the key motivations for maintaining accounts with banks in respect of Ghanaian bank customers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from customers of 22 retail banks in Ghana. A two-stage sampling technique was adopted in obtaining the sample. First, for each of the banks, two branches were randomly selected from the list of all functionally operating branches. In the second stage, customers of the selected branches were randomly intercepted in the banking halls and the survey instrument administered to them. A total of 2,000 respondents were attracted. Logistic regression modelling was employed in analysing the data. Findings: Overall bank customers view proximity/accessibility as the most important factor in the opening and maintenance of accounts with banks in Ghana. Recommendations by friends appear to be the least important factor in Ghanaian bank consumers' decision to open and maintain a bank account in Ghana. The findings were strange to the extent that word-of-mouth marketing has been lauded as one of the most potent marketing communications tools in services marketing but the empirical findings from the study did not support this. Practical implications: To the extent that proximity is a key factor in the opening and maintenance of bank relationships in Ghana, distribution management must be given a more strategic imperative in bank management in Ghana. Bank branches must be sited in catchment areas with the highest propensity to attract and maintain an existing profitable bank clientele. Originality/value: The study is one of the few on bank marketing in Ghana that draws on a large bank consumer data set and utilizes robust statistical analysis to reach its conclusions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Hinson R.; Owusu-Frimpong N.; Dasah J.,Strategic,10.1108/02652320910979898,Banking; Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Ghana,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the competitive landscape of banking in Ghana and emphasizes the importance of strategic decisions such as branch location to attract and maintain customers.

"Centurion Community Services (CCS), a social service agency situated in Lyttelton, Pretoria, was founded in February 1999. The geographical area where services were rendered over the past four years has been transformed from a once quiet rural scene to a densely populated urban area. The founding of CCS testifies to a pro-active step to address anticipated social problems associated with urbanisation. A qualitative study was launched with the aim to assess the community's perception concerning CCS and whether this service is able to fulfil the needs and wants of the community with a view of development of guidelines for a consumer-based marketing strategy. A schedule covering the seven critical areas of decision-making in a marketing strategy had been developed and utilised as a data collection instrument to collect data from respondents, who have all been beneficiaries in one way or another of this service. It was found that a strategic planning process should be implemented in order to obtain clarity regarding the vision and mission of the organization; a marketing plan (which includes the strategic analysis, the SWOT analysis, marketing objectives and marketing strategy) should be applied extensively. A number of recommendations regarding critical decision making areas were also formulated.",Naudé M.C.; Terblanche L.S.,Strategic,,,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the need for strategic planning and the development of a marketing strategy in a social service agency, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and direction.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,The development of a marketing strategy by Centurion Community Services; [Die ontwikkeling van 'n bemarkingstrategie vir centurion gemeenskapsdiens],2004
"Digital goods lend themselves to versioning but also suffer from piracy losses. This paper develops a pricing model for digital experience goods in a segmented market and explores the optimality of sampling as a piracy-mitigating strategy. Consumers are aware of the true fit of an experience good to their tastes only after consumption, and as piracy offers an additional (albeit illegal) consumption opportunity, traditional segmentation findings from economics and sampling recommendations from marketing, need to be revisited. We develop a two-stage model of piracy for a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation for quality and their moral costs. In our model, some consumers pirate the product in the first stage allowing them to update their fit-perception that may result in re-evaluation of their buying/pirating decision in the second stage. We recommend distinct pricing and sampling strategies for underestimated and overestimated products and suggest that any potential benefits of piracy can be internalized through product sampling. Two counterintuitive results stand out. First, piracy losses are more severe for products that do not live up to their hype rather than for those that have been undervalued in the market, thus requiring a greater deterrence investment for the former, and second, unlike physical goods where sampling is always beneficial for underestimated products, sampling for digital goods is optimal only under narrowly denned circumstances due to the price boundaries created by both piracy and segmentation. © 2005 INFORMS.",Chellappa R.K.; Shivendu S.,Strategic,10.1287/isre.1050.0069,Digital products; Experience goods; Piracy; Pricing; Sampling; Vertical segmentation,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The paper discusses pricing strategies and market segmentation for digital experience goods, focusing on long-term implications and strategic decisions to mitigate piracy losses.

"Purpose - To examine how companies are affected by economic crises, to assess the effects of marketing strategies on company performance in such conditions, and to identify those that can help companies to maintain successful performance despite turbulence in the operational environment. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire contained questions relating to 21 marketing strategies, associated with the elements of the marketing mix, plus a ""general marketing strategies"" category. It was completed by 172 Turkish companies, drawn from a national frame of 1,000. Data were analysed by factor analysis, with performance criteria set as the dependent variable. Results are reported for each of the elements of the marketing mix. Findings - Companies that modify their strategies appropriately can maintain or improve their performance in times of crisis. Conclusions and recommendations identify the strategic changes most likely to achieve that outcome, measured mainly in terms of sales, market share and profitability. Research limitations/implications - Subjective measures of performance were used because of practical obstacles to obtaining objective financial data from the sample, which would have severely reduced the response rate. Future studies should include such data in the analysis. They might also cross-index findings by company size, industry sector and market scope, and take account of company resources and skills. Practical implications - The findings provide valuable insights for decision makers and marketing planners in times of economic crisis, specifically in the Turkish context but potentially in general. Originality/value - Adds a specific focus on marketing strategies to existing studies of general measures taken by companies during economic crises.",Köksal M.H.; Özgül E.,Strategic,10.1108/02634500710754574,Company performance; Economic cycles; Marketing mix; Marketing strategy; Turkey,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses how companies can adapt their marketing strategies to improve performance during economic crises, which aligns with long-term planning and strategic adjustments within organizations.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,The relationship between marketing strategies and performance in an economic crisis,2007
"Most consumer decisions involve trade-offs of costs and benefits over time. The research literature on ""intertemporal choice"" examines behavioral regularities in how people think about such decisions, drawing from marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics. This diverse literature is relevant to the analysis of public policy issues related to consumers' discounting of future outcomes ""too much"" compared with sooner outcomes. A stream of outcomes can be viewed as occurring in three temporal regions: the present, the near future, and the more distant future. Somewhat different research streams have developed around the topic of underweighting outcomes in the distant (compared with the near) future and of overweighting outcomes in the present compared with any point in the future. The authors review key concepts from the literature on underweighting the distant future versus the near-term future to analyze policy issues related to consumers' saving for retirement and their response to rebates. The authors review key concepts from the literature on impulsive behavior and present-biased preferences to analyze the problems of self-control that people have in their consumption of ""sin"" products that are proximate and that affect rewards in the present. The authors critique current information and incentive remedies that ignore behavioral principles from the literature, focusing their recommendations on policy interventions designed to influence eating habits and obesity and on cooling-off laws that govern return policies for consumers' big-ticket purchases. © 2006, American Marketing Association.",Lynch Jr. J.G.; Zauberman G.,Strategic,10.1509/jppm.25.1.67,,5.0,,10,5,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses long-term behavioral patterns in consumer decision-making and public policy implications, which align with strategic planning and the analysis of overarching goals related to consumer behavior over time.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,"When do you want it?

"Internet companies extensively use the practice of drop-shipping, where the wholesaler stocks and owns the inventory and ships products directly to customers at retailers' request. Under the drop-shipping arrangement, the supply chain benefits from risk pooling because the inventory for multiple retailers is stocked at the same location, the wholesaler's. Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in which retailers stock and own the inventory. These two supply chain structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability, the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and transportation costs. © 2006 INFORMS.",Netessine S.; Rudi N.,Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.1060.0512,Competition; Drop-shipping; E-commerce; Equilibrium; Fulfillment; Supply chain,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses various supply chain structures and their implications for inventory management, risk allocation, and profitability, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategies.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Supply chain choice on the internet,2006

"The Cape Shoe Company case focuses on an entrepreneurial start-up in the highly competitive shoe industry. Upon the closing of a Florsheim shoe factory in a region of the Midwest that was once home to a large number of shoe and apparel manufacturers, with the majority of these having closed over the previous 30 years due to lower cost of overseas production, and concerned about the continuing loss of shoe manufacturing in the U.S., an entrepreneur from Chicago with minimal experience in the shoe industry, visited a Florsheim factory prior to its closing by Florsheim. After deciding that the facility represented too valuable a resource to be abandoned, the entrepreneur subsequently purchased the shoe plant and named his new venture the Cape Shoe Company. Based on his concern about losing American manufacturing jobs, and the belief that he could produce a competitively priced product, his plan was to produce 100 percent Made in America shoes. The interesting focus of this particular case and ensuing discussions is that the entrepreneur has made the decision to go forward with Cape Shoe Company and his 100 percent Made in America theme, although having yet to determine target market(s), competition, product differentiation, marketing channels, marketing strategies, etc. Regarding the rather unique nature of the Cape Shoe Company start-up, and current industry scenario, students virtually have a clean slate in which to begin discussions concerning recommendations on strategic management and marketing questions.",Fishman E.; Sterrett J.L.; Kellerman B.J.; Gordon P.J.,Strategic,,,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the formation of the Cape Shoe Company and the entrepreneur's long-term vision to produce 100 percent Made in America shoes.

"The presence of international students is a valuable input for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) at all levels. Thus, it is critical to understand not only how students make their decisions and what factors and sources of information provided by the HEI most influence them, but also to evaluate students’ satisfaction and loyalty with the choice made, in order to define the most suitable and competitive marketing strategies to attract and retain international students. Based on the information gathered through a questionnaire with a sample of 190 international students studying at a Portuguese HEI, a quantitative, cross-sectional and causal study was conducted using the estimation of a structural equation model calculated through PLS, in order to investigate the impact of choice factors and information sources on international students’ loyalty, mediated by satisfaction with the choice made. The findings indicate that the choice factors with the greatest impact on satisfaction of the international students were: the perception of the country, the environment and location of the HEI, and the sources of information provided by the HEI. It was also concluded that a positive global perception of the HEI influences the recommendation from significant others, and increases the satisfaction and loyalty of all the international students.

"An essential function that is recommended for destinations and tourism and hospitality organizations to undertake is to learn about developments in the external environment that may have a substantial impact on the competitiveness of their business. The healthy-living lifestyle has been gaining momentum in the USA and in various parts of the world; more than ever, programs, products, and regulations are being developed and implemented to cater to members of the mentioned lifestyle and to support the overall well being of societies.

To illustrate, four samples of festivals from the UK, Australia, Norway and Sweden are systematically compared in terms of their ownership, governance, structure, and content. Although the festivals offered a similar product and had similar mandates, they differed considerably in terms of revenue sources, cost structure, use of volunteers, corporate sponsorship, and decision-making.

"Recent studies have shown that consumers' product choices are significantly influenced by media coverage and recommendations in various media outlets. Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002-2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States.

"Purpose - This paper aims to note the imitation of apparently successful advertising as a replacement for thought by too many advertisers, misapplying the tactics of what seem to be past successes by other companies to current situations, sometimes not even attempting to find insight relevant to the current advertising situation. Imitation of what may be lucky accidents has become a tool for improper applications of old tactics to new problems. Design/methodology/approach - Noting the frequent pronouncements by business journalists that many businesses do things because they know they ""work,"" the reality is that even among marketing professionals, conventional wisdom is often, at best, an oxymoron. Findings - The pragmatic business need is to analyze new situations and consumer interests. Originality/value - The paper shows that, since advertising decisions are often the recommendations from outside suppliers, business managers who pay for this advice must realize that past success by others does not mean that an imitative effort will enjoy similar success.

"With dramatic changes in the policies and practices of marketing healthcare to the public, providers of mental health services are being forced to consider strategies for more effectively and competitively promoting their services. Little empirical information relating to the manner in which prospective clients choose such services in a competitive, and often confusing, marketplace is currently available. The purpose of this study was to explore search strategies that might be used by consumers to identify potential providers of mental health services. In the present study, young adults were asked to rate the likelihood of using each of 19 empirically-derived sources of information in selecting a mental health provider. Factor analysis, as well as descriptive item analyses, suggest that, as is the case with certain other health care decision-making situations, consumers are most likely to depend on personal sources of information such as physician referrals and recommendations from friends and co-workers. In addition, several sources converge to suggest the importance to providers of establishing relationships with other professionals and with institutions in order to successfully market their services. Patterns of responses, including gender differences related to the likelihood with which certain search strategies would be utilized, have implications for model development and marketing strategy. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Lipscomb T.J.; Root T.; Shelley K.,Strategic,10.1300/J396v25n04_01,Consumer decision-making; Help-seeking; Mental health; Services marketing; Therapist,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on exploring search strategies for consumers to select mental health services, indicating a long-term goal of understanding consumer behavior and improving marketing strategies in a competitive environment.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Strategies for seeking mental health services,2004
"The defense industry has been experiencing a large draw-down during the 1990s. This has left many companies, large and small, in a situation where they had to examine the viability and future of their businesses. While large and medium-size companies were somewhat assisted by government policies and support, small subcontractors were often left alone, facing higher risks and severe threats to their future. This research investigated the events, decisions, activities and success of small defense contractors, which had to face this new situation. It developed a specific framework, which may be used to help companies in assessing their conversion efforts. The study was conducted by utilizing a within-case and cross-case methodology for case study analysis. Results assert the difficulties for highly defense dependent companies to enter and succeed in the commercial market and explain why many conversion efforts have often failed in the past. Our findings show that to convert successfully, companies must streamline and improve their internal processes, develop a strategic plan, develop their marketing capabilities, and must have management and employee commitment to the process. Although such recommendations were expected, we found, that to many of these companies, they were completely new.

"Purpose - The study outlined in this paper seeks to deepen one's understanding of the theoretical and practical implications for marketing management where an internet component has been added to the business. Design/methodology/approach - Cases were developed primarily from individual in-depth interviews with 30 managers from financial services. Findings - In setting up an e-commerce capability the case study organizations have been taking strategic decisions on customer interaction. Aligning channels cost-effectively with appropriate customers requires difficult decisions to be made in targeting and managing different customer segments. At the operational level many aspects of customer interaction can be handled centrally, moving the emphasis of customer management into customer service departments. Research limitations/implications - The question of how best to manage customers effectively, using e-service in an integrated manner with other channels, can be seen to be complex and requires further research in order to extend theory in this area and give more meaningful guidance to marketing practitioners. Practical implications - The marketing function has the potential to play a prime role in ensuring that remote customer management is effective. Recommendations are made for practising managers on developing an integrated channel strategy; setting up processes for managing customer feedback from the new channels and responding to this feedback. Originality/value - E-service is throwing up new and fundamental challenges for organizations and this potentially provides new opportunities for marketing practitioners to play a leading role at strategic and operational levels. However, in the cases marketing management's strategic and operational contribution to resolving these issues was limited.",Hughes T.,Strategic,10.1108/08876040710758577,Case studies; Marketing management,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the strategic implications of integrating e-service into marketing management, emphasizing the need for long-term planning and decision-making regarding customer interaction and channel alignment.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Regaining a seat at the table: Marketing management and the e-service opportunity,2007
"Alpine landscapes arouse emotions and yearnings: feelings of belongings, freedom, or holidays. Images and notions about Alpine landscapes not only influence landscape experiences, they also play an important role in decision-making processes and conflict mitigation. Different stakeholders - ie locals, tourists, tourist entreprenuers, politicians, farmers, hunters, etc - regard Alpine landscapes with different eyes, yet there are also connecting elements: these are referred to in tourism marketing and in political dialogue. The present article develops a conceptual model landscape perception consisting of 4 poles - 'nature' and 'culture' as well as 'individual' and 'society' - that contributes to a better understanding of the meanings that landscapes have for different people. The model helps to find existing commonalities among stakeholders and overcome obstacles. It is exemplified by 6 dimensions with distinct foci on landscapes through which researchers look at Alpine landscapes.

"Reflecting recent European and International trends, the Irish financial services sector has witnessed phenomenal technological and competitive developments, affecting consumer decision–making and behaviour and forcing financial suppliers to re–assess their approach to setting customer expectations and assessing the consumer experience. This study, using a purposive sample of financial services managers and experts, shows suppliers increasingly struggling to practice external accountability to their customers and internal accountability to their employees. In terms of external accountability, suppliers identified numerous brand–related issues and challenges, including the increasing lack of brand differentiation and the difficulties in creating meaningful brand images, which are posing significant difficulties in creating positive and appealing customer expectations. In relation to internal accountability, suppliers highlighted the challenges associated with empowering their employees to provide a personal and superior service and meeting the evolving requirements of an increasingly diverse customer base. Recommendations are made in relation to the incorporation of consumer research, internal marketing and technology in order to provide a banking experience which facilitates supplier commitment and accountability to both customers and employees. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",O'loughlin D.; Szmigin I.,Strategic,10.1080/09652540500083008,Expectations vs. experience; Financial supplier accountability; Irish banking sector,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses long-term trends and challenges within the Irish financial services sector, focusing on external and internal accountability, brand differentiation, and consumer expectations.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss and assess the consecutive Governments' policy for coal (1989-2006) in the context of the systemic transformation of the Polish economy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a critical analysis of the rationale and effectiveness of government efforts to restructure the Polish coal mining industry in the light of economic theory, published literature, and a survey of three collieries. Some parallels, toutes proportions gardées, are drawn between the situation in the UK under Margaret Thatcher and that in Poland. Findings: The paper arguesthat, despite throwing billions of zlotys at the industry in the form of direct subsidies and debt write-offs, decision makers failed to make the collieries economically sound. The weaknesses of the consecutive governments - manifesting itself, amongst other things, in the unwillingness and/or inability to confront the miners' unions, to introduce market mechanisms into the sector, to ensure competent management and, crucially, to press on with nationwide economic liberalisation - are seen as the principal reasons behind the failure. Practical implications: The paper highlights the root causes of government ineffectiveness as well as aspires to provide policy recommendations with a view to rendering the Polish coal industry economically viable in a free-market reality. Originality/value - It presents the coal mining industry as a relic of socialism and highlights the inconsistencies and inadequacies of the consecutive restructuring programmes; concludes that restructuring efforts - to be truly effective - have to be co-ordinated with nationwide economic liberalisation.",Zientara P.,Strategic,10.1108/17506220710821143,Coal; Government policy; Poland,10.0,,5,5,,"The abstract discusses the long-term policy for coal in Poland, assessing government effectiveness and recommending restructuring aligned with economic liberalization.

"This study aims to discover marketing professionals' perceptions on ethical problems and current level of ethics in Greece, as well as, on the policy instruments used by companies to help employees make decisions in a more ethical fashion, using a qualitative research design. Specifically, it reports the results of a series of in-depth interviews conducted with Greek marketing professional employed by multinationals in Greece. A number of topics examining ethical problems, ethical standards, corporate policy instruments and corporate culture served as a basis for discussion. While the occasionally contrasting opinions revealed in part the perplexity of marketing ethics, respondents also arrived at points of convergence. All recognized government as playing the most prominent role in issues of public concern, legislation and overall ethical standards. Moreover, all marketers identified multinational and other foreign firms as a positive influence to the level of ethics, due to the introduction of policy instruments and control mechanisms. Finally, they also accepted the need for better informed customers and a strong organizational culture.

"This article presents the results of a study of the evaluation by more than 300 bank decision-makers of relationship marketing strategies used by their suppliers. The research identifies both explanatory and normative /actors of relationship marketing and its successful implementation. The main contingency factors are related to salesperson's knowledge of the customer, the existence of an atmosphere of trust and, the presence of a customer-oriented culture in the supplier company. Dimensions of relationships important for relationship marketing are relationship length, the customer's ability to adapt within the relationship, as well as the perceived fairness of the relationship, and this is reflected in findings where durability, adaptability, and equity explain supplier performance as measured by their client's satisfaction and recommendations.

"An important problem for organizations is managing information systems (IS) to support important business functions. The purpose of this research was to investigate and determine the extent, if any, that perspectives of IS planning and management advocated in the US literature could be found in practice in Chinese business organizations. Semi-structured interviews with general managers and IS directors in five Chinese business organizations were conducted to address this problem in the four areas of IS planning support, IS planning methodologies, data resource management, and the IS manager's role. The results reveal that Chinese 4business organizations do not automate administrative and business record keeping activities as their first step. Instead, they place highest priority on implementing systems that provide information to support management control decision making in meeting planned business performance objectives, such as achieving sales quotas or filling customer contracts on time. The results of this study show that the five Chinese businesses aligned their IS applications with a specific few business functions that were critical to successful achievement of their goals. The IS manager served as a manager of technical issues, which reinforced a technical database modelling approach to managing the data resources for IS applications. Implications and recommendations for incorporating IS into business activities are discussed and presented at the end of the paper for multinational business organizations interested in conducting business in China.

"The complexity of strategic market planning is well known to those working in this area. It requires many expert and intuitive judgements based on a number of interrelated, yet diverse, market factors. It would seem that expert systems and decision support systems might have a large impact in this area but the development of such systems has proven difficult with results, so far, less than originally conceived. This paper describes a hybrid expert system HYMS for strategic marketing planning. HYMS aims to provide a structured marketing planning process, guide a user through this process, offer expert advice at key stages and finally make recommendations for users in setting objectives and strategies. It combines the advantages of the expert system and decision support system technology in order to enhance its effectiveness. The paper first presents a brief review on expert systems and decision support systems in marketing. It also discusses the selection of a strategic marketing planning model for HYMS and a method by which structure and objectivity are introduced into the, largely subjective, process of assigning importance to various marketing factors. Finally, it describes the architecture of the prototype system and concludes with remarks from expert users in this field. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Burrell P.; Duan Y.; Boskovic A.,Strategic,10.1080/12460125.1995.10511662,Analytic hierarchy process; Decision support; Expert system; Marketing; Strategic management,10.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a hybrid expert system for strategic marketing planning, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making processes.

"Considerable controversy and debate surrounds the practice of slotting allowances, or fees, paid by manufacturers for obtaining the patronage of retailers. To date, regulators have yet to agree on public policy toward these practices; at least one federal antitrust agency suggests that slotting fees may be competitive, another has conducted investigations into these practices, and still another suggests banning them altogether. In this article, the authors examine the recent decision by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) to prohibit slotting allowances in the retail sale of alcohol beverages. Focusing on the regulatory environment, industry structure, marketing practices, and consumer consumption behavior in the alcohol beverage industry, the authors analyze the BATF's decision and attempt to reconcile disparate public policy treatment of these practices.

"Policymakers in many developing Asian countries have commonly relied on investment incentives as a major policy instrument to attract foreign investment. Using comparative case studies of Asian transnational corporations (TNCs) in Southeast Asia, this paper argues that investment incentives per se are ineffective in attracting foreign investment. The paper first examines the role of government incentives in the inflow of foreign investment, with particular reference to the Southeast Asian region. It then provides a comparative study of Hong Kong and Taiwanese investments. Hong Kong TNCs are shown to have invested in Southeast Asia because of market or market‐related reasons, not investment incentives per se. To these firms from Hong Kong, investment incentives are more a kind of post hoc rationalization of their decision making. For the Taiwanese investors in Malaysia, government incentives are less important than the existence of market access and the friendly host country environment. The paper also suggests some implications and specific policy recommendations for policymakers in host country governments. Instead of over‐reliance on investment incentives, host country governments should be more concerned with: 1) a commitment to internationalization through the promotion and marketing of international images; 2) the upgrading of domestic resources through continuous training and development; 3) a more efficient allocation of resources; 4) supra‐national coordination and promotion. © Routledge 1996.",Yeung H.W.,Strategic,10.1080/09512749608719201,,10.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses long-term policy implications for attracting foreign investment in developing Asian countries, emphasizing the need for a broader strategic approach beyond investment incentives.",scopus-recommendation,60,15,Attracting foreign investment?

"The Janus Commission was established by 1995-96 AACP President Mary-Anne Koda-Kimble to scan the health care environment and to identify, analyze, and predict those changes within the environment likely to profoundly influence pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical education, and research; and to alert the academy to both threats and opportunities that such environmental changes present. Throughout its deliberations, the Commission was drawn repeatedly to the pervasive influence of a changing, more intensively integrated and managed health care system on both pharmaceutical education and pharmacy practice. This fundamental change in health care has been the primary influence in the Commission's thinking and recommendations. The Commission believes that a revised model for pharmaceutical education is needed to meet the challenges presented by the changing health care system. In particular, schools and colleges of pharmacy must become true ""activists"" in health care policy, services delivery, and research in order to effectively achieve their missions in professional education. Employing the analogy of the pharmaceutical industry, the Commission suggests the following fundamental areas of emphasis for schools and colleges: • the need for enhanced research and development activities related to the provision of, compensation for, and outcomes of pharmaceutical care; • sustained curricular reform efforts that assure successful ""manufacturing"" of competent and caring pharmaceutical care providers; • aggressive ""marketing"" programs, working in collaboration with the profession of pharmacy, that promote the delivery of pharmaceutical care and foster enhanced practice/education partnerships; and • enhanced interaction with the ""product"" of professional education programs, the pharmacist, to assure that graduates can and will continue to provide effective clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes in the course of their professional careers. Finally drawing upon the previous works of the Pew Health Professions Commission and the AACP Commission to Implement Change in Pharmaceutical Education, the Janus Commission believes that fundamental actions must be taken immediately within the academy to assure the future success of our professional programs and graduates within the evolving health care system. Among these are: • completion of the evolution of the ""values system"" of pharmaceutical education toward producing graduates who are patient-centered providers of pharmaceutical care; • active involvement by administrators and faculty of colleges and schools of pharmacy in health care system decision-making, policy determinations, and research activities; and • creation by colleges and schools of action-oriented business plans that result in effective partnerships with practice organizations and health care delivery systems. The Commission encourages a thorough and critical reading of its report and looks forward to a very healthy, lively, and productive dialogue within the academy over the next several months.",Bootman J.L.; Hunter R.H.; Kerr R.A.; Lipton H.L.; Mauger J.W.; Roche V.F.,Strategic,,,5.0,,10,5,American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy,"The abstract discusses long-term goals and fundamental changes needed in pharmaceutical education and practice in response to the evolving healthcare environment, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Approaching the millennium: The report the AACP Janus Commission,1997
"Effective system design for service sector outlets requires the explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of its myriad elements. Facility design decisions as well as tactical, operational choices must recognize the marketing environment, including competitive and demographic factors, and their interactions. The particular design and operational features selected for a given retail service outlet will affect its sales, fixed and variable costs, service levels, efficiency, and profits. We consider a fast food chain contemplating acquiring, building, and operating a new outlet at a particular candidate site, with its own particular environment. We offer a normative approach for this type of decision, which arrives endogenously at the best choices for both design and operational features for the site. The final decision as to whether or not to actually acquire, build, and operate the outlet at the candidate site thus depends on several complex connected choices. Our implementable approach integrates the non-parametric allocative data envelopment analysis methodology with parametric regression analysis to yield a mathematical programming optimization model. We illustrate the approach with actual data from Hardee's, a fast food chain with over 3100 outlets, and an actual candidate site. The recommendations from the approach are compared with those from the conventional approach. A key advantage of our approach is its contrast to conventional approaches for site selection which ignore the more detailed design and operational choices. Additionally, the conventional approaches do not recognize the real possibility that labor and material costs might be affected by these choices. In conventional approaches, two types of errors can occur: (i) an incorrect ""go/no-go"" decision could be recommended for the site in question, and (ii) even if the optimal design choices are coincidentally identified, the forecasted level of annualized profits could be quite different, leading to an incorrect decision or priority about acquiring, building, and operating the candidate outlet. Other key advantages of our suggested approach are that: (i) various substitution possibilities (between more or less capital, labor, material, etc.) are considered, (ii) not only is the best configuration identified, but also a ranking of the possible configurations is available to help in sensitivity analyses and answering ""what-if"" questions, (iii) other specific sites (which serve as the basis for the recommendations) are identified, thereby enabling management (through site visits) to isolate the actual processes and procedures to be employed at the candidate site, and (iv) identify economies of scale possible. In summary, our approach identifies the chain's best practices in different environments, thereby enabling management to factor out poor performances due to flawed installation, lack of proper worker incentives, etc. Also, while the illustration is for a fast food outlet, the approach is equally appropriate for other service outlets, e.g., banks, hospitals, or pharmacies. © 1993.",Banker R.D.; Morey R.C.,Strategic,10.1016/0272-6963(93)90035-N,,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses long-term considerations for facility design decisions in the service sector, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various elements affecting sales, costs, service levels, and profits.

"The “go/no-go” decision for a candidate property, i.e., whether or not to actually acquire the site, choose the brand (flag), build and operate the hotel, requires the explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of the many myriad elements affecting the property's potential profits. The many facility design decisions (number and mix of rooms, capacity for F&B operations etc.) as well as other strategic choices (e.g., size of marketing program, level of service aimed for) must recognize the site's competitive features and interactions with the above. Also, the particular design and operational features for a given property will affect its different revenue streams, fixed and variable costs, efficiency and profits. The authors consider developers contemplating acquiring a given site, choosing a brand, building and operating a new hotel. They offer a normative approach for this type of decision which arrives endogenously at possibly attractive options for the brand, design and strategic choices for the site. The final decision as to which option to actually use, if any, should be based on subjecting the above identified scenarios, as well as others, to traditional feasibility analyses where judgment and expert opinion are applied. The authors' implementable approach integrates a “best practices” benchmarking methodology with regression analysis to yield a mathematical programming optimization model. A key advantage of this approach lies in its contrast to conventional approaches for site selection which often ignore the more detailed design and strategic choices. The approach deals explicitly with the complex interfaces between marketing and operations management as the endogenous site and competitive environmental factors interact with the endogenous brand and facility design choices. By identifying attractive options to be further explored (that might otherwise be overlooked), several types of errors are avoided: i) an incorrect “go/no go” decision could be recommended for the site in question; ii) even if the right decision to proceed is made, the forecasted level of annualized profits could be in error, leading to an incorrect priority for the activity; iii) the incorrect brand and facility design choices could be made for the site. Other key advantages of the suggested approach are that 1) various substitution possibilities (between more or less capital, labor, materials etc.) are considered; 2) not only is the best brand and configuration identified, but also a ranking of other brands is available if the “best” brand is not available; 3) the “best practices” at other specific sites (which serve as the basis for the recommendations) are identified, thereby enabling management (possibly through site visits) to isolate the actual cultures, processes and procedures to be transported and emulated at the candidate site. This paper illustrates the approach for two different sites. © 1997, ICHRIE.

"Most American firms are concerned with improving their quality. Unfortunately, the current literature does not give a comprehensive theoretical model in order to evaluate each recommendation economically. Because of the lack of a theoretical model and the complexity of quality improvement systems, integrative efforts coordinating marketing and production have been largely ineffective in the strategies of firms, since they have not been subject to traditional cost-benefit analysis. This study develops an integrative strategic quality management theory and a cost-benefit model which put quality improvement programmes into the traditional decision-making framework.

"This paper examines the role of market research in the decision process used to invest in continuing care retirement centers (CCRCs). Given changing demographics and the availability of financing, there has been a rapid increase in the number of CCRCs that are being developed. However, a large number of these centers have either failed or are experiencing financial difficulty. Some industry participants have blamed poor or inadequate market research as a factor contributing to the failure of many centers to meet expectations. This paper discusses how the process used to invest in centers and how the motivations of the different actors in the investment decision can influence the role and use of market research.

"As the global organic food market continues to grow, so too will the challenges associated with managing organic food supply chains. We consider an entry mode selection problem facing an organic farmer. Specifically, an incumbent conventional farmer is selling its product through an independent retailer on the market. An organic farmer aiming to enter the market faces the problem of selecting between the conventional farmer's retailer and an organic-only retailer. Consumers are heterogeneous in their purchasing valuation of the conventional agricultural product and its organic alternative. Horizontal competition between the two competing farmers is considered under different scenarios. Multiple-stage games are analyzed to study the impact of different cases on the pricing decision and profit of each player. The results show that when the organic agricultural product enters the market through the incumbent conventional retailer, two types of products are sold through a common retailer, the competition between the two farmers will be intensified, and the profit at the retail end will increase. It is always better for the organic farmer to sell an organic agricultural product through an independent organic-only retailer than to sell it through the incumbent conventional retailer. The paper makes two contributions. First, we derive the explicit equilibrium under chain-to-chain competition with piecewise linear demand functions. Second, we link the analytical marketing literature on channel structures with the supply chain literature on chain-to-chain competition and apply them to the food supply chain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Pu X.; Xu Z.; Huang R.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122716,Chain-to-chain competition; Entry; Food supply chain; Mode selection,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term decisions regarding market entry and pricing strategies for organic farmers against conventional farmers, which aligns with strategic planning and market competition analysis.",scopus-robot,60,25,Entry mode selection and its impact on the competition between organic and conventional agricultural products,2020
"Undoubtedly, high demands from food from the world-wide growing population are impacting the environment and putting many pressures on agricultural productivity. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture, enormous farming data, such as agricultural information, capacity buildings, training, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. e-Learning technologies have clearly emerged as development poles for rural development and food security through growths for access to knowledge and exchange through advance agricultural communication tools. A multistage random sampling technique was used by 300 selected e-Learning users from rural areas with a simple linear regression model via SPSS. A comprehensive analysis is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research. One of the main obstacles that farmers were not aware and training of technical information flows in rural development. Therefore, ICTs services and applications have been highly significant for agricultural technical capacity in rural development.

"Background: Built heritage in developed tourism destinations presents a resource of attractiveness, and its presentation through digital technology impacts the perception of culture. Objectives: The paper aims to determine opportunities for further development of digital promotion of cultural attractions by identifying the potential of websites, online marketing tools and smart technologies implemented by tourism attraction decision-makers. Methods/Approach: Qualitative and qualitative research methods were used as longitudinal research and structured interviews with decision-makers of the tourist destination. Results: Positive developments in implementing the digital promotion of cultural heritage during and after the pandemic are evident, but not fast enough considering the accelerated development of new smart technologies. At the same time, decision-makers recognise the importance of the digital promotion of cultural heritage. However, they are still unfamiliar with the possibilities of smart technology to affirm the digital promotion of cultural heritage.

"Using text-mining, the authors develop version 1.0 of the Relevance to Marketing (R2M) Index, a dynamic index that measures the topical and timely relevance of academic marketing articles to marketing practice. The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures. Because the index is a work in progress, the authors discuss how to overcome current limitations and suggest correlating the index with citation counts, altmetrics, and readability measures. Marketing practitioners, authors, and journal editors can use the index to assess article relevance, and academic administrators can use it for promotion and tenure decisions (see www.R2Mindex.com).

"An important use of the internet today is in providing a platform for consumers to disseminate information about products and services they buy, and share experiences about the merchants with whom they transact. Increasingly, online markets develop into social shopping channels, and facilitate the creation of online communities and social networks. Till date, businesses, government organisations and customers have not fully incorporated such information in their decision making and policy formulation processes, either because the potential value of the intellectual capital or appropriate techniques for measuring that value have not been identified. Increasingly, although, this publicly available digital content has concrete economic value that is often hidden beneath the surface. For example, online product reviews affect the buying behaviour of customers, as well as the volume of sales, positively or negatively. Similarly, user feedback on sites such as eBay and Amazon affect the reputation of online merchants and, in turn, their ability to sell their products and services. Our research on the EconoMining project studies the economic value of user-generated content in such online settings. In our research program, we combine established techniques from economics and marketing with text mining algorithms from computer science to measure the economic value of each text snippet. In this paper, we describe the foundational blocks of our techniques, and demonstrate the value of user-generated content in a variety of areas, including reputation systems and online product reviews, and we present examples of how such areas are of immediate importance to the travel industry. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.",Ghose A.; Ipeirotis P.,Strategic,10.1057/rpm.2008.56,E-commerce; Econometrics; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; User-generated content,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of user-generated content on business decision-making and policy formulation, indicating a focus on the overarching goals and the economic value associated with such content in online markets.",scopus-text mining,60,25,The EconoMining project at NYU: Studying the economic value of user-generated content on the internet,2009
"This study aims to evaluate B2B branding in a global context by constructing a framework for future research, practitioners, and brand managers operating in international B2B markets.

"Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period.

"Cause-related marketing (C-RM) has risen to become a popular strategy to increase business value through profit-motivated giving. Despite the growing number of articles published in the last decade, no comprehensive analysis of the most discussed constructs of cause-related marketing is available. This paper uses an advanced Text Mining methodology (a Bayesian contextual analysis algorithm known as Correlated Topic Model, CTM) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 246 articles published in 40 different journals between 1988 and 2013 on the subject of cause-related marketing. Text Mining also allows quantitative analyses to be performed on the literature. For instance, it is shown that the most prominent long-term topics discussed since 1988 on the subject are “brand-cause fit”, “law and Ethics”, and “corporate and social identification”, while the most actively discussed topic presently is “sectors raising social taboos and moral debates”. The paper has two goals: first, it introduces the technique of CTM to the Marketing area, illustrating how Text Mining may guide, simplify, and enhance review processes while providing objective building blocks (topics) to be used in a review; second, it applies CTM to the C-RM field, uncovering and summarizing the most discussed topics.

"Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO) have received substantial conceptual and empirical attention in the marketing and management literature and both orientations have consistently been linked to stronger financial performance. Yet the way in which market-oriented firms seek to achieve superior rents is substantively different from that of entrepreneurially oriented firms which could lead to differential impacts of EO and MO on firm risk. In this study, the authors employ a text mining technique to assess firms' EO and MO and examine the impact of these two strategic orientations on shareholder risk outcomes. The results show that while EO increases idiosyncratic risk, MO decreases it. However, only EO decreases systematic risk. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that a firm's decisions regarding strategic orientation should be examined in light of both likely risks and returns in order to make appropriate resource allocation decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Bhattacharya A.; Misra S.; Sardashti H.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2019.01.004,Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm risk; Market orientation; Shareholder return; Text analysis,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the impact of entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation on financial performance and risk, which relates to long-term strategic planning and resource allocation decisions within organizations.",scopus-text mining,70,15,Strategic orientation and firm risk,2019
"A firm’s strategic emphasis on value creation versus appropriation, which is typically reflected in its resource allocation between R&D and advertising, is a central corporate decision that significantly influences financial performance. However, the drivers of such decisions remain underexplored. This study identifies a significant predictor of strategic emphasis, namely, corporate managerial hubris, and reveals some of its boundary conditions. Leveraging a unique dataset based on text mining of press releases issued by over 400 firms across 13 years, the authors demonstrate that high corporate managerial hubris predicts low strategic emphasis on advertising relative to R&D. However, this effect is mitigated significantly by firm maturity, corporate governance, and industry-level strategic emphasis. The results provide novel insights into the effects of hubris on firm spending, the situations wherein marketing decisions tend to be subject to managers’ psychological bias, the means of preventing over- or under-investment in marketing strategy, and the recruitment and training of managers. © The Author(s) 2017.",Kim M.; Xiong G.; Kim K.-H.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-017-0547-4,Advertising; Corporate managerial hubris; R&d; Strategic emphasis,10.0,,5,0,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses a firm's strategic emphasis on resource allocation between R&D and advertising, indicating long-term corporate decision-making that influences financial performance.

"The deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been accelerating in several fields over the past few years, with much focus placed on its potential in Business-to-Business (B2B) marketing. Early reports highlight promising benefits of AI in B2B marketing such as offering important insights into customer behaviors, identifying critical market insight, and streamlining operational inefficiencies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding con-cerning how organizations should structure their AI competencies for B2B marketing, and how these ultimately influence organizational performance. Drawing on AI competencies and B2B marketing literature, this study develops a conceptual research model that explores the effect that AI competencies have on B2B marketing capabilities, and in turn on organizational performance. The proposed research model is tested using 155 survey responses from European companies and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results highlight the mechanisms through which AI competencies influence B2B marketing capabilities, as well as how the later impact organizational performance.","Mikalef, P; Islam, N; Parida, V; Singh, H; Altwaijry, N",Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.113998,Artificial intelligence; B2B marketing; AI competencies; Core competencies theory,5.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the development of a conceptual research model that explores the impact of AI competencies on B2B marketing capabilities and organizational performance.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"Recent progress in data processing technology has made the accumulation and systematic organization of large volumes of data a routine activity. As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development. This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain. The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module. When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people.

"Acknowledging the lack of empirical research on the adoption of AI in B2B marketing and the research gap in studying power from a network perspective, this paper explores how the drivers of AI adoption as marketing solutions affect network actors' power dynamics. Using data collected through 20 semi-structured interviews with business managers and engineers involved in AI adoption for B2B marketing activities, as well as academic experts in the field of AI, this paper discusses how AI adoption priorities and motives shape the power dynamics amongst the various network actors, including focal firms, AI suppliers and tech giant companies. The findings show that, in the context of AI adoption in B2B, both technology and expertise are key sources of power, and that data creates and perpetuates power negotiations and renegotiations in the network. We envisage this process as the movements on a busy dancefloor where groups of actors are engaged in what we refer to as the Power Tango.

"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) transforming business-to-business (B2B) marketing, there is a growing demand to comprehensively understand the adoption and application of AI to advance B2B marketing. This study examines AI methods and their applications in B2B marketing across the four customer life cycle stages of reach, acquisition, conversion, and retention. The paper also analyzes and synthesizes the findings of five B2B industry surveys conducted to do the following: 1) examine B2B marketers' knowledge and attitudes toward using AI in their businesses, 2) determine the various ways in which AI is used in B2B marketing, and 3) investigate the perceived merits and challenges of using AI in B2B marketing. The findings reconcile various machine learning (ML) techniques suitable for use by B2B marketers. Employing the technology acceptance model (TAM), the paper identifies how B2B marketers perceive the benefits of AI adoption. Furthermore, this study discusses the perceived barriers to AI adoption, including data privacy challenges and the replacement of human workforces. To further highlight the benefits of AI, the study showcases three examples of successful AI adoption in B2B marketing.

"Development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key approach to achieving economic growth in the Middle East and successful adoption of technology is vital for SMEs' success and continuity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is part of a new generation of technologies that can facilitate competitive advantage but currently there is a lack of evidence regarding AI applications in relation to B2B SMEs in Middle East countries. Therefore, this study empirically examines antecedents to, and consequences of, successful acceptance of AI practices by B2B SMEs in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model based on the technology-organisation-environment framework is developed which considers the impact of AI enablers and AI readiness on the acceptance of AI practices, and the impact of this on relational governance, performance, and SMEs' AI-based business customer interaction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling of survey data collected from B2B SMEs (n = 392). The results showed that, of the AI enablers, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by both technology roadmapping and attitude but not professional expertise. Of the AI readiness variables, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by infrastructure and awareness but not technicality. The acceptance of AI practices was found to significantly affect AI-enabled relational governance and performance, and SME's business customer AI-based interaction. This study provides a broader base for theoretical and practical understanding of issues related to AI practices in SMEs and the B2B sector in general.","Baabdullah, AM; Alalwan, AA; Slade, EL; Raman, R; Khatatneh, KF",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.09.003,AI; SMEs; B2B; AI enablers; AI readiness; Customer AI-based interaction,5.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The study focuses on the long-term implications of AI adoption in B2B SMEs, examining how AI practices affect relational governance and performance.

"Data-driven analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have become the most crucial aspects of today's industrial marketing management. Although many firms have embraced analytics and AI strategies, corresponding academic advances have been slow. This research investigates how industrial goods manufacturers sustain their competitive advantage in export markets, convincing buyers in a competitive data-rich business environment. The evidence has been taken from the RMG (readymade garment) industry, one of the largest manufacturing industries significantly attached to the export markets. Utilizing multi-phase research design, the study reveals that firms marketing analytics capability play a vital role in sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring the market, consequently leading to a sustained competitive advantage. The performance of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring becomes higher for a firm when they adopt AI on the strength of the marketing analytics platform.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13-15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade. This article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better go-to-development investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies. Despite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the early adopter stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues. High uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered. The article ends with a call to action, aimed at both practitioners and academics: AI is the most significant innovation in our lifetime! It's time we all got on board.","Cooper, RG",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.03.008,Artificial intelligence; New product development; AI in NPD; Product innovation,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of AI adoption in new product development, focusing on its transformative potential and the need for organizations to adapt to leverage AI effectively.

"Decision-making in marketing has changed dramatically in the past decade. Companies increasingly use algorithms to generate predictions for marketing decisions, such as which consumers to target with which offers. Such algorithmic decision-making promises to make marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective. Not surprisingly, machine learning is a trending topic for marketing researchers and practitioners. However, machine learning also introduces important challenges to the marketing landscape. We discuss this development by outlining recent progress and future research directions of machine learning in marketing. Specifically, we provide an overview of typical machine learning applications in marketing and present a guiding framework. We position the articles in the Journal of Business Research's Special Issue on Machine Learning in Marketing within this framework and conclude by putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area.","Herhausen, D; Bernritter, SF; Ngai, EWT; Kumar, A; Delen, D",Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114254,Machine learning; Privacy; Algorithm; Marketing; Research agenda,5.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of machine learning in marketing, including its potential to transform decision-making processes and the need for a research agenda to guide future studies.

"Over the past few decades research has predominantly focused on the technical aspects and theoretical challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the deluge of data and the increase in processing power, businesses are now facing the challenge of how to deploy AI that generates business value. In this direction, there is still nascent research on how AI can be leveraged in for B2B operations, and particularly marketing. To address this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm and specifically on the micro-foundations approach and builds on three selected case studies of large organizations in Norway that use AI for B2B marketing purposes. The study identifies a number of AI-specific micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities, essentially highlighting how organizations can use AI to manage B2B marketing operations in dynamic and uncertain environments.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands ready to impact all aspects of business, from optimizing operations to personalizing services and enhancing customer value. However, many organizations grapple with implementing AI solutions due to a lack of necessary infrastructure and mechanisms. In short, many companies are not adequately prepared to adopt AI. To make matters worse, the literature does not offer sufficient insights into this issue. To help address this issue, in this article, the authors explore what it means to become 'AI-ready.' Specifically, this study identifies the various dimensions of AI readiness through in-depth semi-structured interviews with top- and middle-level managers from 52 multinational corporations in Southeast Asia, primarily in India. This study employed a qualitative data analysis approach to construct a grounded theory model focusing on AI readiness. The methodology involved systematic examination and coding of data to identify key themes and patterns, enabling the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework. The findings suggest that AI readiness can be categorized into eight dimensions: informational, environmental, infrastructural, participants, process, customers, data, and technological readiness.

"Organizations have cultural-cognitive and regulative as well as normative elements that impact their employees. Organizations, by definition, cannot achieve a pure, stable state and always go through various change processes, both incremental and radical changes. Moving from legacy business-to-business (B2B) relationship management to an artificial intelligence-based customer relationship management (AI-CRM) is a gradual but paradigm change. AI-CRM leverages intelligent systems to automate the B2B relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention. Relationship management in the B2B segment is considered a strategic activity of an organization. Moving from legacy to AI-CRM to facilitate B2B relationship management activities is an important decision, and proper implementation of AI-CRM is a critical success parameter for an organization.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial marketing has seen significant research attention through various theoretical lenses with an emerging thread examining the dark side effects of AI. Thirty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with buyers and suppliers of AI marketing solutions to investigate the consequences of AI 'dark forces' on B2B relationships. We posit AI as a new actor that has blurred the lines of the actors-resourcesactivities model. Findings show AI is now considered a new actor within B2B networks wielding dark force consequences such as algorithmic gatekeeping, which initiates dehumanization effects. In addition, AI is reliant on access to datasets which drives up resource costs. A lack of accountability of AI marketing solutions leads to opportunistic behaviours compromising actor relationships.

"This quantitative research study explores the impact of live marketing on consumers' irrational consumption behavior within the context of the new economic era. Adopting a structured approach, data were collected from 236 consumers through structured questionnaires utilizing Likert scale responses. Simple random sampling ensured a statistically representative sample across diverse demographics. The questionnaires comprehensively addressed various dimensions including exposure to live marketing events, emotional engagement, social media influencer impact, cognitive dissonance, socioeconomic factors, innovative marketing technologies, and irrational consumption behaviors. The data analysis was conducted meticulously utilizing SPSS and SmartPLS, involving various statistical techniques like summary statistics, correlation study, validation of factor analysis, and structural equation modeling, as well as comparative, moderation, and mediation analyses. The study uncovers novel insights, particularly highlighting the role of social media influencers in live marketing, elucidating how their involvement significantly amplifies the impact of social influence on consumers' irrational consumption decisions. Furthermore, findings reveal that consumers perceiving live marketing as immersive and memorable are more inclined towards engaging in irrational consumption behaviors. Additionally, the adoption of innovative live marketing technologies emerges as a key driver of brand perception, consequently leading to heightened levels of irrational consumption behaviors.

"Sustainability is at the top of the agenda of most tech companies. Specifically, tech companies increasingly utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to meet their sustainability goals. However, little is known about how tech companies can leverage AI to accelerate sustainability by formulating and implementing appropriate strategies. To better understand the intertwined nature of AI and sustainability from a strategy perspective, this research conceptually develops a novel AI x Sustainability framework by drawing from the nested sustainability model and integrating insights from different literature streams. It then applies this framework to six leading Big Tech companies (i.e., Amazon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, and SAP) by conducting a comprehensive document analysis of 69 documents describing 244 individual AI x Sustainability initiatives to reveal whether and how these companies appear to follow specific AI x Sustainability strategies. Lastly, an exploratory survey with potential tech companies' clients ( N = 192) sheds light on how clients perceive tech companies' communicated strategic positioning based on the framework.

"Literature on brand deletion (BD), a critical and topical decision within a firm's marketing strategy, is extremely scarce. The present research is concerned with the decision making process and examines the effect on BD success of three different approaches to decision making - rational, intuitive and political - and of the interaction between the rational and political approaches. The moderating effect of the type of BD - i.e., total brand killing or disposal vs. brand name change - is also analyzed. The model is tested on a sample of 155 cases of BD. Results point to positive effects on BD success of both rationality and intuition, and a negative effect of politics. Findings also indicate that the negative impact of political behavior on BD success is minimized in the absence of evidence and objective information and when the BD is undertaken through a brand name change.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proved its significance in every field and is yet to be explored in the banking sector in India. The study aims to understand the customers' perception of using AI-based technologies in banks. Satisfaction is the first step towards acceptability and retention of customers towards lesser-known technology and automated process implemented in banks. The constructs of the study are referred from the technology acceptance model to define their level of acceptance and are divided into independent and dependent variables. The independent variables are transparency, awareness level, security, efficiency, trust, and social influence, and the dependent variable is customer satisfaction. Therefore, the structural equation model was developed from the customers' (N = 500) response to retail banks in northern India. The study reveals that trust is the most significant factor for greater customers' satisfaction towards AI-enabled technologies in banks, followed by the customers' awareness level. The security of AI-based banks is the least important contributor to customer satisfaction. Additionally, the control variables, i.e., age and gender, govern the customers' perception. Understanding customer acceptability towards AI-based technology in retail banks is rare in emerging nations such as India. The findings provide insight into the formulation of compliance.

"The research note discusses the potential effects of contemporary technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), in enhancing consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews in the tourism and hospitality context. The study postulates that three characteristics of blockchain - decentralization, immutability, and timestamping - ensure transparency in the online review process. Using a socio-technical systems approach, the current study provides insights into how blockchain technology, AI agents, and human factors interact to facilitate such transparency and thereby enhance consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews for their decision-making. Therefore, the study proposes that perceived transparency mediates the relationship between these three blockchain characteristics and the trustworthiness of online reviews. In proposing an investigation of the characteristics of blockchain and its interaction with AI in online reviews, the study highlights that researchers and practitioners pay attention to a specific characteristic of contemporary technologies to actualize potential benefits.","Rajaguru, R",Strategic,10.1080/19368623.2023.2258522,Blockchain; artificial intelligence; online review; trustworthiness; transparency; socio-technical system,20.0,,5,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The research note discusses the long-term implications of blockchain and AI technologies on consumer trust in online reviews within the tourism and hospitality sector, aligning with strategic planning and decision-making processes.",wos-ai,60,15,"Effects of contemporary technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews",2024
"This study contributes to the extant literature by empirically investigating the influence of Business-to-Business (B2B) firms' technology readiness on information technology capability and artificial intelligence-based customer relationship management (AI-CRM) and finally, on relationship performance and social sustainabil-ity performance. We leverage primary data from 217 samples and examine the firm's social sustainability per-formance. Drawing on the paradigm of dynamic capability view, we found that a B2B firm's technology readiness has a positive relationship with information and communication technology and AI-CRM capability. Information and communication technology capability also has a positive and significant relationship with AI-CRM capa-bility. B2B firms' relationship performance has a significant and positive relationship with social sustainability performance. A key finding of this study is that a B2B firm's information and communication technology capability mediates between technology readiness and AI-CRM capability.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an important foundation of competitive advantage in the market for firms. As such, firms use AI to achieve deep market engagement when the firm's data are employed to make informed decisions. This study examines the role of computer-mediated AI agents in detecting crises related to events in a firm. A crisis threatens organizational performance; therefore, a data-driven strategy will result in an efficient and timely reflection, which increases the success of crisis management. The study extends the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) and Attribution theory frameworks built on big data and machine learning capabilities for early detection of crises in the market. This research proposes a structural model composed of a statistical and sentimental big data analytics approach. The findings of our empirical research suggest that knowledge extracted from day-to-day data communications such as email communications of a firm can lead to the sensing of critical events related to business activities. To test our model, we use a publicly available dataset containing 517,401 items belonging to 150 users, mostly senior managers of Enron during 1999 through the 2001 crisis. The findings suggest that the model is plausible in the early detection of Enron's critical events, which can support decision making in the market.","Farrokhi, A; Shirazi, F; Hajli, N; Tajvidi, M",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.09.015,Big data; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Data mining; Sentiment analytics,5.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the use of AI for crisis management and decision-making in firms, indicating long-term organizational goals and a data-driven strategy, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-ai,70,20,Using artificial intelligence to detect crisis related to events: Decision making in B2B by artificial intelligence,2020
"Firms are increasingly turning towards new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and drones, among others, to assist in interacting with their customers. Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.

"Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether order and scale of market entry influence a new product's market and financial performance, and how marketing and R&D resources strengthen or weaken these effects. Design/methodology/approach - Through a mail survey, data were collected on a sample of 136 product launches by Spanish manufacturing firms. A moderated hierarchical regression analysis enabled the assessment of the relevance of order and scale as well as their interactions with marketing and R&D resources to explain a product's competitive position. Moreover, a mediation analysis allowed us to determine whether market entry strategy (indirectly) affects financial performance. Findings - The analyses show that pioneering firms and those entering the market with a full-scale launch achieve advantages in terms of competitive position, and that this variable mediates the relationship of order and scale with profitability. The empirical results also reveal that such advantages are conditioned by the availability of marketing and R&D resources. Practical implications - The decisions regarding order and scale of market entry are contingent. Managers involved in the planning of a new product launch should be knowledgeable about their firm's resources and capabilities before determining when and how to enter the market. Originality/value - Many papers study the effects of order-of-entry on market share, but other dimensions of a new product launch strategy, such as scale, have largely been ignored. The research examines the effects of both variables on competitive position and profitability. This is also one of the first studies that explores the moderating effect exerted by resources and capabilities in the launch strategy-performance relationship.","Rodríguez-Pinto, J; Gutiérrez-Cillán, J; Rodríguez-Escudero, AI",Strategic,10.1108/03090560710737633,market entry; new products; competitive strategy; profit; Spain,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,"The paper discusses the long-term implications of market entry strategies on competitive position and financial performance, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making at the organizational level.",wos-ai,60,25,"Order and scale of market entry, firm resources, and performance",2007

"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to uncover morality and dynamics of community of incentivized reviewers who primarily review products on Amazon.com. and, as of late, on various social media platforms. This study is important because it uncovers unknown dynamics that shapes consumer morality and drives reviewer's ethics. Given the fact that consumers heavily rely on reviews, findings of this paper are of great values to practitioners, consumers and policymakers and highlight potential area of research particularly related to morality. Design/methodology/approach This study, conducted over a period of 1.5 years, relying on a netnography to collect data and thematic analysis to make sense of data, uncovered behaviors that contribute to the J-shape distribution of reviews on Amazon.com and questionable reviewer ethics. Findings Findings of this study suggest suppressed consumer morality driven by desire to gain benefits in form of free products and manipulation of the review system in an attempt to boost sales and the prevalence of biased reviews. The findings shed light on overconsumption driven by an opportunity to receive free products, introduction of review bias into the public domain and attempts to manipulate Amazon's algorithms. Research limitations/implications Findings of this study carry tremendous implications for average consumer who relies on consumer-generated reviews without realizing the presence of bias. Furthermore, the findings shed light of unfair business practices of sellers who demand high ratings. Finally, the findings suggest that there is opportunity for policymakers to address a loophole because incentivized reviewers, regardless of Federal Trade Commission regulations, may be operating in gray area, much less controlled than advertising. Originality/value This study is unique because while other studies may conduct similar netnographies of reviewing communities, this community was examined during a span that covered the incentivized reviewing boom, Amazon's ban on incentivized reviewing, and the revival of reviewing activity post ban. Given recent changes to Amazon's Terms of Service, the researcher documented changes that future studies will not be able to examine unless data have already been collected. However, post ban activity continues and is likely affecting purchasing decisions of unsuspecting consumers all around.","Rynarzewska, AI",Strategic,10.1108/JCM-02-2018-2570,Consumer behaviour; Decision-making; Trust; Consumer-generated reviews; Incetivized reviews,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study uncovers dynamics that influence consumer morality and reviewer ethics, which are crucial for long-term implications on marketing practices, consumer trust, and regulatory considerations.",wos-ai,60,20,"It's not fake, it's biased: insights into morality of incentivized reviewers",2019
"Although brand deletion (BD) is a key strategic decision within brand portfolio management, it has received very little attention in the scientific literature. This research expands the knowledge base on the BD strategy, particularly in the execution phase. Based on the literature addressing strategic change and marketing strategy implementation, this study explores the main and interaction effects of context (decentralization and consensus) and process (formalization and communication) implementation factors on the success of BD, measured in terms of its contribution to the firm's economic performance. Using a representative sample of 155 cases of BD, we show that the four factors are related to BD performance, although these relations are complex and intertwined. Consensus, communication, and decentralization positively affect BD performance, with consensus being particularly influential. Formalization is found to be a double-edged sword as the effects of formalizing the execution of the deletion are particularly convoluted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"In today's fiercely competitive business landscape, startups face numerous challenges in achieving scalability and sustainability. The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents promising solutions to these challenges. However, understanding the intricacies of technology acceptance within the startup environment becomes paramount. Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) have long served as foundational frameworks for understanding technology adoption and integration, but their effectiveness is hindered by inherent limitations. These limitations demand further exploration, particularly when viewed through the entrepreneurial lens. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations inherent in TAM and its extensions, alongside other prominent technology acceptance models. By incorporating an entrepreneurial perspective, the analysis reveals additional challenges stemming from the dynamic nature of startup ecosystems. From a pragmatic standpoint, this paper provides actionable insights for technology-driven entrepreneurial organizations to navigate innovation and technology adoption decisions more intelligently. From a theoretical perspective, it contributes to the refinement and evolution of technology acceptance models, particularly in the context of entrepreneurial ventures. In light of these limitations, the paper offers strategic recommendations for future research endeavors. These include encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, contextualizing models to suit startup dynamics, conducting longitudinal studies to capture evolving user perceptions, accounting for individual differences in technology adoption, and validating emerging models to reflect contemporary realities. Emphasis is placed on the entrepreneurial imperative of agility and adaptability in navigating the ever-changing landscape of technology acceptance. Moreover, the paper underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and delineates practical implications for organizations and practitioners aiming to sustain technology acceptance and successful implementation within dynamic startup environments. By addressing these constraints, researchers can pave the way for the development of more robust and comprehensive models, better equipped to clarify and predict technology acceptance and usage patterns. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical need for ongoing refinement and innovation within the realm of technology acceptance, providing actionable insights to propel both scholarly discourse and entrepreneurial practice forward.","Rahimi, RA; Oh, GS",Strategic,10.1057/s41270-024-00318-x,Technology acceptance model; Entrepreneurship; Limitations; Startup environment; Innovation adoption,10.0,,5,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of technology acceptance models (TAMs) in the context of startups, focusing on the need for refinement and innovation to support strategic organizational goals in a dynamic environment.",wos-ai,70,15,Beyond theory: a systematic review of strengths and limitations in technology acceptance models through an entrepreneurial lens,2024
"Purpose The decision concerning the degree of product and service customization is crucial, yet has scarcely been studied for small businesses in business-to-business (B2B) contexts. Although such a decision allows relationships with potential customers to be strengthened, it might involve high opportunity costs given the investment required. This paper aims to analyse the profitability of customization undertaken by small businesses in terms of cost-benefit and examine the drivers of profitable customized projects vis-a-vis the ability to strengthen relationships with clients (relationship investment and customer involvement) and the firm's resources related to processes and technology (expertise and modularity). Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected from 140 small Spanish firms involved in two sectors characterized by the offer of customized solutions: information and professional, scientific and technical services. Findings Analysis reveals that customer involvement in the customized solution, even when it requires investing in equipment, time or human resources has a positive effect on customization and ultimately on profitability, as the cost of this customer interaction is lower than the revenue it provides. Likewise, supplier investment in the relationship allows for a solution that is adapted to the client, although it requires a cost associated with investing in specific assets. Such costs cancel out the positive indirect effect through the customized solution. Finally, expertise enables appropriate use of the flexibility derived from modularity to satisfy customer requirements, with both being key company resources for driving profitability through customized solutions. Originality/value This study makes a contribution to the domain of customization. The authors extend current knowledge on B2B customization by proving that small firms can use their available capabilities and knowledge to achieve a successful customization strategy.","Rodríguez-Escudero, AI; Camarero-Izquierdo, C; Redondo-Carretero, M",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-03-2021-0147,Customization; Small businesses; Relationship investment; Expertise; Modularity,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of customization decisions in small businesses and their impact on profitability and customer relationships, which aligns with strategic planning and goals.",wos-ai,60,25,"Towards profitable customized solutions in small firms: a matter of relationships, modularity and expertise",2023

"Purpose This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework based on transaction cost economics that identifies key factors shaping public agencies' governance of supplier relationships and related performance implications. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents an extended transaction cost framework for research on public procurement (PP) with a corresponding set of propositions. Transaction cost theory and specific features of and challenges to the PP function identified in extant literature constitute the main elements of the framework. Findings This conceptual paper makes three sets of proposals. First, public agencies tend to rely on market governance of supplier relationships and when PP deploys non-market governance, such governance tends to be of a unilateral (vs bilateral) kind. Second, increases in purchasing competence and autonomy of PP and particularly if implemented in tandem, will reduce PP's overreliance on market governance and increase PP's use of non-market governance. Third, PP should perform better for less complex transactions - and when contracting complexity relates to safeguarding of specific assets rather than when complexity relates to environmental and behavioral uncertainty. Increases in competence and autonomy should increase PP's performance, particularly for complex transactions. Practical implications Public agencies may be in a better position to align governance solutions with transaction complexities by developing their procurement competence, decentralizing procurement decisions and increasing the flexibility of national and international procurement regulations. Private companies selling to public agencies need to be aware of and able to adapt to PP practices such as extensive use of market governance and unilateral governance as the primary form of non-market governance. Social implications The paper discusses how public agencies can improve procurement performance through better alignment of governance of supplier relationships with transaction attributes and thereby increase the quality of public services. Originality/value The paper relies on a well-established theoretical perspective, enabling identification (and, potentially, correction) of governance misalignment in the public sector.","Rokkan, AI; Haugland, SA",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-09-2019-0393,Public sector; Governance; Procurement; Transaction costs,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper develops a theoretical framework that aims to improve public procurement governance and performance, addressing long-term implications and aligning governance solutions with transaction complexities, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-ai,65,20,A transaction cost approach for public procurement,2022
"Purpose: The analysis of the content of publications concerning decision-making processes in an enterprise indicates that one of the tasks of modern management is to identify effective solutions based on the synergy of human and technological resources that support decision-making processes. This also applies to marketing, which is subject to virtualization related both to its concept and instruments, as well as marketing activities. The purpose of the paper is to show the role of artificial intelligence and human talent in decision making in the field of marketing in an enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: Critical literature review; the research procedure that is based on the review of the literature is focused on formulating the answers to the following questions: - What factors determine the effective implementation of artificial intelligence as a technology supporting decision-making processes in the sphere of marketing in enterprises? - What are the identified models of application of artificial intelligence and human talent in making decisions in enterprises? Findings: The use of the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence in supporting marketing decisions brings many benefits, but it also requires overcoming mental and cultural barriers. It should be emphasized that relying on artificial intelligence in decision-making processes does not mean eliminating people, especially the talented ones, because it is the employee who can revise the decision-making criteria or state that the algorithm on the basis of which decisions are made in the company is outdated. Research limitations/implications: Empirical verification of the proposed model would allow for identifying the role performed by talented employees and algorithms in decision-making processes in the era of development of innovative IT solutions along with determination of the hierarchy of factors stimulating these processes.

Changes in the nature of interpersonal communication predetermined by the limited personal activity and the introduction of remote forms of interaction, have generated demand for innovative ways of communication with customers. Other factors that require the adjustment of marketing strategies include the emergence of new behavioral capabilities of consumers associated with the intensive development of digital communication channels. It has been noted that in the digital communication environment, digital platforms provide the main format of communication with the existing customer base and potential customers. In addition, prompt acquisition and processing of data on purchasing behavior of customers allows companies to increase significantly the sensitivity of marketing research and optimize their own marketing decisions. Among the areas of increasing targeting and personalization of product offerings, the use of elements of artificial intelligence and voice search has been accentuated. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence greatly facilitates and simplifies the work of marketers on the processing and initial analysis of the growing flow of digital marketing data, as well as provides greater efficiency. It has been concluded that widespread use of voice assistants in e-commerce requires companies to rethink radically their approaches to internal data processing, IT investment and customer engagement strategies. Active integration of chatbots into various communication platforms is able to make them universal tools for both business and consumers, which will allow them to become a familiar part of the user experience. Implementation of virtual reality and augmented reality elements in the interface of company websites can significantly diversify the process of collecting information by users and push them to unplanned purchases. It has been indicated that the growing standards of personalization and new rules of customer confidentiality will continue to require companies to be flexible and introduce new technologies in order to adapt permanently their business to new conditions. Focusing on building trust with customers based on digital communications will enable companies to create a long-term integrated marketing strategy and concentrate on the multi-channel nature of customer experience.","Hnoievyi, VH; Koren, OM",Strategic,10.32342/2074-5354-2021-1-54-5,marketing strategy; digital marketing; innovations; personalization; digital channels; artificial intelligence; voice search; virtual reality; augmented reality,5.0,,10,0,ALFRED NOBEL UNIV,The abstract discusses the need for companies to rethink their marketing strategies and adapt to changes in customer communication and behavior.

"Cognitive computing is ushering in the fourth industrial revolution through its promises of improved accuracy, scalability and personalisation. Therefore, business-to-business (B2B) organisations are wavering in the decision for adoption into their digital marketing initiatives. However, embracing moral rules and/or moral judgments in their digital marketing innovation can be challenging, since making mistakes could damage reputations. Therefore, this study applies the ethical principles of cognitive computing in B2B digital marketing business-centric ethical challenges. An integrated theoretical framework grounded on multidisciplinary studies is proposed. The primary data were collected from 300 respondents within B2B businesses. The results of this research led to the conclusion that good ethical practices are essential for the improvement of both organisational effectiveness and organisational reputation. Increased organisational reputation delivers a competitive edge in fast-growing marketplaces.

"While organizational frontlines in the digital age involve complex interactions between consumers, autonomous technology (AT), and frontline workers, research so far largely focuses on the effect of AT on either the consumer or the worker. Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer-Autonomous Technology-Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer-worker-AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as ATenabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer-worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers' and workers' acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker.","van Doorn, J; Smailhodzic, E; Puntoni, S; Li, J; Schumann, JH; Holthöwer, J",Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114000,Human-machine collaboration; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Service; Robots,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the development of a framework (CAW) that reflects long-term implications for consumer-worker-AT interactions, indicating a focus on overarching goals and future research directions in marketing and organizational behavior.",wos-artificial intelligence,60,25,Organizational frontlines in the digital age: The Consumer-Autonomous Technology-Worker (CAW) framework,2023
"In the current phase of artificial intelligence development, more and more attention is being paid to technologies that make autonomous decisions. Little attention has been paid to the customers' and job seekers' perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers' attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers' intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital's unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies. The topic is worth exploring as key market players (such as Oracle) recognize autonomous technologies as the most ground-breaking innovation that will shape business in the coming years.","Modlinski, A",Strategic,10.30924/mjcmi.29.1.5,autonomous systems; intelligent technologies; marketing; innovation; employer branding; customer behavior,5.0,,15,0,"UNIV SPLIT, FAC ECONOMICS","The research addresses long-term implications of autonomous decision-making technologies on customer and job seeker perceptions, aligning with strategic planning in marketing.",wos-artificial intelligence,60,20,TO BOAST OR NOT TO BOAST: THE IMPACT OF ADVERTISING THE USE OF AUTONOMOUS ALGORITHMS TO BANK AND HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES,2024
"In a very open competitive context where pure online players are consistently gaining market share, the use of digital devices is a steady trend which is penetrating physical retail stores as a tool for retailers to improve customer experience and increase engagement. This need has increased with the COVID-19 pandemic as electronic devices in physical stores reduce the contact between people providing a greater sense of health safety, hence improving the customer experience. This work develops a multiple-criteria decision-making model for retailers who want to digitize their physical stores, providing a systematic approach to manage investment priorities in the organization. Important decisions should involve all different areas of the organization: Finance, Clients, Internal Processes and Learning & Growth departments. This strategic decision can be made hierarchically to obtain consistent decisions, also the use of the Order Weighted Average operator allows for alternative scenarios to be presented and agreed among the different areas of the business. The authors develop a use case for a Spanish fashion retailer. In the most widely agreed scenario the preferred devices were more technologically complex and expensive, while in the scenarios where the head of Finance is more predominant, cheaper and simpler devices were selected.","Llorens, M; Carrasco, R; Bueno, I; Herrera-Viedma, E; Morente-Molinera, JA",Strategic,10.3846/tede.2022.16553,store digitization; multiple-criteria decision making; customer experience; in-store technology; interactive marketing; retail,5.0,,10,0,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,"The content discusses a multiple-criteria decision-making model aimed at helping retailers digitize their physical stores, which aligns with long-term organizational planning and investment priorities.",wos-artificial intelligence,60,25,MULTIPLE CRITERIA APPROACH APPLIED TO DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN FASHION STORES: THE CASE OF PHYSICAL RETAILERS IN SPAIN,2022
"PurposeThe next generation of mobility is arising, and various challenging mobilities have entered the limelight. One of the most exciting of these is urban air mobility (UAM), and one of its challenges is constructing effective and efficient UAM service network. This study took a quantitative approach to the problem in an effort to support and facilitate the UAM service industry.Design/methodology/approachThis study derived a multi-objective and multi-period (MOMP) location optimization model to support strategic UAM service network design. The model, based on its long-term service plan, determines where and when to open UAM airports. In addition, this study applied a modified e-constraint algorithm to derive managerial decisions on the Pareto relationship in consideration of multiple objectives and multiple periods.FindingsEach Pareto solution represents a different UAM service network configuration. Thus, the model can analyze the trade-offs between Pareto decisions for the UAM service network. A case study of UAM service network design in South Korea demonstrates the validity of the proposed mathematical model and algorithm.Practical implicationsThe design of a UAM service network should consider various aspects. Its construction and operation would require significant investments of time, capital and people, which would redound to society over a significant span of time. The results of this study provide quantitative guidelines for derivation and analysis of various UAM service network configurations in consideration of multiple objectives and multiple periods.Originality/valueThis paper proposes MOMP optimization, which approach is suitable to the fundamental characteristics of expanding UAM service networks and their design.

"The development of technology is changing and transforming business models in the production and service sectors around the world. Especially in this age when the fourth industrial revolution is effective with different instruments such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, and cyber physical systems, the necessity of physical presence of people in the workplaces is gradually decreasing. Like many things developed in the virtual world, the virtual arrangement of workplaces is a very innovative undertaking. It is clear that the advantage of time and cost are the main reasons for the positive reception of the idea of workplace design in the metaverse environment. In this article, the criteria for workplace design in the metaverse environment of a company operating in the IT sector were examined and alternative metaverse platforms for workplace design using these criteria were evaluated.

"In the field of business-to-business marketing, corporate ethical identity and corporate brand identity are crucial subjects for discussion. Business organizations function under social norms, and to establish an ethical identity, they must show corporate ethical responsibility, embrace ethical standards, and maintain open communication with suppliers. While an organization's reputation is impacted by the absence of an ethical identity, its financial success is unaffected. Extant literature has not thrown a spotlight on social and environmental performance which indicates that less focus has been given by academics than by practitioners. To fill the lacuna in the existing literature, this study examines the relationships between corporate ethical identity, corporate brand identity, social and environmental performance. The study uses a deductive research approach and develops hypotheses which are further tested using variance based structural equation modeling. The study offers a distinctive contribution to ethics theory and stakeholder theory by showing that developing an ethical identity requires more than just adhering to moral guidelines and upholding open communication. Companies must show that they are ethically responsible towards society. The study provides evidence of the influence corporate brand identity has on environmental and social performance.

"The rapid development of science has ushered the society into the era of the digital economy, profoundly altering the habits and behaviors of empowered digital citizens. This transformation is particularly evident in the financial sector, where Internet companies have spearheaded the growth of Internet finance, offering non-professional, highly autonomous, cost-effective, and accessible financial services. Traditional banks face stiff competition from internal and cross-border rivals, compelling them to embark on digital transformation journeys to stay relevant. This research paper delves into the critical relationship between technology forecasting and social change, exploring the impact of gender imbalances on FinTech innovation. It also examines innovative e-commerce marketing models driven by big data and artificial intelligence, catalyzing advancements in the financial field. The digitalization of banks encompasses multiple facets, including decision-making, ecosystem development, channel optimization, process enhancement, data center construction, and infrastructure fortification. Central to this transformation is the understanding of customer emotions, a task made more intelligent through natural language processing (NLP) technology. We employ NLP techniques to analyze customer voice data and discern emotional states, including one-hot vector representation and Word2Vector models, alongside Bi-LSTM and attention processes. This approach significantly enhances our ability to tailor policies and products in real time, ensuring a more personalized customer experience. Also, the paper emphasizes the importance of establishing robust data governance systems, innovating talent development mechanisms, controlling digital risks, and optimizing customer acquisition strategies in the digital transformation journey. It also addresses the changing landscape of e-commerce architecture, highlighting the significance of logistical expertise and security considerations in international Internet sales.

"PurposeThis paper aims to explore the challenges and opportunities faced by buying centers in small and medium enterprises (SME) manufacturing companies in view of recent technological changes and the virtualization of communication.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a qualitative approach with multiple case studies to portray complex realities within the buying centers in the manufacturing SME context. The authors selected five Italian companies to portray the diverse characteristics, practices and policies of relevant stakeholders before reaching saturation with the issues explored.FindingsThe authors find that interactions among buying center members are more effective with greater collaboration and exchange (as opposed to competition and a struggle for power). Virtual/hybrid relations require greater intra-group cooperation, whereas diverse backgrounds and collaborative interactions help the flexibility and performance of the buying center. Greater use of technology produces certainty and automation, but it may also cause overload and biases that can be solved with the ability to analyze and clear responsibility for decisions.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors studied only five Italian companies in this study. Future research in other countries with diverse cultural and socio-economic conditions and methods would help extend this research.Practical implicationsThe findings would improve the understanding of the challenges of adopting new purchase process technologies that would help automate routine tasks, produce useful data and support decision-making.Originality/valueUnlike prior studies, this study uses an exploratory design to study the evolution of buying centers in SMEs to seek deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by SMEs because of the growing use of emerging technologies.","Cardinali, S; Sharma, P; Cedrola, E; Giovannetti, M; Pillai, KG",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-03-2023-0157,Buying center; Digital communication; Digital technologies; Hybrid selling,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term challenges and opportunities faced by buying centers in SMEs, including the implications of technological changes and the evolution of communication.

"PurposeAmid challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, fostering employee creativity has become paramount for organizations. However, there is a scarcity of research on digitalization of the workplace and its implications for implementing high involvement work systems (HIWSs) in organizations, particularly in relation to their impact on employee outcomes, such as creativity and job satisfaction. Additionally, limited attention has been given to the role of job level and organizational type in driving change during times of adversity. This study aims to examine the factors within the HIWSs model using the PIRK model - power (P), information sharing (I), rewards (R) and knowledge (K) to explore how HIWSs shape the extent of power individuals have over their employment, the sharing of information, the types of rewards that engage and motivate employees and the knowledge required to fulfil employees' responsibilities effectively, both individually and collectively.Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative research methodology, this study uses thematic analysis for data collection, analysis and interpretation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 48) served as the primary data collection method. Using the theoretical lenses of high-involvement practices and employee perceptions of PIRK, the effect on employee creativity and job satisfaction is analysed.FindingsThe findings of this study reveal that employee creativity is significantly influenced by how employees perceive power, information, rewards and knowledge. Moreover, the study highlights the role of transformational and transactional leadership in shaping employee perceptions of power, information and knowledge within HIWSs. A high perception of PIRK is found to positively impact employee job satisfaction.Research limitations/implicationsThis study offers valuable insights for human resource management (HRM) professionals seeking to make informed decisions regarding best practices and initiatives for enhancing employee outcomes in the post-COVID era. By recognizing the pivotal role of HIWSs and their influence on employee perceptions, organizations can strategically implement HIWSs to foster creativity and job satisfaction. Furthermore, this research contributes to the existing literature by examining the interplay between HIWSs and the PIRK model in the context of workplace digitalization, emphasizing the importance of adapting HRM practices to address the evolving needs of the modern workforce.Originality/valueThis study will help HRM professionals in making informed decisions on the best practices and initiatives to enhance employee outcomes in the post-COVID era.

"Sharing economy is flourishing and increasingly customers are shifting towards using instead of owning products and services. The objective of our research is to empirically prove that low organizational trust can trigger strict organizational practices such as ethics training and audits but excessive use of both of these practices can negatively impact the relationship quality in sharing economy. In doing so, it has detrimental effects on co-creation and co-innovation particularly when the goals are related to emotional cognitive, material support and relationship building. This study, therefore, targets to scrutinize the dark side of B2B sharing economy platforms using the ethical theory of organizing. The unique contribution of this study is first, showcasing the relationships between ethical climate, ethical practices and consequences. Second, it highlights that B2B alliances that perceive strictness in ethics audits have a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. However, the effect of strictness in ethics training does not lead to the development of a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. This is an interesting finding and generates a theoretical debate.

"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.","Rust, RT; Huang, MH",Strategic,10.1509/jm.10.0441,service productivity; financial impact; marketing metrics; self-service; customer satisfaction; service quality; technology,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the management of service productivity as a strategic decision variable aimed at maximizing profits, indicating long-term planning and goals for service companies.",wos-automation,70,15,Optimizing Service Productivity,2012
"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers. Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems, and other issues.","Kalaignanam, K; Varadarajan, R",Strategic,10.1007/s11747-011-0291-0,Offshore outsourcing; Cross-border outsourcing; Offshoring; Customer relationship management; Global marketing; International marketing,5.0,,10,5,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of CRM offshore outsourcing, its antecedents, consequences, and broader managerial considerations, indicating a focus on strategic planning and decision-making.",wos-automation,60,20,Offshore outsourcing of customer relationship management: conceptual model and propositions,2012
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify factors influencing firm adoption of internet banking services (IBS). While previous literature has primarily focussed on the individual consumers' adoption, the authors aim to shed light on the adoption of online banking by firms. The authors investigate the propensity and speed of IBS adoption and offer recommendations to providers of IBS and firm users. Design/methodology/approach - To attain the above purpose a conceptual model was based on research about IBS adoption in the firm context that derives primarily from technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovation. The authors use data from 5,002 firms located in 239 counties, encompassing 52.1 percent of firms users of IBS of a financial service provider and 47.9 percent of non-user firms. All sampled firms received an offer to adopt IBS from the financial service provider. Such unique data set was analyzed using logistic regression to assess propensity and a survival analysis model to assess IBS adoption speed. Findings - Results revealed that firms, with high propensity to adopt IBS, operate with a diverse management board, are large and young, and compete with a large number of firm users. The survival model showed that the diverse composition of management board also speeds up IBS adoption. Practical implications - Several implications are drawn from the findings. For instance, managers in firms adopting IBS should invest in recruiting and retaining a diverse set of board members (e. g. internal and external with full decision power), which allows for thorough assessment of pros and cons of any relevant decision to be made. The authors also highlight implications for managers in financial service providers (e. g. bank) that offer IBS to automate the relationship with customer firms. Managers should consider the study as a template for the selection criteria of firms that are likely to accept the IBS offer. Originality/value - This is one of few empirical studies to investigate the adoption of IBS in a firm context. Previous studies focussed on the individual consumer adoption of IBS. The authors show that adopting diverse set of board management, growing in size, young firms and facing the competitive environment positively influence firm's propensity to adopt IBS. The authors also analyze the time spent by firms from the IBS offering to the adoption, which shows that management decision context play a key role in adoption speed. The research contributions add to the scarce ongoing discussion about firm's adoption of IBS.","Claro, DP; Rosa, RB",Strategic,10.1108/MIP-11-2015-0226,B2B relationship; Firm technology adoption; Internet banking service; Relationship automation,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses factors influencing firm adoption of internet banking services, which relates to long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.

"The concept of justification and evaluation of systems, projects, and technologies has traditionally fallen within the scope of internal enterprise decision-making. Yet, with the growth of inter-organizational projects, technologies, and programs, the evaluation process takes on a broader and more complex characteristic. Previously, strategic justification and selection focused on internal departments within an organization and meeting their requirements. Within this context the decision was usually tied to strategic goals and directions of the firm, a common element for all departments. Even though the objectives and directions may have some minor conflicts among these various groups, the decision ultimately came down to one decision maker or group that had the best interests of that specific organization in mind. With inter-organizational systems, such as information systems used in managing the supply chain, the conflicts are between organizations that may have more than one supply chain that they are a part of, with varying strategic directions. The additional complexities of multiorganizational systems evaluation are evaluated within a framework described in this paper. The paper's goal is to introduce the various factors and present a decision framework that will aid members of the supply chain and a supply chain director in deciding which electronic commerce technology media and software is most suitable for the whole supply chain. The techniques used in this approach include both qualitative and quantitative measurements for the evaluation or justification of these systems. The framework uses an integrative set of models based on the analytical hierarchy process and goal programming.

"PurposeMarketing is all about understanding your consumers and giving them what they want. However, this process becomes more complicated in times of economic crisis and national slowdown. Consumers can become scattered and unpredictable in their behaviour, making it hard to understand what they want or need. At times like these, it is more important than ever to rely on qualitative market research to understand the views of consumers and managers. Thus, this study aims to look at the significant consumer challenges that arise during times of crisis and the marketing strategies that managers prefer to counter the crisis. Design/methodology/approachThe data collected for this study involves an extensive literature review followed by personal interviews with industry experts. This study presents two separate models, indicating hierarchical relationships among consumer challenges during crisis and marketing strategies using the total interpretive structural modelling approach. Further MICMAC analysis (popularly known as cross-impact matrix multiplication) was also performed to assess each variable's driving and dependence power. FindingsPrice sensitiveness and adaptive buying result as driving factors with the highest driving and lowest dependence power, which further gives rise to other consumer behaviour challenges. Likewise, the most critical strategies are information systems and the formation of crisis management teams during a crisis. At the same time, other strategies have resulted as linkage and dependent factors and none as the autonomous factor.

"Autonomous cars are considered to be the next disruptive innovation that will affect consumers. It can be expected that not only traditional automakers will enter this market (e.g., Ford) but also technology companies (e.g., Google) and newer companies dedicated to self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla). We take a brand extension perspective and analyze to what extent consumers prefer autonomous cars from these brand categories. Our empirical study is based on discrete choice experiments about adopting autonomous vehicles in a purchase scenario and in a renting context. Our findings show that brands play a central role when making autonomous driving decisions. Brand preferences differ systematically when buying versus renting a self-driving car. While technology brands are most preferred overall, consumers favor automaker brands over new brands only when purchasing, not when renting. We further disentangle the brand strength into the marginal effects of image associations. For example, Google's strong brand positioning can be explained by experiences with the parent brand, but it could still improve brand strength by highlighting the relevance of the associated brand portfolio for self-driving cars. The effect of these brand extension success factors differs between parent-brand categories and also between the renting and purchasing scenarios, which requires a dedicated brand management.","Eggers, F; Eggers, F",Strategic,10.1007/s11002-021-09571-x,Autonomous cars; Brand extension; Brand image; Innovations; Conjoint analysis,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of brand preferences in the autonomous car market, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics.",wos-autonomous,60,25,Drivers of autonomous vehicles-analyzing consumer preferences for self-driving car brand extensions,2022
"In this article, we explore consumers' perceptions of marketing and the extent to which they believe that marketing can play a positive transformative role in society. Findings from 36 semistructured interviews indicate that consumers typically perceive marketing as having a traditional short-term, transactional, and company-focused orientation rather than a transformative one. This was reflected in participants' views of marketing, as well as in their choices and comments when they were given two academic definitions of marketing and one description of unethical marketing and asked to choose the one they thought best described marketing. In addition, participants viewed marketing as manipulative, and most held one-sidedly negative opinions of its transformative potential. The majority did not feel autonomous in their purchase decisions, calling into question marketers' usual defence that consumers are sovereign. In a similar vein, they expressed concerns about the effects of marketing's manipulative and deceptive techniques on vulnerable consumers. These findings are rather worrying given that enhancing the transformative potential of marketing requires a more nuanced understanding of its role and function within society. Accordingly, we argue that successful transformative marketing interventions need to take into account and address consumers' disbelief as to the capacity of marketing to improve social welfare.

"As a mature tourism destination, the Balearic Islands suffer the normal effects of the stagnation stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC) model. During stagnation, reorientation policies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of those effects in order to reduce the prevalence of seasonality. Various planning instruments have been designed and implemented by successive local governments, a key priority being the attempt to find a strategic answer to reducing this phenomenon. Based on the analysis of successive marketing plans of the Autonomous Region of the Balearic Islands, and using the Gini index to measure seasonality, this study explores the link between the two and demonstrates that regional political policies adopted over the last 20 years have not reduced seasonal variation in tourism. The demand remains at the same levels of seasonality as in the 1990s, suggesting the ineffectiveness of the policies implemented.","Sastre, MAG; Hormaeche, MA; Villar, MT",Strategic,10.5367/te.2015.0519,seasonality; marketing plan; tourism destination; Balearic Islands,5.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"The abstract discusses long-term tourism policies and their effectiveness in addressing seasonal variation in the Balearic Islands, which aligns with strategic planning focused on long-term goals and organizational nature.",wos-autonomous,60,20,Are regional political decisions the key element in reducing seasonal variation in tourism?

"A paradigm shift in marketing seems to be underway. Inspired by Vargo and Lusch's (2004a) proposal of service dominant logic, customer integration is proposed as a key component of marketing. Three stages of service provision are identified: facilities, transformation. and usage. The stages differ in terms of resource origin (company or customer), autonomy of decision-making (integrative or autonomous), and value (potential value, value-in-transformation. and value-in-use). These perspectives, which are synthesized in the study framework, shed light on the process of service provision and direct or indirect knowledge application (Vargo and Lusch 2004a). The author aims to show that in the context of the proposed framework, customer integration is vital to the implementation of service provision.","Moeller, S",Strategic,10.1177/1094670508324677,customer integration; service dominant logic; marketing implementation; service provision,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses a paradigm shift in marketing and emphasizes the importance of customer integration within service provision, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",wos-autonomous,65,20,Customer Integration-A Key to an Implementation Perspective of Service Provision,2008

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to craft a future research agenda to advance smart service research and practice. Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach - This article is based on discussions in the workshop on Fresh perspectives on technology in service at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings - We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value - Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored. We provide a fresh perspective on service research by characterizing relevant aspects of smart service that will stimulate fruitful future research and advance the understanding and practice of smart services.","Wünderlich, NV; Heinonen, K; Ostrom, AL; Patricio, L; Sousa, R; Voss, C; Lemmink, JGAM",Strategic,10.1108/JSM-01-2015-0040,Connected services; Intelligent object; New service type; Smart services,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract outlines a future research agenda for smart service research, focusing on long-term implications and the foundational understanding of smart services in a marketing context.",wos-autonomous,60,20,Futurizing smart service: implications for service researchers and managers,2015
"Using self-determination theory, the authors explore whether destination appeal enhances intrinsic motivations to study abroad. Primary data gathered from inbound and outbound educational travellers in Paris, France were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling. It was confirmed that the mediating effect of destination appeal enhances intrinsic motivations for studying abroad. A discussion follows about how destinations can enhance educational travellers' autonomous decision-making through two self-contextual influences - information and external control. Destination authorities can potentially address a society-wide issue - the lesser performance of extrinsically motivated students.

"This paper analyzes, in the context of negotiation, the problem of coordination and conflict resolution between the manufacturer (Seller) and the retailers (Buyers) for a two-tier inventory system. The retailers capture demand (from customers) and therefore are responsible for the level of service offered by the system. The larger the inventory that a retailer has of a particular product, the lower the probability of running out of stock and therefore, avoid the possibility of a lost sale for the manufacturer. A conflict arises (and therefore the negotiation process starts) when the manufacturer wants the retailer to increase the level of service while retailers are satisfied with the status quo. Using the Nash bargaining solution, we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates behavioral dimensions and predicts the outcome of sharing the profit. The results indicate the advantage of developing long term relationships among the members of the distribution channel to minimize the uncertainty and therefore the source of conflict.","Ernst, R; López-Sánchez, JI; Urbano, D",Strategic,10.1007/s10726-008-9139-5,Negotiation; Marketing; Game theory; Operations; Collaborative seller-buyers,5.0,,5,0,SPRINGER,"The paper discusses long-term relationships and coordination in a two-tier inventory system, focusing on conflict resolution and negotiation strategies between manufacturers and retailers.

"Eco-innovations are increasingly manufactured and consumed across national borders. Although global outsourcing can be financially profitable, it is questionable whether consumers respond to eco-innovations manufactured in different countries in the same way. This article introduces the ecological country-of-manufacture (COM) concept, which reflects consumers' perception of a country's commitment to sustainable development policy and practices. Drawing on schema theory, the current research examines how consumer reactions to ecological (in)congruence-when the sustainability reputation of a COM is a (mis)match with product eco-friendliness levels-vary across product categories (Study 1a), consumption contexts (Study 1b), and national settings (Study 2). Consumers report more preferential evaluations when there is ecological incongruence for privately consumed products and ecological congruence for publicly consumed products. The results also demonstrate the differential moderating effects of socioeconomic development factors and cultural dimensions. In emerging markets with highly embedded, hierarchical, and high-harmony cultures, consumers require ecological congruence to justify their adoption decisions, whereas in developed markets with highly autonomous, egalitarian, and high-mastery cultures, consumers are more likely to adopt eco-innovations that are ecologically incongruent.","Tran, TTH; Paparoidamis, NG",Strategic,10.1177/1069031X20920869,adoption intentions; country of manufacture; eco-innovations; product eco-friendliness,5.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of consumer perceptions of eco-innovations based on the ecological country-of-manufacture concept, indicating a broad understanding of market dynamics and consumer behavior that aligns with strategic planning.",wos-autonomous,60,20,Eco-Innovations in Global Markets: The Effect of Ecological (In)Congruence on Consumers' Adoption Intentions,2020
"Over the past years, the business-to-customer online shopping market has grown rapidly and changed the business pattern. In order to differentiate themselves from competition, marketers have adopted e-business to provide superior service that satisfies consumers and ultimately create consumers' perceived value. The benefits of e-shopping also come with potential risks that the consumers must be aware of. One of the biggest challenges of e-stores is attracting enough online customers to be profitable and survive. That is why a shift in buying behaviour and attitude of consumers toward e-shopping is a key to success of e-stores. The present study focuses on identifying the key factors influencing consumers' perceived benefits and risks while shopping online. Further, the study presents the impact of perceived benefits and perceived risk on perceived value of e-shoppers.

"Currently, marketing is undergoing a major shift driven by environmental disruptions and advances in marketing technologies. This shift has implications for marketing decision-making. However, research on how marketing managers navigate modern marketing environments' complex, volatile, and data-intensive nature is limited. This study addresses this gap by qualitatively analyzing marketing managers' decision-making processes in 15 companies. Using the naturalistic decision-making approach and the situative perspective on cognition and action as theoretical lenses, we identify three key characteristics of decision-making in modern marketing environments-namely, agility, inventiveness, and reflexiveness.

"Purpose While big data (BD), a transformative emerging phenomenon on its youth, plays a growing role in organizations in improving marketing decision-making, few academic works examine the mechanism through which BD can be applied to guide future competitive advantage strategies. The purpose of this paper is to examine if BD's predictive power helps business to business (B2B) firms selecting their intended generic (differentiation, focus, and cost leadership) strategies. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the learning theory, the study proposes the use of BD as a key driver of intended strategies. Based on data from a cross-industry sample of executives, a conceptual model is tested using path and robustness analyses. Findings The use of BD plays a prominent role in the selection of intended future strategies in industrial markets. Additional tests demonstrate conditions of competitive intensity and strategic flexibility where BD is more and less beneficial. Originality/value The study reinforces the continued applicability of Porter's generic positioning strategies in the digital era.

The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN).FindingsThe findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development.Originality/valueThe manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations.

"According to the literature, companies that use consumer data from digital marketing can have better results than those that do not. However, investments in analytics have gradually declined and most research does not place the use of data in strategic processes. Thus, this paper proposes a model to evaluate the incorporation of external knowledge generated by data, with the organization's internal knowledge, through the insertion of the absorptive capacity as a mediator between the use of digital marketing data and the effectiveness of marketing decision-making. To this end, a survey of 144 Brazilian retail companies was conducted and it was found that there is mediation, but it is partial.

Design/methodology/approach The study used 418 questionnaires collected from firms that actively invest in marketing, advertising and communication in the Italian market. The hypotheses testing and analysis were conducted using structural equation modeling. Findings The results reveal that customers' data gathered from social media produce different effects on knowledge management practices and firms' innovation capacity. Furthermore, increased innovation capacity turned out to affect customer relationship performance directly, while it contributes to gain better financial performance only when it is used to gain relational outcomes. Originality/value The outcomes of the study help firms to develop a clear understanding about which big data retrieved from social media can be useful to improve their knowledge management practices and enhance their innovation capacity.

"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms' financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria's. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig. 1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management's post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study's findings were used to develop Fig. 2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management's support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study's hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE's critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management's decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations' FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context.

"In 2012, consumers paid $32 billion in overdraft fees, representing the single largest source of revenue for banks fromdemand deposit accounts during this period. Owing to consumer attrition caused by overdraft fees and potential government regulations to reform these fees, financial institutions have become motivated to investigate their overdraft fee structures. Banks need to balance the revenue generated from overdraft fees with consumer dissatisfaction and potential churn caused by these fees. However, no empirical research has been conducted to explain consumer responses to overdraft fees or to evaluate alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees. In this research, we propose a dynamic structural model with consumer monitoring costs and dissatisfaction associated with overdraft fees. We apply the model to an enterprise-level data set of more than 500,000 accounts with a history of 450 days, providing a total of 200 million transactions. We find that consumers heavily discount the future and potentially overdraw because of impulsive spending. However, we also find that highmonitoring costs hinder consumers' effort to track their balance accurately; consequently, consumers may overdraw because of rational inattention. The large data set is necessary because of the infrequent nature of overdrafts; however, it also engenders computational challenges, which we address by using parallel computing techniques. Our policy simulations show that alternative pricing strategies may increase bank revenue and improve consumer welfare. Fixed bill schedules and overdraft waiver programs may also enhance social welfare. This paper explains consumer responses to overdraft fees and evaluates alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees.","Liu, X; Montgomery, A; Srinivasan, K",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2018.1106,banking; overdraft fees; dynamic programming; big data,2.0,,10,3,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of consumer responses to overdraft fees and alternative pricing strategies, indicating a long-term impact on bank revenue and consumer welfare, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-big data,60,25,Analyzing Bank Overdraft Fees with Big Data,2018

This is what the authors address in this paper.Design/methodology/approachThis paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts.FindingsDrawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a 'hacking marketing' approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries.Practical implicationsThis study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study's results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm.","Hafezieh, N; Pollock, N; Ryan, A",Strategic,10.1108/JEIM-12-2021-0530,Digitalised consumers; Practice; Expertise; Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Occupations; Hacking,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the transformation of marketing practices in response to digital technologies and big data, emphasizing long-term organizational development of new marketing expertise and practices.

"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the outside-in perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area.","Zhang, JZ; Watson, GF",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.04.023,Outside-in marketing; Marketing strategy; Unstructured data; Consumer privacy; Socioeconomics; Sustainability,5.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses long-term strategies for firms to adapt to megatrends and emphasizes the importance of incorporating external data and insights into decision-making, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-big data,70,20,Marketing ecosystem: An outside-in view for sustainable advantage,2020
"Information governance is crucial for firm performance. Marketing managers have been actively engaged in data analytics and information management for decision-making. Because of the role both marketing and information technology units play in information and data management, information governance needs to be well-defined in a firm. Using structure-strategy-process theory as the foundation, the authors define information governance as consisting of three dimensions: strategy, structure, and process. Based on a survey of 147 marketing managers, we demonstrate that strategy and process result in improved information quality, which enhances firm performance. IT/marketing collaboration further enhances the relationship between information strategy and information quality. The detailed analyses, results, and implications are discussed.","Sleep, S; Gala, P; Harrison, DE",Strategic,10.1080/0965254X.2024.2340458,Marketing/IT collaboration; information quality; information governance; firm performance,5.0,,10,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the importance of information governance and its relationship to firm performance, which aligns with long-term strategic planning.

"This study develops and confirms a model that examines the relationship between Big Data Analytics Capabilities (BDAC), Blockchain Technology (BT), and Internationalization Process (IP). It also requires various efforts to explore how Dynamic Accounting Information System Capability (DAISC) mediates the interconnections between BDAC, BT, and IP. This study focuses on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam, which are widely recognized as crucial to the Vietnamese economy. The current research utilized the hypothetico-deductive method. The proposed model's hypothesized linkages were based on a comprehensive evaluation of relevant literature and investigations. The statistics database was created using a paper-and-pencil survey distributed to 612 accountants in SMEs in southern Vietnam utilizing the convenient and snowball sampling technique. A covariance-based structural equation modelling approach was used to assess the measurement and structural models in this research due to its ability to offer a strong foundation for analyzing intricate linkages within a research framework. The outcome confirmed the significant and positive relationships between BDAC, BT, and IP. Concurrently, these relationships were partially influenced by DAISC. The practitioners would greatly benefit from detailed insights on the findings, as they would provide guidance on how to identify and take advantage of the growth opportunities afforded by digital technology. Moreover, the observations could provide policymakers with new insights on necessary policy measures to support the application of digital technologies and encourage the implementation of a dynamic accounting information system, which could result in significant benefits in the future.","Pham, HQ; Vu, PK",Strategic,10.2478/mmcks-2024-0007,dynamic accounting information system; big data analytics; internationalization; Small and Medium Enterprises,5.0,,10,5,SCIENDO,"The study focuses on long-term implications of Big Data Analytics Capabilities and Blockchain Technology on the Internationalization Process of SMEs, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making.",wos-big data,60,20,Managing big data and blockchain for enterprise internationalization process: Mediating role of dynamic accounting system capability,2024
"PurposeThis study aims to investigate organizational learning, represented by the absorptive capacity, as a condition for the firm to learn about marketing data and make more informed decisions. The authors also aimed to understand how the behavior of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) businesses differ in this scenario through a multilevel perspective.Design/methodology/approachPlacing absorptive capacity as a mediator of the relationship between business analytics and rational marketing decisions, the authors analyzed data from 224 Brazilian retail companies using structural equation modeling estimated with partial least squares. To test the cross-level moderation effect, the authors also performed a multilevel analysis in RStudio.FindingsThe authors found a partial mediation of the absorptive capacity in the relation between business analytics and rational marketing decisions. The authors also discovered that, in the MSMEs firms' group, even if smaller companies find it more difficult to use data, those that do may reap more benefits than larger ones. This is due to the influence of size in how firms handle information.Research limitations/implicationsThe sample size, despite having shown to be consistent and valid, is considered small for a multilevel study. This suggests that our multilevel results should be viewed as suggestive, rather than conclusive, and subjected to further validation.Practical implicationsRather than solely positioning business analytics as a tool for decision support, the authors' analysis highlights the importance for firms to develop the absorptive capacity to enable ongoing acquisition, exploration and management of knowledge.Social implicationsMSMEs are of economic and social importance to most countries, especially developing ones. This research aimed to improve understanding of how this group of firms could transform knowledge into better decisions. The authors also highlight micro and small firms' difficulties with the use of marketing data so that they can have more effective practices.Originality/valueThe research contributes to the understanding of organizational mechanisms to absorb and learn from the vast amount of current marketing information.

"Purpose Based on an organizational capability perspective, this paper aims to propose a development model for social media analytics (SMA) capability that can be applied to business-to-business (B2B) marketing, with the aim of facilitating the use and integration of SMA in B2B marketing and maximizing the benefits of business networks in the age of social media. Design/methodology/approach This is a critical interpretive synthesis of SMA publications collected from academic journals, business magazines and the SMA service industry. In addition, an inter-disciplinary approach was adopted by drawing upon both marketing and information systems literature. In total, 123 academic papers, 106 industry case studies and 141 magazine papers were identified and analyzed. The findings were synthesized and compiled to address the predefined research question. Findings An SMA capability development model is proposed. The proposed model consists of four inter-dependent levels (technological, operational, managed and strategic) that collectively transfer the technological capability of SMA to the dynamic organizational capability. Each level of SMA capability is detailed. SMA-in-B2B marketing is highlighted as a socio-technical phenomenon, in which a technological level SMA capability is emphasized as the foundation for developing organizational level SMA capabilities and organizational capabilities, in turn, supporting and managing SMA activities and practices (e.g. strategic planning, social and cultural changes, skills and resources, measurements and values). Originality/value This study may have implications for the adoption, use, integration and management of SMA in B2B marketing. The proposed model is grounded on the integrated insights from academia and industry. It is particularly relevant to B2B firms that have engaged in or plan to engage in applying SMA to extract insights from their online networks and is relevant to B2B researchers who are interested in SMA, big data and information technology organization integration studies.","Wang, Y; Rod, M; Deng, Q; Ji, SB",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-05-2019-0173,Social media analytics; Business-to-business marketing; Social media; Literature review; B2B; Analytics; Capability,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract proposes a development model for social media analytics capability in B2B marketing, which aligns with strategic planning and long-term organizational goals.

"Strategic management has extensively contributed to the development of business model research. Although marketing concepts (e.g., customers, value creation, delivery, and exchange) form an essential part of any business model description, from an academic standpoint, the strategy literature has been slow to incorporate contributions from the marketing literature on business model research. Drawing on mixed bibliometric techniques combining co-citation analysis (CCA) and bibliographic coupling analysis (BCA), we seek to fill this gap by exploring the origins and trends of business model research in marketing journals (285 articles published in 38 marketing journals). The CCA reveals three theoretical pillars labelled 'business model rationale in marketing', 'business model conceptual origins', and 'business model literature de-velopments' that provide a consistent base for cross-fertilization. The BCA uncovers eight con-versations organized into two research streams, namely 'holistic perspective' and 'downstream perspective'. Considering these results, we discuss the partial appropriation of marketing issues by strategists and propose a three-pronged research agenda based on consumer data as a major source of competitive advantage.","Maucuer, R; Renaud, A; Ronteau, S; Muzellec, L",Strategic,10.1016/j.lrp.2022.102219,Business model research; Marketing discipline; Downstream; Demand-side; Customer-centric; Bibliometrics,15.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of integrating marketing concepts into strategic management and business model research, highlighting theoretical developments and proposing a research agenda, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-big data,70,10,What can we learn from marketers?

We conduct an exploratory analysis by region, followed by a cluster analysis of 45 countries. We argue that the findings respond to un-certainty avoidance, with clear differences between Europe, America and Asia-Pacific.

"This paper analyzes an emerging rebate mode where a cashback website not only serves as a promotional device in generating more sales for an online retailer, but also makes decisions on its marketing effort autonomously under certain product availability conditions set by the online retailer. Using a game-theoretic approach, this paper analyzes the optimal decision of both parties in commission-driven rebate mode and marketing-based rebate mode in a market dominated by the online retailer and cashback website respectively. Our main findings are as follows: (1) In the Retailer Stackelberg (RS) game, which rebate mode an online retailer will adopt is related to the marketing cost of the rebate channel and the consumer utility discount (UD) factor. (2) Both rebate modes will help the retailer to expand the market and increase profit because of price differentiation. (3) There is a possible price trap in marketing-based rebate mode. (4) In RS game, the effect of consumer UD factor on the optimal marketing effort is related to the product availability in the rebate channel. (5) In both RS game and Cashback-website Stackelberg (CS) game, the online retailer should strive to become a leader. However, the cashback website prefers the online retailer to be a leader when marketing cost is relatively low in the marketing-based mode.

"Purpose Decision-makers must be well-informed to successfully impact the future of the business. The purpose of this study was to explore experiences of US fashion retail executives when making business decisions to understand what resources and strategies are utilized within the decision-making process. Additionally, the role of academic research within executive decision-making process was explored. Design/methodology/approach This study utilized a phenomenological approach to understand the experiences of fashion retail executives when engaging in business decision-making. Fifteen US fashion retail executives participated in the study. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews and thematically coded to gain a holistic perspective of the decision-making process within the fashion retail industry. Findings As the result of the data analysis and interpretation, three topical areas emerged:: Incredible Amounts of Information, Industry Specific Academic Research and Have a Clear Road Map. The findings suggested that while the facts gleaned from internal and external data are of great importance to fashion professionals, insights gathered from social media are equally influential within the decision-making process. The authors identified five major strategies utilized consistently by fashion retail executives regardless of the type of business they represented: collaboration, adaptability, speed, gut instinct and creativity. Research limitations/implications The results are important to fashion retail companies for improving internal decision-making processes. The identified resources and strategies of the decision-making process can be incorporated into fashion program curricula and considered as learning outcomes when preparing future industry professionals.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish a reference model that will allow us to understand the factors that influence the omnichannel management of an organization in a business-to-business (B2B) context. Design/methodology/approach In building the model, a partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was followed. More than 1,000 executives with a C-level profile (chief executive officer, chief marketing officer or chief digital officer), from manufacturers and wholesalers, in various industries worldwide were contacted. The final sample consisted of 124 C-level executives in multinational B2B companies from 35 countries worldwide. Findings The principal finding is that optimal omnichannel management must involve a customer-centric proposition forming the basis for individualized marketing that tailors the company's portfolio of solutions to suit each client. To ensure this, customer knowledge at each touchpoint is essential. The results show that the main predictor of B2B omnichannel management is sales and marketing, even above channels. The principal conclusions are that the model shows that good omnichannel performance is measured by the performance of the industrial buyer. Loyalty and experience are primary measures of this customer's performance.

"Our increasing capacity to collect, store, and analyze large volumes of data has changed the way in which organizational decision makers approach their work. The ability to accurately quantify variables that previously had been assigned to the gut instinct of grizzled veterans or subject to the wisdom of sages for interpretation can now be more objectively understood. The implications for organizational performance are clear: better data and better decisions yield better performance. In many functions, like marketing, this capability has resulted in a true revolution in how companies come to understand and most profitably serve customers. Other areas, such as talent management, have lagged behind in this regard. This is largely due to the fact that many of the relevant variables (e.g., personality) are difficult to measure. It is also because the relationship between these variables and organizational performance is not entirely understood. Recent developments regarding how we understand and then link individual characteristics and performance are enabling a data revolution in the area of talent management. Herein, we offer three examples that illustrate how data can now be used to improve talent management decisions and, ultimately, organizational performance.

"The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: the number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments. We also discuss how to evaluate whether field experiments can help optimize other marketing decisions, such as selecting which products to advertise or promote.","Li, JQ; Rusmevichientong, P; Simester, D; Tsitsiklis, JN; Zoumpoulis, SI",Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.2014.2066,field experiments; promotions; big data; sparsity,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses optimizing marketing decisions, specifically pricing strategies, through field experiments and explores the long-term implications of these methods on marketing strategies, which aligns closely with strategic planning.",wos-big data,70,20,The Value of Field Experiments,2015
"The challenge in today's corporations is that even though the technology portfolio of a company plays a crucial role in delivering revenue-falling as a topic mainly under the area of technology management-technology may have a negative image due to observed risks or failing the sustainability criteria. It may influence the company's image and brand image, possibly also influencing decisions at corporate level. The monitoring of technology sentiments is therefore emphasized, benefiting from the advanced methods for business environment scanning, namely market and competitor intelligence functions. This paper utilizes a new big data based method, mostly utilized in market(MI)/competitor intelligence(CI) functions of the company, opinion mining, to analyse the global media sentiment of nuclear power and projects deploying the technology. With this approach, it is easier to understand the linkage to corporate images of companies deploying the technology and also related corporate decisions, mainly done in the areas of technology market deployment, marketing and strategic planning. The results indicate how the media sentiment towards nuclear power has been mostly negative globally, particularly in social media. In addition, results from similar analyses from a single company's images for the companies currently deploying the technology are seemingly less negative, indicating the influence of company's communication and branding activities. This paper has implications showing that a technology's media sentiment can influence a company's brand image, marketing communications and the need for actions when technology is deployed. In conclusion, there seems to be a need for better co-operation between different corporate functions, namely technology management, MI, marketing and strategic planning, in order to indicate technology image impacts and also counteract firestorms from social media.","Nuortimo, KP; Härkönen, J",Strategic,10.37380/jisib.v9i1.401,Company media analysis; editorial media; learning machine; market intelligence; media-analysis; nuclear power; opinion mining; social media; web intelligence,5.0,,10,5,"HALMSTAD UNIV, SWEDEN","The abstract discusses the long-term implications of technology sentiment on corporate branding and decision-making, indicating a focus on strategic planning and the need for cooperation between various corporate functions.",wos-big data,60,20,Exploring new ways to utilise the market intelligence (MI) function in corporate decisions: Case opinion mining of nuclear power,2019
"Purpose As two essential styles of firm decision-making, the relationships among effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance are unclear. It is helpful to deepen the understanding of reasoning theory and the process of decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on 31 independent empirical studies (including 11,600 samples) published by predecessors, meta-analysis is used to systematically integrate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance and explore the potential factors affecting their relationship. Findings The results show a positive correlation between two decision-making styles and firm performance and the influence of effectuation decision-making style in firm performance is slightly stronger. However, the application environment is different: in the emerging market, the causation decision-making style is more effective for firm performance management. When the firm chooses the effectuation decision-making style, it is more effective for performance management in the emerging market. In addition, the industry type, firm performance evaluation tools, national development level and firm scale and firm age can significantly moderate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance. Research limitations/implications Both decision-making logics are possible ways for firm to success. Still, the future needs to dig deeper into the black box that can unlock the decision-making styles to achieve firm performance or competitive advantage based on other factors of the decision-behavior-outcome business model, more longitudinal data and experiments.

"Co-branding is an effective way for companies to expand their market and increase brand awareness. To study the conditions for a co-branding strategy, we develop a two-stage differential game model involving two manufacturers and an online platform to explore the choice of supply chain members, incorporating consumer reference price behavior. Interestingly, a result shows that manufacturers choose to co-brand if the combined impact factor is large and the revenue-sharing factor is medium, and the response of the platform for this choice is positive. Another finding is that although the impact of co-branding on operational decisions and consumers is uncertain, it is found that proper co-branding is a powerful tool for marketing strategies. In addition, the existence of reference price behavior improves operational decisions and influences the choice of a co-branding strategy. Furthermore, the extended model proves that big data marketing effectively expands the range of co-branding strategy selections.","Wang, XQ; Yin, HY; Ma, DQ",Strategic,10.1007/s10660-023-09759-5,Co-branding; Consumer reference price behavior; Differential game; Co-branding strategy selection,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses co-branding strategies and their impact on market expansion and brand awareness, which aligns with long-term strategic planning for organizations.",wos-big data,60,25,Understanding consumer reference price behavior in co-branding: from the perspective of a dynamic supply chain,2023
"Big data is here for some and coming for many. It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies. We offer insights for market research practitioners and marketers alike, to ensure they are getting the best from their data for robust marketing decision-making.","Kennedy, R; Scriven, J; Nenycz-Thiel, M",Strategic,10.2501/IJMR-2014-041,,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of big data in marketing, emphasizing the importance of understanding and interpreting data for long-term decision-making and knowledge advancement, which aligns with strategic goals.",wos-big data,60,25,When 'significant' is not significant,2014
"While it is clear that business analytics (BA), on average, adds value to firms, it is less clear why some firms perform better than others in leveraging their data assets. To a large degree, prior research has attributed such differences to the human factor. Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning what impact competencies of key personnel have on generating value from BA initiatives, and to what extent such outcomes complement a firm's investment in BA. To examine these questions, this study explores the complementary relationship between BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills. It posits that the concurrent presence of both indirectly influences innovation outcomes by fostering a data-driven culture. We build on a sample of 185 individuals with supervisory positions in Turkey to unpack this process. The findings revealed that BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills influence a firm's data-driven culture, which in turn impacts the firms' marketing innovation, and subsequently its innovative performance. That is, data-driven culture and firms' marketing innovation are relevant underlying serial mechanisms by which BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills influence innovative performance.","Abubakar, AM; Türkmen, A; Isik, V; Mikalef, P; Turel, O",Strategic,10.1080/0960085X.2024.2304030,Big data; Business analytics; data-oriented culture; Pi-shaped skills; Innovative performance; Socio-materiality theory,5.0,,10,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of leveraging business analytics through the development of a data-driven culture and pi-shaped skills, which are critical for innovation outcomes.

"Firms facing a dynamic marketplace associated with the increasing adoption of new-age technology, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of stakeholders seek guidance on the investment of scarce resources across these three primary dimensions. The key questions facing firms are: How can we capitalize on the three primary dimensions (the increasing new-age technology adoption, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of key stakeholders) and overcome their associated challenges to achieve sustainable firm growth? This study aims to revive the thinking based on the growth strategy literature in the current environment, by presenting a 4E growth strategy matrix comprising of entrenching, empowering, enterprising, and enriching growth strategies. We propose that a firm can invest resources to maximize on one, two, or all three primary dimensions to produce the four growth strategies. We present an organizing frame-work based on insights from our triangulated research approach. Each of the growth strategies discussed will result in building certain types of firm capabilities, which will then lead to serving the needs and well-being of the key stakeholders. We also present an extensive research agenda that emerges from the four growth strategies. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"Since its first entry into the literature discussion in the 1980s, customer relationship management (CRM) has found its way into nearly every company. Concepts like personalization, loyalty programs, and customer valuation are used regularly to interact with and prioritize customers. Unsurprisingly, this more widespread use has changed our understanding of CRM substantially and as a consequence, the field has seen a remarkable transformation in the past 3 decades. Yet, the CRM strategies implemented by many firms today are frequently still fundamentally based on an understanding of CRM from the early days. The purpose of this article is to outline the origins of CRM and to present the main wisdoms that firms believed to be true about customers 3 decades ago. I then discuss the key insights that academics and managers have obtained in recent years that increasingly challenge those wisdoms. The article ends with an outlook of CRM in years to come and presents some of the major challenges practitioners and researchers will have to deal with in the near future.

"While data-driven innovation (DDI) is receiving substantial attention from academics and industry specialists, there is limited research on its dimensions and effects in marketing. We address this theoretical gap by examining the following research questions: 'What are the necessary firm-level capabilities of DDI and its effects in a marketing environment?' Drawing from the resource-based view (RBV), dynamic capabilities (DC), and market orientation theories, this study presents a data-driven innovation capabilities (DDIC) framework and proposes a new conceptualisation with new data product performance through new data product creativity. Based on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, the findings offer seven propositions to enrich the emerging DDI theory in marketing and guide managerial decision making.","Sultana, S; Akter, S; Kyriazis, E",Strategic,10.1080/0965254X.2021.2013934,Data-driven innovation; data-driven innovation capabilities; management capabilities; infrastructure capabilities; talent capabilities; market orientation; dynamic capabilities; new data product creativity; new data product performance,5.0,,10,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses data-driven innovation (DDI) in marketing and examines firm-level capabilities and their effects, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic frameworks.",wos-big data,60,20,Theorising Data-Driven Innovation Capabilities to Survive and Thrive in the Digital Economy,2022
"Drawing on 55 interviews with executives across five online fashion retailers, this paper explores the challenges of price setting and management. We develop a descriptive model of 'locked-in' pricing practice to explain organisational routines focused on cost-plus pricing, alignment with competitor prices and historical pricing. Drivers include the complex and uncertain outcomes of pricing, and lack of investment in leading-edge pricing methodologies, together with inadequate training and pricing ownership. Outcomes comprise an aversion to price risk-taking, sees decisions guided by heuristics and a lack of openness to alternative pricing methods. We offer implications for pricing practice to overcome these locked-in behaviours and suggest that research addresses challenges encountered in the implementation of new pricing techniques in organisational settings to narrow the gap between theory and practice.","Wood, S; Watson, I; Teller, C",Strategic,10.1080/0267257X.2021.1900334,Online retail; big data; retail pricing; merchandising; pricing practices,5.0,,10,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses pricing practices and challenges faced by organizations, indicating a focus on long-term pricing strategies and implications for overcoming locked-in behaviors, which aligns with strategic decision-making.",wos-big data,60,25,Pricing in online fashion retailing: implications for research and practice,2021
"Abundant consumer data has made decision-making more complicated, rather than simple, for marketers. This raises an important question about which variables in the data contain reliable information for retailers to predict future consumer purchase value (CPV) to guide strategic decisions. The authors address this question by exploring the variables distinctive choice of brand country of origin (DBCOO) and country of origin diversity (COO diversity) as analytical tools to extract insights from consumer purchase data. Building on signaling theory, the authors theorize and empirically test that DBCOO and COO diversity in a consumer's purchase history can signal, and therefore help predict, CPV. Moreover, the authors explore high-involvement product categories and purchase frequency as boundary conditions to develop a comprehensive framework of COO signals as strategic analytical tools. They find that DBCOO in a consumer's purchase history indeed increases CPV and that this relationship is enhanced for high-involvement product categories but moderated curvilinearly by purchase frequency. Moreover, they find that the COO diversity-CPV link is positive but interacts negatively with both moderators. This allows retailers to successfully distinguish high- from low-CPV consumers and thus enables them to manage the marketing mix and resources more effectively.","Rahman, RU; Heinberg, M; Banerjee, S; Katsikeas, CS",Strategic,10.1177/1069031X241254038,country of origin; consumer analytics; consumer purchase value; COO diversity; consumer-based strategy; high-involvement product,5.0,,5,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract focuses on long-term decision-making for marketers by utilizing consumer data to predict future consumer purchase value, which aligns with strategic planning.

"Purpose - In the data-driven era, the quality of the data exchanged between suppliers and buyer can enhance the buyer's ability to appropriately cope with the risks and uncertainties associated with raw material purchasing. This paper aims to address the issue of supplier selection and purchasing planning considering the quality of data by benefiting from suppliers' synergistic effects. Design/methodology/approach - An approach is proposed to measure data visibility's total value using a multi-stage algorithm. A multi-objective mathematical optimization model is then developed to determine the optimal integrated purchasing plan in a multi-product setting under risk. The model contemplates three essential objective functions, i.e. maximizing total data quality and quantity level, minimizing purchasing risks and minimizing total costs. Findings - With emerging competitive areas, in the presence of industry 4.0, internet of things and big data, high data quality can improve the process of supply chain decision-making. This paper supports the managers for the procurement planning of modern organizations under risk and thus provides an in-depth understanding for the enterprises having the readiness for industry 4.0 transformation. Originality/value - Various data quality attributes are comprehensively subjected to deeper analysis. An applicable procedure is proposed to determine the total value of data quality and quantity required for supplier selection. Besides, a novel multi-objective optimization model is developed to determine the purchasing plan under risk.","Shabani-Naeeni, F; Yaghin, RG",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-02-2020-0108,Performance measurement; Planning; Buyer-seller relationship; Sourcing; Supplier evaluation; Multi-objective decision-making; Business-to-business relationship; Purchasing planning; Supplier data visibility; Data science; Synergy of suppliers,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract focuses on supplier selection and purchasing planning, which are long-term decisions that define organizational goals and strategies in managing risks and uncertainties in the procurement process.

"Purpose Market orientation (MO) (intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness) is known as one of the key concepts in marketing literature. Although prior research has widely focused on the meaning and application of MO, few attempts have been made to explore how market-oriented firms lead to innovation and market performance and what factors actually moderate this relationship. To fill this gap, the present study aims to explore the relationship between MO, innovation and market performance. This study also attempts to examine the intervening role of IT infrastructure, business analytics (BA) capabilities and market turbulence in the proposed model. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a questionnaire-based survey was undertaken to test the proposed hypotheses. To verify the proposed theoretical model, partial least squares (PLS)/structured equation modeling (SEM) was performed with 114 valid survey data. Findings Despite prior studies which postulated innovation performance as the final outcome of MO (Han et al., 1998; Song et al., 2015), this study focused on innovation performance as a mediating outcome which finally leads to market performance. The statistical results approve the putative relationship which means managers would be able to realize the paramount role of innovation as an integral part of achieving higher market performance. In addition, no support was found for the relationship between intelligence generation and responsiveness. This finding shows that not all obtained information can help managers in the decision-making process. Originality/value This study aims to enrich literature by developing a conceptual model to test the link between MO, innovation and market performance. The value of this study is to investigate the roles of flexible IT infrastructure, BA capabilities and market turbulence as the potential moderators in the proposed model. The results advance the understanding of the influence of BA capabilities on the link between intelligence dissemination and responsiveness. Findings also show innovation performance as remarkable and deemed valuable capability, leading to higher performance in marketing-related activities, particularly in highly turbulent markets.","Ashrafi, A; Ravasan, AZ",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-05-2017-0109,Market orientation; Responsiveness; Business analytics capability; Flexible IT infrastructure; Intelligence dissemination; Intelligence generation,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of market orientation, innovation, and market performance, which are key elements of strategic planning in marketing.

"As a marketing strategy, co-branding has become popular among brand manufacturers in recent years. Unlike previous studies on co-branding, we extend the research from manufacturer-to-manufacturer coopetition stra-tegies to a platform-based supply chain. This paper builds two game theory models involving two manufacturers and one online platform, and divides consumers into Mavericks and Herds, who seek uniqueness and uniformity, respectively, and discusses the channel selection and the market positioning strategy. Some interesting findings are obtained, first, the equilibrium decisions are improved and the optimal profits are enhanced by considering the upstream and downstream cooperation. Second, the online retail channel is chosen when the revenue-sharing ratio is medium and the commission rate is low. Third, brand manufacturers have more opportunities to choose the online retail channel when the co-branded product is marketed to Herds, which is summarized as the market segmentation effect.","Ma, DQ; Wang, XQ; Hu, JS; Li, ZC",Strategic,10.1016/j.elerap.2023.101309,Co-branding; Game theory; Sales channel selection; Market segmentation effect; Consumer behavior preferences,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER,"The abstract discusses long-term marketing strategies and decision-making processes related to co-branding within a platform-based supply chain.

"While the benefits of CSR may offer suppliers a competitive advantage in their customer market, CSR remains a paradox as firms struggle to strike a balance between the financial, social, and environmental interests of stakeholders. Such confliction is greatly intensified for firms whose core business and/or marketing communi-cations contradict the general social and environmental interests of the society. Considering theories and con-cepts borrowed from consumer behavior that appear to have been influential in explaining pertinent B2B buyer purchasing decisions, this paper empirically investigates the contingency conditions underpinning CSR and its communication effect on organizational customer outcomes. Our results, based on panel data from Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) and Compustat database, suggest that on average B2B firms' CSR communications significantly enhance their firm value; however, this value enhancing effect is attenuated when controversies weigh in on firms' industry and/or corporate reputations. Specifically, CSR communications have significantly positive impact on firms in regular settings, but the impact becomes negligible or even negative for firms operating in controversial industries or firms face controversial advertising problems. Theoretical and mana-gerial implications of the research are provided.","Guo, SJ; Wang, CL; Hwang, S; Jin, F; Zhou, LY",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.07.009,Corporate social responsibility; B2Bfirms?

"Purpose of the study: to understand working capital management in a large dairy company in the state of Minas Gerais, based on the behavioral approach to finance. Methodology: the research strategy based on a single case was chosen, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis tools Originality: extending the analysis of behavioral biases in decisions on investments in financial assets to the management of working capital. Main results: it was found that the most liquid accounts are those influenced by more behavioral biases. The biases present in decision-making are also consistent with the conservative profile indicated by the dynamic working capital management model. Theoretical contributions: the theoretical trade-off liquidity and profitability does not occur since a higher level of liquidity can be caused precisely by the greater profitability and cash generation capacity of the company compared to the sector. Managerial contributions: the management of working capital must assume a more strategic condition in companies and attentive to the behavioral biases of managers. As a result of the direct impacts of marketing and production policies on investment in working capital, the analysis of indicators must be aligned with the company's profile.","Cerchi, ALR; Santos, DFL",Strategic,,Dynamic Working Capital Model; Profitability; Liquidity; Dairy Sector,5.0,,10,0,FUNDACAO PEDRO LEOPOLDO,"The study focuses on understanding working capital management in a large dairy company with implications for long-term strategic planning and decision-making.

"Purpose Big data and analytics are being increasingly used by tourism and hospitality organisations (THOs) to provide insights and to inform critical business decisions. Particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty data analytics supports THOs to acquire the knowledge needed to ensure business continuity and the rebuild of tourism and hospitality sectors. Despite being recognised as an important source of value creation, big data and digital technologies raise ethical, privacy and security concerns. This paper aims to suggest a framework for ethical data management in tourism and hospitality designed to facilitate and promote effective data governance practices. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts an organisational and stakeholder perspective through a scoping review of the literature to provide an overview of an under-researched topic and to guide further research in data ethics and data governance. Findings The proposed framework integrates an ethical-based approach which expands beyond mere compliance with privacy and protection laws, to include other critical facets regarding privacy and ethics, an equitable exchange of travellers' data and THOs ability to demonstrate a social license to operate by building trusting relationships with stakeholders. Originality/value This study represents one of the first studies to consider the development of an ethical data framework for THOs, as a platform for further refinements in future conceptual and empirical research of such data governance frameworks.

"Digitalization transforms how actors conduct activities and exchange resources in business networks. Data-driven start-ups are key actors in this transformation as they are often the first to commercialize novel digital technologies and influence business networks through their strategizing. Extant Industrial Marketing & Purchasing (IMP) literature has investigated roles and strategizing in business networks. However, understanding how datadriven start-ups' specificities impact their roles and strategizing is still at its infancy. Specifically, the authors conceptually show that assumptions on how data-driven start-ups strategize contradict strategizing tenets of prior IMP literature. Therefore, previous knowledge on strategizing needs further differentiation. Addressing this research need, theories-in-use and multiple case study research on 23 data-driven start-ups is conducted to examine (1) in what network roles they operate and (2) how they strategize within and across different network roles. The study extends IMP and data-driven business model research by identifying four network roles (enabler, extender, transformer, orchestrator) and developing a specific classification framework for data-driven start-ups. Furthermore, the study shows that IMP tenets apply in specific network roles only to some extent to data-driven start-ups. Finally, three strategizing trajectories are identified, which provide a dynamic perspective to IMP literature for guiding entrepreneurs on strategizing opportunities.","Mosch, P; Winkler, C; Eggert, CG; Schumann, JH; Obermaier, R; Ulaga, W",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.01.023,Digitalization; IMP; Business networks; Data-driven start-ups; Strategizing; Case study research,5.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the roles and strategizing of data-driven start-ups within business networks, focusing on long-term impacts and the identification of specific network roles.

"PurposeThis paper intends to address the decision-making and coordination of green supply chain (GSC) considering risk-averse manufacturers under mixed carbon policy.Design/methodology/approachThis paper focuses on a GSC consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer is risk-averse (R-A). This paper employs Stackelberg game theory and mean variance analysis to assess the pricing decision-making process under various scenarios. Furthermore, cost-sharing contracts are introduced to coordinate the GSC.FindingsThe research results suggest that the green level of the product and the profit of the GSC under a centralized scenario are higher than those under a decentralized scenario, while the retail price is lower. Under the decentralized scenario, the green level of product, wholesale price and manufacturer's profit in the R-A scenario are lower than the values in the risk-neutrality scenario, while retailer's profit is higher. In addition, when a cost-sharing contract is utilized for coordination in the GSC, it can lead to Pareto improvement, regardless of whether the manufacturer makes risk-neutrality or R-A decisions.Originality/valueThis research provides a deeper understanding of GSC decision-making and coordination strategy under mixed carbon policy with consideration of R-A from a theoretical perspective and provides decision support for enterprises to choose strategies in practice.","Chen, S; Fang, MQ; Wang, LL; Su, JF; Tuo, J",Strategic,10.1108/APJML-01-2024-0065,Risk-averse; Mixed carbon policy; Green supply chain; Cost-sharing contract,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses decision-making and coordination strategies in a green supply chain context, which relates to long-term goals and the strategic planning of organizations in terms of sustainability and risk management.",wos-big data,60,20,Implications of risk-averse manufacturer on coordination of green supply chain with mixed carbon policies,2024
"This research examines the influence of backers' social networks on their backing behavior using data from a large social networking site and a reward-based crowdfunding platform. We distinguish the roles of nodes and ties in a backer's social network and assess the combined and differential effects of these two types of social relationship on the backer's pledge decisions. As backers have different motives for engaging in different crowdfunding campaigns, which range from commercially oriented technological innovation to community-based social development, we further examine how these effects differ between technology-oriented campaigns and social-oriented campaigns. We find that node-level factors (e.g., centrality) have a greater influence on technology-oriented campaigns than on social-oriented campaigns, while tie-level factors (e.g., embeddedness) have a stronger impact on social-oriented campaigns. Considering the two forms of embeddedness in tandem, we find that the effects of relational embeddedness on backers' pledge decisions are not only moderated by structural embeddedness but also contingent on campaign type. These results offer important theoretical insights into the drivers of contribution, which should be considered by crowdfunding operators and campaign proponents seeking to stimulate contribution.","Chung, YH; Li, YW; Jia, JM",Strategic,10.1007/s11747-021-00779-x,Backer behavior; Centrality; Crowdfunding; Embeddedness; Social influence; Social network; Tie strength,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The research explores the long-term influences of backers' social networks on crowdfunding behavior, providing insights that can shape goals and strategies for crowdfunding platforms and campaign proponents.",wos-big data,60,25,"Exploring embeddedness, centrality, and social influence on backer behavior: the role of backer networks in crowdfunding",2021
"Purpose - This study aims to provide probable future developments in the form of holistic scenarios for business negotiations. In recent years, negotiation research did not put a lot of emphasis on external changes. Consequently, current challenges and trends are scarcely integrated, making it difficult to support negotiation practice perspectively.

To examine the future space of negotiations, this combines qualitative and quantitative measures to base our analysis on negotiation experts' assessments, estimations and visions of the negotiation future. Findings - The results comprise an overview of five negotiation scenarios in the year 2030 and of their individual drivers. The five revealed scenarios are: digital intelligence, business as usual, powerful network - the route to collaboration, powerful network - the route to predominance and system crash. Originality/value - The scenario analysis is a suitable approach that enables to relate various factors of the negotiation environment to negotiations themselves and allows an examination of future changes in buyer-seller negotiations and the creation of possible future scenarios.

"Data mining involves extracting interesting patterns from data and can be found at the heart of operational research ( OR), as its aim is to create and enhance decision support systems. Even in the early days, some data mining approaches relied on traditional OR methods such as linear programming and forecasting, and modern data mining methods are based on a wide variety of OR methods including linear and quadratic optimization, genetic algorithms and concepts based on artificial ant colonies. The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance.

"Many marketing problems require accurately predicting the outcome of a process or the future state of a system. In this paper, we investigate the ability of the support vector machine to predict outcomes in emerging environments in marketing, such as automated modeling, mass-produced models, intelligent software agents, and data mining. The support vector machine (SVM) is a semiparametric technique with origins in the machine-learning literature of computer science. Its approach to prediction differs markedly from that of standard parametric models. We explore these differences and benchmark the SVM's prediction hit-rates against those from the multinomial logit model.

"Issue of enterprise financial distress represents the actual and interdisciplinary topic for the economic community. The bankrupt is thus one of the major externalities of today's modem economies, which cannot be avoided even with every effort Where there are investment opportunities, there are individuals and businesses that are willing to assume their financial obligations and the resulting risks to maintain and develop their standard of living or their economic activities. The decision tree algorithm is one of the most intuitive methods of data mining which can be used for financial distress prediction. Systematization literary sources and approaches prove that decision trees represent the part of the innovations in financial management. The main propose of the research is a possibility of application of a decision free algorithm for the creation of the prediction model which can be used in economy practice. Paper main aim is to create a comprehensive prediction model of enterprise financial distress based on decision trees, under the conditions of emerging markets. Paper methods are based on the decision tree, with emphasis on algorithm CART. Emerging markets included 17 countries: Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Poland Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus. Montenegro and Macedonia. Paper research is focused on the possibilities of implementation of decision tree algorithm for creation of prediction model in the condition of emerging markets. Used data contained 2,359,731 enterprises from emerging markets (30% of total amount); divided into prosperous enterprises (1,802,027) and non-prosperous enterprises (557,704); obtained from Amadeus database. Input variables for model represented 24 financial indicators, 3 dummy variables and countries GDP data, in the years 2015 and 2016. The 80% of enterprises represented training sample and 20% test sample, for model creation. The model correctly classified 93.2% of enterprises from both the training and test sample.

"How to increase competitiveness of SMEs? How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.","Antlová, K; Popelínsky, L; Tandler, J",Strategic,,information and communication strategy; small and medium-sized companies; data mining; web mining; marketing intelligence; competencies,5.0,,10,0,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,"The abstract discusses long-term growth, employee competencies, and strategic use of ICT in SMEs, aligning with defining the goals and nature of an organization.",wos-data mining,70,15,LONG TERM GROWTH OF SME FROM THE VIEW OF ICT COMPETENCIES AND WEB PRESENTATIONS,2011

"Identifying the cause and effect factors of marketing resources and prioritizing them with respect to their level of importance can build superior market performance for companies. Although there have been some studies in the literature which have used marketing resource dimensions to conduct their research, these studies have not considered the relationships between marketing resource dimensions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the cause and effect factors of marketing resources and to prioritize them in terms of their importance using the fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method. The findings of this study suggest that the dimension managerial capabilities, composed of financial management, effective human resource management and good operations management expertise, exerts a greater influence on marketing strategy than other criteria. In addition, the criterion credibility with customers through being well established in the market is the most important aspect of marketing resources.","Altuntas, S; Yilmaz, MK",Strategic,10.3846/16111699.2015.1068220,marketing resources; fuzzy logic; empirical research; SMEs; relationship between factors; importance of factors,5.0,,10,0,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,"The abstract focuses on identifying and prioritizing marketing resource dimensions and their relationships, which aligns with long-term strategic planning for improving market performance.",wos-fuzzy logic,60,25,FUZZY DEMATEL METHOD TO EVALUATE THE DIMENSIONS OF MARKETING RESOURCES: AN APPLICATION IN SMEs,2016
"The Internet offers companies many opportunities to implement new business models, called e(electronic)-business in short, and to reinforce their competitiveness in the market. It is currently suggested that business-to-business commerce, which is one of the dominant segments in e-business, is going to develop around e-marketplaces. However, the new millennium has witnessed the rise and fall of many dot.com firms and now both the companies and the investors are extremely cautious about the performance and effectiveness of the e-marketplaces. To get more benefit from this digital marketplace, suggests the use of fuzzy logic based on multi-criteria evaluation as a superior means of improving the efficiency of the decision making or the e-marketplace selection under uncertain conditions. This evaluation approach, in which both fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy Delphi methodologies are employed, enables one to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness from subjective perception and the experiences of humans in a group decision process and ensures a more convincing and effective decision making.

"The article deals with the issue of a client's creditworthiness assessment in the insurance industry. The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification ofnew factors which have relation to a client's creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client's creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The knowledge gained from the evaluation model is immediately possible to use in the strategic management of insurance companies e.g. in marketing activities.","Doskocil, R",Strategic,10.5755/j01.ee.28.1.14194,Insurance Industry; Creditworthiness; Decision-Making; Neuro-Fuzzy Model; Fuzzy Logic; Artificial Neural Network,5.0,,15,0,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,"The article focuses on the long-term implications of assessing a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry, aiming to create a comprehensive model that informs strategic management decisions within insurance companies.",wos-fuzzy logic,60,20,Evaluating the Creditworthiness of a Client in the Insurance Industry Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System,2017
"PurposeAmidst unpredictable and turbulent periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, service organization's responses are required to be innovative, adaptable and resilient. The purpose of this study is to explore the utilization of both reconfiguration and transformational strategies as instruments for cultivating resilience and advancing sustainability in service organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe study examines a proposed resilience model using fuzzy logic. The research also used a semantic differential scale to capture nuanced and intricate attitudes. Finally, to augment the validity of the resilience model, a measurement scale was formulated using business mathematics and expert opinions.FindingsAlthough investing in resilience training can help organizations gain control and maintain their operations in times of crisis, it may not directly help service organizations understand the external turmoil, seek available resources or create adaptive remedies. Conversely, high levels of reconfiguration and transformation management vigour empower a service organization's revolutionary, malleable vision, organizational structure and decision-making processes, welcoming talented and innovative employees to enhance capabilities during crises.Research limitations/implicationsThe resilience model bestows a comprehensive understanding of the pertinence of building resilience for service organizations identifying the antecedents that influence the adoption of these strategies and introduces a range of theoretical perspectives that empowers service organizations to conceptualize and plan for building resilience.

"Market segmentation is essential to target efficaciously core-segment customers and to obtain a competitive advantage. Firms when confronted by the range of market segments, have difficulty in deciding the core-segment customers who are the most probable purchasers of their product and services. We propose a novel fuzzy group multi-criteria method for market entry and segment evaluation and selection. This proposed method provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines bi-level multi-objective optimization with real option analysis (ROA) and fuzzy cooperative n-person game theory. The contribution of the proposed segment evaluation and selection method is fivefold: (1) it addresses the gaps in the marketing literature on the efficacious and effective assessment of market segments; (2) it provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines bi-level multi-objective optimization with ROA and fuzzy cooperative n-person game theory; (3) it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; (4) it does not insist on consensus but synthesizes a representative outcome based on qualitative judgments and quantitative data; and (5) it is applicable to national and international market segmentation.

"Identifying an optimal positioning strategy for new products is a critical and difficult strategic decision. In this research, we develop a genetic algorithm based procedure called GA SEARCH that identifies optimal new product positions. In two simulation comparisons and an empirical study, we compare the results from GA SEARCH to those obtained from the best currently available algorithm (PRODSRCH). We find that GA SEARCH performs better regardless of the number of ideal points, existing products, number of attributes or choice set size. Furthermore, GA SEARCH can account for choice set size heterogeneity. Results show that GA SEARCH outperformed the best current algorithm when choice set size varied at the individual level, an important source of consumer heterogeneity that has been ignored in current algorithms formulated to solve this optimization problem.

"Marketing channel choices in agricultural trade networks affect the networks' overall performance and influence rural livelihoods. This study identifies key determinants of these choices among natural rubber traders in Indonesia to evaluate four policy scenarios and their potential effects on rural incomes. Since traders' marketing decisions are based on past interactions, resulting trade networks are formed in recursive processes and can be understood as complex adaptive systems. Due to inherent endogeneity in these systems, process-based approaches such as agent-based modelling (ABM) can be effective in understanding them. Using a self-gathered primary dataset from Jambi Province, Indonesia, we implement and parameterise an ABM to simulate the formation of the rubber trading network and analyse the effects on rural livelihoods of four hypothetical policy scenarios: improved micro-credit availability, increased access to education, better infrastructure and transportation capacity, and market information availability. The model is calibrated through a genetic algorithm which maximises the similarity between the simulated network and the actual network observed in the data. Results indicate that sellers' decisions on a buyer are primarily determined by debt obligations and past peer-interactions. The most influential sellers have a similar level of formal education as their peers and live in close physical proximity. Results of the policy scenario analysis suggests that policies aimed at reducing sellers' dependence on credit from buyers and increasing education are the most effective policies for improving value chains and reducing poverty in the region under consideration.

"The motion picture industry is characterized by a dynamic market environment, limited shelf space and product category management, and consequently, complex channel contracts specifying the split of box office revenue between distributors and exhibitors. Although such a contracting practice creates a considerable administrative effort and channel conflict, it is not clear whether such complexity is necessary for superior channel performance. This study investigates this question by analyzing the impact of movie contract structure on movie scheduling and channel member profitability. We develop and analyze a game-theoretic model using the genetic algorithm approach and a decision support system, SilverScreener, to capture strategic behaviors of channel members in a complex market environment. We find that simpler two-part tariff or 50/50 split contracts perform as well as the current contracts. Thus, the complexity of the market environment need not be reflected in the complexity of the channel contracts. Channel contract structure has significant impact on channel member profitability and the exhibitor's movie-scheduling behavior. In particular, our results indicate that the. at rate contract structure represents an attractive alternative to the current practice for distributors.","Raut, S; Swami, S; Lee, E; Weinberg, CB",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1070.0315,channel contracts; movie industry; game theory,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The study investigates the long-term implications of movie contract structures on channel performance and profitability, which aligns with strategic planning in defining organizational goals and nature.",wos-genetic algorithm,60,20,How complex do movie channel contracts need to be?,2008

"Purpose This paper aims to determine new-normal uncertainty considerations stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic to consider within transaction-cost analysis for pharmaceuticals. It also aims to propose new-normal market entry strategies to address the uncertainty as a result of COVID-19's implications and provide for lack of knowledge and information in an uncertain business environment by way of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem for pharmaceutical market entry. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty facet within transaction-cost analysis consideration and utilise a descriptive three-case study approach taking in Johnson and Johnson (J&J), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novartis to present an ADO (Antecedent-Decisions-Outcomes) understanding of their usual market entry approach, the approach undertaken during the pandemic and the outcomes thereafter facilitating new-normal uncertainty considerations to factor in. Further with this insight, we develop a conceptual framework addressing the transaction-cost analysis implications of uncertainties toward lack of knowledge and information for a new-normal market entry approach and operating strategy for pharmaceuticals applicable due to IoT (Internet of Things). Findings Uncertainty (external and internal) is different now in the new-normal business environment for pharmaceuticals and boils down to acute shortage of knowledge and information impact to make an appropriately informed decision. Therefore, considering the changed factors to consider, pharmaceuticals need to be able to undertake market entry with vaccines and medicines by way of IoT thereby enabling, the filling of the gap via real-time data access and sharing, including enhancing predictive analysis for sustenance.

"Introduction. The study contributes to the theoretical knowledge by expanding understanding of auditory encoding of prices, further testing the working memory capacities, and understanding the psychological underpinnings of price perceptions. From a managerial perspective, our findings will help marketers to better understand the cognitive processes of price perception while voice-ordering through smart devices, thus improving company pricing decisions and increasing number of sales. Aim and tasks. In this study, we aim to understand the psychological underpinnings of price perception during auditory price information encoding. In particular, we research how the price pronunciation order of the item on sale (first the sale price and then the usual price or vice versa) affects the sale evaluation and subsequent purchase intention. Results. Prior to making predictions about price perception through auditory sense and its subsequent evaluation, we need to understand the cognitive processes underlying numbers encoding. Numerical cognition process follows five stages: (1) initial exposure to numerical information (i.e., numerical presentation in visual or verbal format), (2) numerical information encoding, (3) representation of the numerical information in memory, (4) retrieval of that information in order to perform some cognitive task (e.g. price evaluation), and (5) consumer response based on processed information. Thus, the internal consistency reliability of the questions has already been tested using Cronbach's alpha parameter and has been proved to be of the appropriate level. Lastly, in addition to these context-related questions, we include two attention checks questions and the question on the questionnaire purpose in order to control for random box-checking and exclude responses which guessed the study reasons from further analysis. Conclusions. From a theoretical standpoint, this study contributes to two literature streams: (1) marketing literature on pricing and (2) the psychological literature on numerical cognition. In the pricing area, the findings of the study further support and shed light on the application of the anchoring effect during purchase decisions. The study taps into the area of conscious and unconscious comparisons with price anchors and helps to reconcile previous researches who found different effects of price anchors on willingness to pay for the product or service. In addition, the study provides novel insights regarding pricing decisions in auditory rather than visual domain, laying a foundation for further exploration of this area.","Filipishina, L; Gonchar, V; Bohachov, O",Strategic,10.31520/2616-7107/2020.4.2-5,IT marketing; price perception; IOT; smart devices; anchoring,5.0,,10,0,Dr. Viktor Koval,"The study contributes to theoretical knowledge regarding price perception and auditory encoding, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making in marketing strategies.",wos-IoT,60,25,RESEARCH OF IT INFLUENCE ON THE PRICE PERCEPTION,2020

"Given the success of neural networks in a variety of applications in engineering, such as speech and image quantization, it is natural to consider its application to similar problems in other domains. A related problem that arises in business is market segmentation for which clustering techniques are used. In this paper, we explore the ability of a specific neural network, namely the Frequency-Sensitive Competitive Learning Algorithm (FSCL), to cluster data for developing strategic marketing decisions. To this end, we investigate the comparative performance of FSCL vis-a-vis the K-means clustering technique. A cluster analysis conducted on brand choice data for the coffee category revealed that the two methodologies resulted in widely differing cluster solutions. In an effort to address the dispute over the appropriate methodology, a comparative performance investigation was undertaken using simulated data with known cluster solutions in a fairly large experimental design to mimic varying data quality to reflect data collection and measurement error. Based on the results of these studies, it is observed that a combination of the two methodologies, wherein the results of the FSCL network are input as seeds to the K-means, seems to provide more managerially insightful segmentation schemes.","Balakrishnan, PV; Cooper, MC; Jacob, VS; Lewis, PA",Strategic,10.1016/0377-2217(96)00046-X,K-means; neural networks; segmentation; comparative performance; brand choice; data quality; marketing,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"The abstract discusses the application of a neural network (FSCL) to market segmentation, which is a high-level strategic decision-making process aimed at developing marketing strategies.

"The effects of the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis call for more active support for the tourism industry. To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism. This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy. The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies.","Polyakov, M; Bilozubenko, V; Nebaba, N; Korneyev, M; Saihak, Y",Strategic,10.21511/im.16(4).2020.10,tourism; country clustering; asymmetry factors; supranational policy; marketing strategy,5.0,,10,5,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of a tourism policy and the competitiveness of national tourism sectors within the EU.

"Considerable attention has been given to the notion of a set of human-like characteristics associated with brands, referred to as brand personality. The authors combine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. The authors show that brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers' minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from work focused on cataloging brain regions associated with marketing stimuli to testing and refining constructs central to theories of consumer behavior.","Chen, YP; Nelson, LD; Hsu, M",Strategic,10.1509/jmr.14.0606,consumer neuroscience; branding; brand personality; functional magnetic resonance imaging; machine learning,10.0,,10,0,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"The abstract discusses foundational concepts related to brand personality and its implications on consumer behavior, which are relevant to long-term organizational goals in marketing strategy.",wos-machine learning,60,20,From Where to What: Distributed Representations of Brand Associations in the Human Brain,2015
"Regular prices and temporary discounts are important elements for retailers' and brands' pricing decisions. These two variables need to be considered separately because consumer sensitivities to their changes typically differ. Although the scope and richness of retail datasets have grown rapidly in recent years, most of them only record actual prices paid by customers and lack direct information about regular prices and discounts. A systematic review involving close to five hundred publications that investigated pricing variables using retail scanner data confirms this, as 63% of them only observed actual prices. To solve this missing data problem, these studies often adopted heuristics to decompose actual prices into regular prices and discount depths. However, there are many such heuristics and their accuracies have not been assessed. This research introduces DEPART, a new machine learning approach based on regression trees with a publicly available R package and benchmarks it against previously used heuristics in two different datasets. The results show that on average the proposed method outperforms previously used heuristics by 26.5% or more. Additional analyses illustrate the potential economic benefits of adopting DEPART to improve pricing decisions.","Lu, HD; van der Lans, R; Helsen, K; Gauri, DK",Strategic,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2023.08.009,Regular price; Discount depth; Machine learning; Regression trees; Missing data recovery,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER,"The abstract discusses the development of a new machine learning approach to improve pricing decisions, which aligns with long-term strategic planning in pricing and retail management.",wos-machine learning,60,25,DEPART: Decomposing prices using atheoretical regression trees,2023
"We propose a generalized revealed preference approach to infer how a firm adapts to a changing environment and provide a step-by-step guide to explain how to implement it in general. To illustrate this new approach, we apply it to Prosper, which is a peer-to-peer lending platform. We develop a structural model, in which Prosper uses an adaptive learning algorithm to continuously update its predictive models about borrowers' and lenders' behavior as more data become available and uses these updated models to help assign loan ratings over time. To infer which adaptive learning algorithm Prosper may adopt, we consider a set of algorithms motivated by the machine learning literature. For each algorithm, we use observed Prosper loan-rating decisions to estimate the structural parameters of Prosper's objective function. By comparing the goodness-of-fit of these algorithm-specific models, we find that Prosper most likely uses an ensemble algorithm, which selects past observations based on their economic conditions. We conduct counterfactual experiments to shed light on: (i) How does an exclusive focus on either accurately reporting loan risk or expected current revenue influence Prosper's decision making? (ii) What is the value of adaptive learning for Prosper? (iii) Is there any potential for Prosper to improve its current adaptive learning algorithm?","Li, XL; Ching, AT",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2022.0198,choice modeling; electronic commerce; machine learning; structural models,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a generalized revealed preference approach to infer how a firm, Prosper, adapts to a changing environment.

"Timing a multinational firm's entry into a new country is a pivotal decision with long-term impact on the firm's overall performance; thus, a deeper understanding of the drivers of the decision and their interrelationship can yield significant managerial benefits. The authors explore the mediating role of market potential by decomposing the total effects of the decision's main drivers-macroeconomic attractiveness, market concentration, social heterogeneity, and population density-into direct and indirect effects. These decompositions explain the countervailing effects of some drivers that simultaneously make both positive and negative impacts. The data set encompasses mobile 4G broadband penetration in 130 countries, including market entry timings for 28 international operators in 79 countries. The authors establish the nature of the mediation effect of market potential on the drivers of entry timing. Using early penetration data, they utilize growth mixture modeling to divide the countries into four latent segments. They validate this segmentation using machine learning with the four key drivers as classifiers; the process establishes macroeconomic attractiveness as the predominant classifier. The analysis offers entry-timing guidance at both pre- and postlaunch stages.","Islam, T; Meade, N; Sood, A",Strategic,10.1177/1069031X211068072,market entry timings; machine learning; macroeconomic attractiveness; market potential; mobile broadband phones,5.0,,5,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of a multinational firm's entry timing into new markets, emphasizing the interrelationship of various macroeconomic factors and their impact on overall performance, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-machine learning,70,20,Timing Market Entry: The Mediation Effect of Market Potential,2022
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a predictive model for box office performance based on the textual information in movie scripts in the green-lighting process of movie production. Design/methodology/approach The authors use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to determine the hidden textual structure in movie scripts by extracting topic probabilities as predictors for classification. The extracted topic probabilities are used as inputs for the predictive model for the box office performance. For the predictive model, the authors utilize a variety of classification algorithms such as logistic classification, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector machines and artificial neural networks, and compare their relative performances in predicting movies' market performance. Findings This approach for extracting textual information from movie scripts produces a valuable typology for movies. Moreover, our modeling approach has significant power to predict movie scripts' profitability. It provides a superior prediction performance compared to previous benchmarks, such as that of Eliashberg et al. (2007). Research limitations/implications This work contributes to literature on predicting the box office performance in the green-lighting process and literature regarding suggesting models for the idea screening stage in the new product development process. Besides, this is one of the few studies that use movie script data to predict movies' financial performance by proposing an approach to integrate text mining models and machine learning algorithms with movie experts' intuition. Practical implications First, the authors' approach can significantly reduce the financial risk associated with movie production decisions before the pre-production stage. Second, this paper proposes an approach that is applicable at a very early stage of new product development, such as the idea screening stage. The authors also introduce an online-based movie scenario database system that can help movie studios make more systematic and profitable decisions in the green-lighting process. Third, this approach can help movie studios estimate movie scripts' financial value.

"Logos serve a fundamental role as the visual figureheads of brands. Yet, because of the difficulty of using unstructured image data, prior research on logo design has largely been limited to nonquantitative studies. In this work, we explore the interplay between logo design and brand identity creation from a data-driven perspective. We develop both a novel logo feature extraction algorithm that uses modern image processing tools to decompose pixel-level image data into meaningful features and a multiview representation learning framework that links these visual features to textual descriptions, consumer ratings of brand personality, and other high-level tags describing firms. We apply this framework to a unique data set of brands to understand which brands use which logo features and how consumers evaluate these brands' personalities. Moreover, we show that manipulating the model's learned representations through what we term brand arithmetic yields new brand identities and can help with ideation. Finally, through an application to fast-food branding, we show how our model can be used as a decision support tool for suggesting typical logo features for a brand and for predicting consumers' reactions to new brands or rebranding efforts.","Dew, R; Ansari, A; Toubia, O",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2021.1326,logos; branding; machine learning; multiview learning; representation learning; image processing; Bayesian estimation,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the development of a data-driven framework for logo design that influences brand identity and consumer perception, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",wos-machine learning,60,20,Letting Logos Speak: Leveraging Multiview Representation Learning for Data-Driven Branding and Logo Design,2022
"In the first decade of consumer neuroscience, strong progress has been made in understanding how neuroscience can inform consumer decision making. Here, we sketch the development of this discipline and compare it to that of the adjacent field of neuroeconomics. We describe three new frontiers for ongoing progress at both theoretical and applied levels. First, the field will broaden its boundaries to include genetics and molecular neuroscience, each of which will provide important new insights into individual differences in decision making. Second, recent advances in computational methods will improve the accuracy and out-of-sample generalizability of predicting decisions from brain activity. Third, sophisticated meta-analyses will help consumer neuroscientists to synthesize the growing body of knowledge, providing evidence for consistency and specificity of brain activations and their reliability as measurements of consumer behavior.","Smidts, A; Hsu, M; Sanfey, AG; Boksem, MAS; Ebstein, RB; Huettel, SA; Kable, JW; Karmarkar, UR; Kitayama, S; Knutson, B; Liberzon, I; Lohrenz, T; Stallen, M; Yoon, C",Strategic,10.1007/s11002-014-9306-1,Consumer neuroscience; Neuroeconomics; Social neuroscience; Genes; Machine learning; Meta-analysis,10.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the development of consumer neuroscience as a discipline and outlines new frontiers for future research and applications, indicating a focus on long-term goals and advancements in understanding consumer behavior.",wos-machine learning,60,20,Advancing consumer neuroscience,2014
"Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm's expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand, they increase the liquidation value of the firm's assets, which decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on the influence that the firm's suppliers have, relative to other creditors, on the bankruptcy court's decision. Advertising and R&D increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low) level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies, show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least 35%-38% (18%-21%) of the bankrupt firm's debt has been borrowed from suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point. Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially improved by considering the firm's advertising and R&D.","Jindal, N",Strategic,10.1177/0022242920936205,advertising; bankruptcy; credit; R&D; suppliers; survival,5.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term impact of advertising and R&D on a firm's bankruptcy survival and the implications of supplier influence, indicating a focus on overarching organizational goals and survival strategies.",wos-machine learning,60,20,The Impact of Advertising and R&D on Bankruptcy Survival: A Double-Edged Sword,2020
"Romania faced the highest inflation rate in the European Union at the beginning of 2024, but progress has been made compared to that in 2023 due to the increasing interest rate. This inflation stemmed from a combination of global and domestic factors (global factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and war, rising commodity prices, domestic factors such as wage and pension increases, tax and charge hikes, and a strategy of gradual increase in the monetary policy interest rate). The National Bank of Romania (NBR) uses a combination of monetary policy instruments to target inflation and provides quarterly forecasts. However, under uncertain conditions, numerical forecasts are less reliable, and the inclusion of sentiment analysis in forecasts might lead to innovation in the field by improving the prediction accuracy. Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important in the field of economics, offering valuable insights and potentially improving economic forecasting and decision-making due to rapid technological progress. Sentiment analysis can identify potential changes in consumer behaviour and business decisions before they are translated into actual economic data, providing an early warning system for economic trends and potential crises. The methodological background relies on natural language processing to extract sentiment indices for large amounts of texts in Inflation Reports provided by NBR. Moreover, the sentiment indices calculated by IntelliDocker are incorporated into autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models to provide quarterly inflation forecasts. This type of econometric model has the advantage of addressing endogeneity. Moreover, the unemployment rate is considered an inflation predictor since tensions in the labour market might impact inflation. This paper contributes to empirical forecasting by proposing sentiment forecasts that are more accurate than NBR numerical forecasts corresponding to the 2006: Q1-2023: Q4 horizon. The new forecasting method might be used to make inflation predictions for the next quarters. More accurate forecasts would be valuable for businesses, the central bank, policymakers, and the general public. However, while sentiment analysis offers valuable insights, it is important to remember that human judgment and expertise remain essential for interpreting the data and making informed economic decisions.","Simionescu, M; Nicula, AS",Strategic,10.21272/mmi.2024.2-02,inflation; forecasts; sentiment index; natural language processing,5.0,,10,5,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY","The abstract discusses long-term economic forecasting and the role of sentiment analysis in improving inflation predictions in Romania.

"Time series forecasting in retail plays an important role for retailers due to its capacity to aid managers in strategic planning to meet demand. In this article, a comparative experiment between two demand forecasting models is conducted to forecast an aggregate time series in Brazilian food retail on a twelve-year horizon. Performance was analyzed by comparing the accuracy of a linear model, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and a non-linear model, and Wavelets Neural Network (WNN). Performance was validated by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and U-Theil, with a view to achieving the most accurate measurement of demand responsiveness, using the Fill Rate (FR). WNN had the best performance, with a FR of 98.43%, whereas SARIMA achieved a FR of 102.23%.

"One of the substantial challenges in marketing efforts is determining optimal markets, specifically in market segmentation. The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets.

"Purpose - This study aims to explore the dynamic interplay of key resources (i.e. research and development (R&D), advertising and exports) in affecting the performance of USA manufacturing firms. Specifically, the authors examine the dynamic impact of joint resources and predict differential effect scales contingent on firm capabilities.Design/methodology/approach - This study presents a combined multiple regression analysis (MRA)-multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network modeling and investigates the complex interlinkage of capabilities, resources and performance. As an innovative approach, the MRA-MLP model investigates the effect of capabilities under the combinatory deployment of joint resources.Findings - This study finds that the impact of joint resources and synergistic rents is not uniform but rather distinctive according to the combinatory conditions and that the pattern is further shaped by firm capabilities. Accordingly, besides signifying the contingent aspect of capabilities across a range of resource combinations, the result also shows that managerial sophistication in adaptive resource control is more than a managerial ethos.Practical implications - The proposed analytic process provides scientific decision support tools with control mechanisms with respect to deploying multiple resources and setting actionable goals, thereby presenting pragmatic benchmarking options to industry managers.Originality/value - Using the theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based view (RBV) and resource orchestration, this study advances knowledge about the complex interaction of key resources by presenting a salient analytic process.

"The study explores the reasons that drive and hinder consumers' willingness to migrate to the metaverse. To determine them, a mixed-methods approach is used: phase 1 (qualitative) involves conceptual development of a model based on in-depth consumer interviews, and in phase 2, the conceptual model is empirically tested via structural equation modeling. Results show that social presence is a crucial enabler, while realistic and symbolic threats are significant inhibitors of the willingness to migrate. Preusage cognitive dissonance significantly mediates the relationships between social escapism, social pressure, realistic threat, symbolic threat, and willingness to migrate. Specifically, the mediating influence between empowerment and willingness to migrate is higher for individuals with low metaverse anxiety. Results of the artificial neural network technique indicate that social presence is the most significant antecedent of willingness to migrate, and results of the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis highlight the presence of six distinct configurations that indicate a high willingness to migrate. This study enriches the behavioral reasoning theory by examining the interplay of the reasons influencing the willingness to migrate. Further, it contributes to the intergroup threat theory by investigating the potential link between willingness to migrate and the presence of realistic and symbolic threats.","Kumar, A; Shankar, A",Strategic,10.1002/mar.22009,anxiety; behavioral reasoning theory; cognitive dissonance; intergroup threat theory; metaverse; willingness to migrate,5.0,,10,5,WILEY,"The study investigates the long-term motivations and barriers regarding consumer migration to the metaverse, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making in marketing contexts.",wos-neural network,60,20,The bold decision to go all in: Understanding the reasons behind consumers' willingness to migrate to the metaverse,2024
"Purpose While there is an abundant amount of literature studies on mobile payment adoption, there is a scarce of knowledge concerning the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies. As those technologies are mainly concerned with security and users' trust, the question of how security factors and trust can influence the sustainable use of those technologies within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is still unanswered. This research thus develops a theoretical model based on integrating the protection motivation theory (PMT) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), extended with perceived trust (PT) to explore the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies. Design/methodology/approach The developed model is evaluated based on data collected through a web-based survey from 523 users who used contactless payment technologies. Unlike the existing literature, the collected data were analyzed using a hybrid structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) technique. Findings The data analysis results reinforced all the proposed relationships in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results showed that PT has the largest impact on the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies with 97.2% normalized importance, followed by self-efficacy (SE) (77%), satisfaction (72.1%), perceived vulnerability (PV) (48.9%), perceived usefulness (PU) (48.2%), perceived severity (PS) (40.7%), response efficacy (RE) (28.7%) and response costs (RCs) (24.1%). Originality/value The originality of this research lies behind the development of an integrated model based on PMT and ECM to understand the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies.

"Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample. For managers and researchers alike, our criteria offer a verifiable explanation for differences in marketing elasticities and an actionable connection between marketing and financial performance metrics.","Hanssens, DM; Pauwels, KH; Srinivasan, S; Vanhuele, M; Yildirim, G",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2013.0841,consumer attitude metrics; responsiveness; potential; stickiness; sales conversion; hierarchical linear model; cross-effects model; empirical generalizations; dynamic programming model; optimal marketing resource allocation,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract focuses on long-term insights that connect marketing actions to sales performance, providing a framework for decision-making in marketing strategy.

"The general aim of this study is to provide a guide to the future marketing decisions of a firm, using a model to predict customer lifetime values. The proposed framework aims to eliminate the limitations and drawbacks of the majority of models encountered in the literature through a simple and industry-specific model with easily measurable and objective indicators. In addition, this model predicts the potential value of the current customers rather than measuring the current value, which has generally been used in the majority of previous studies. This study contributes to the literature by helping to make future marketing decisions via Markov decision processes for a company that offers several types of products. Another contribution is that the states for Markov decision processes are also generated using the predicted customer lifetime values where the prediction is realized by a regression-based model. Finally, a real world application of the proposed model is provided in the banking sector to show the empirical validity of the model. Therefore, we believe that the proposed framework and the developed model can guide both practitioners and researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors.","Harmeling, CM; Palmatier, RW; Fang, E; Wang, DW",Strategic,10.1509/jm.15.0495,group marketing; group dynamics; conforming purchase behavior; dynamic group influence; group norms,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The research addresses fundamental psychological mechanisms of group influence on customer behavior, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and understanding market dynamics.

"Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and clean products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion.

"This article investigates member deliveries in agricultural marketing cooperatives. Since cooperatives depend on members' contributions to achieve efficiency in processing and marketing, side-selling by members poses a threat to the economic viability of cooperatives in the long run. We develop a model for the farmers' marketing decision that relates farm size to the share of produce delivered to the cooperative. Based on survey data from cooperatively organised coffee farmers in Costa Rica, we find that the share delivered to cooperatives decreases with farm size, albeit at a decreasing rate. The empirical results thus confirm the theoretical model prediction of a u-shaped relationship between farm size and member deliveries.","Wollni, M; Fischer, E",Strategic,10.1093/erae/jbu023,cooperatives; patronage; side-selling; coffee; Costa Rica,5.0,,10,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"The article discusses member deliveries in agricultural marketing cooperatives, focusing on the long-term economic viability of these organizations, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making.",wos-prediction,70,10,Member deliveries in collective marketing relationships: evidence from coffee cooperatives in Costa Rica,2015
"The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%-6% in transactions' prices. Our results lend ample support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic behavior.","Mantin, B; Rubin, E",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2015.0965,strategic consumers; decision support; revenue management; information availability; airline industry,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the impact of consumer behavior on pricing strategies and the use of decision support tools, which align with long-term strategic planning and pricing decisions.",wos-prediction,60,25,Fare Prediction Websites and Transaction Prices: Empirical Evidence from the Airline Industry,2016
"Investments in new marketing offerings are notoriously risky, as they require firms to make judgments about an uncertain future. The authors develop an option-thinking framework for valuing and selecting new marketing offerings that combines real-options theory with virtual markets. They apply the framework and demonstrate its power empirically in the context of experiential content, where valuing marketing offerings constitutes a particularly challenging issue. Specifically, they test the proposed option-thinking framework in two experiential settings (movies and professional team sports) and compare it to current managerial practice. Each experiential setting deals with a common managerial marketing challenge. Study 1 examines extending a brand into a new category, and Study 2 investigates ingredient branding. The proposed framework provides managers with an empirical approach that enables them to consider the value of waiting when making investment decisions that involve uncertainty regarding future market developments.","Völckner, F; Spann, M; Sattler, H; Schwerdtfeger, R; Hennig-Thurau, T; Hirche, M",Strategic,10.1080/08997764.2023.2224302,,5.0,,10,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses a framework for valuing and selecting new marketing offerings that involves long-term decision-making under uncertainty, aligning with strategic planning.

"Orientation: Business rescue has become a critical part of business strategy decision making, especially during economic downturns and recessions. Past legislation has generally supported creditor-friendly regimes, and its mind-set still applies, which increases the difficulty of such turnarounds. There are many questions and critical issues faced by those involved in rescue. Despite extensive theory in the literature on failure, there is a void regarding practical verifiers of the signs and causes of venture decline, as specialists are not forthcoming about what they regard as their 'intellectual property'. Research purpose: This article introduces the concept and role of 'verifier determinants' of early warning signs, as a tool to confirm the causes of decline in order to direct rescue strategies and, most importantly, reduce time between the first observation and the implementation of the rescue. Motivation for the study: Knowing how specialists confirm causes of business decline in practice could assist in analysis and deciding on strategies for the rescue earlier than can be done using traditional due diligence, which is time consuming. Reducing time is a crucial element of a successful rescue. Research design and approach: The researchers interviewed specialists with extensive experience in credit for rescue and turnaround. An experimental design was used to ensure the specialists evaluated the same real cases to extract their experiences and base their decisions on. Main findings: The specialists confirmed the use of verifier determinants and identified such determinants as they personally used them to confirm causes of decline. These verifier determinants were classified into five categories namely, management, finance, strategic, banking and operations and marketing of the ventures under investigation. The verifier determinants and their use often depend heavily on subconscious (non-factual) information based on previous experiences, rendering them 'irrational' in modern management perspectives. Practical/managerial implications: Decision makers and affected persons could benefit from the insights obtained through this study. Confirming early warning signs through verifier determinants would be beneficial for entrepreneurs who are creditors, company directors, rescue practitioners, government regulators, court officials and educators alike. Contribution/value add: Knowing the verifier determinants could assist decision making and improve the effectiveness of rescue strategies. Business rescue practitioners can improve their 'investigation of the affairs' activity by using such verifier determinants.","Pretorius, M; Holtzhauzen, G",Strategic,10.4102/sajems.v16i4.450,Turnaround; business rescue; decision making; verifier determinants,5.0,,10,5,AOSIS,"The abstract discusses the role of verifier determinants in early warning signs of business decline, which relates to long-term decision-making strategies for business rescue.

"In order to boost sales in foreign markets and compete with emerging local competitors, global companies from developed countries are realizing that they need to develop products specifically for the local markets. Meanwhile, companies in developing nations are building up their design staff and seeking to establish their own global brands. This recent growth in design activity targeting overseas markets suggests the need for academic research to better understand the phenomenon of design expertise transfer across national borders. The present research explores industrial designers' expertise transfer across cultures with respect to knowledge calibration. Based on the literature on expertise and Shanteau's theory of expert competence, several hypotheses are developed regarding the main effect of culture, and the interaction between culture and expertise level, on design confidence and prediction accuracy. A three-phase experimental study is conducted to test the hypotheses. Results suggest that both expert designers and non-expert designers are poorly calibrated and overconfident. Nonetheless, expert designers are better calibrated when designing products for a foreign market than for their home market. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.","Zhang, D",Strategic,10.1111/caim.12142,,5.0,,10,5,WILEY,"The research focuses on understanding the transfer of design expertise across cultures to better compete in global markets, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",wos-prediction,60,20,Industrial Designers: Are You Ready for Foreign Markets?

"In this article, we explore how digital marketers think about marketing in the age of Big Data surveillance, automatic computational analyses, and algorithmic shaping of choice contexts. Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence. The vision of digital marketing is therefore a fascinating one: marketing disappears at precisely the moment when it extends throughout the life without limit. © The Author(s) 2020.",Darmody A.; Zwick D.,Strategic,10.1177/2053951720904112,algorithmic marketing; artificial intelligence; Big Data; consumer empowerment; digital marketing; hypernudging; manipulation; marketing automation; post-marketing; relevance; surveillance capitalism,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses the overarching implications of digital marketing in the context of Big Data and consumer empowerment, indicating a long-term perspective on marketing strategies and goals.",scopus-artificial intelligence,60,25,Manipulate to empower: Hyper-relevance and the contradictions of marketing in the age of surveillance capitalism,2020

"The optimal product design is an NP-hard marketing optimization problem, in which a firm aims at the maximization of its market share or profit. A manager that deals with the problem has to decide on a number of issues, such as how to simulate the consumer choice process, which optimization algorithm to apply, and how to model the competitors' retaliatory moves. The existing information systems fail to provide the decision maker with the unique blend of techniques and resources required by the problem. In order to follow the way that marketing managers comprehend the optimal product process, in this paper the problem is broken down into distinct services, each one of them maps into a basic feature (simulation, optimization, competition analysis, etc.). All services are aggregated to a marketing decision support system by a service oriented architecture, achieving this way a decision-makers friendly environment, since the marketing managers are able to get a solution without the need to transfer data and parameters from one software to another, and without the need to coordinate manually the whole process.

"Data mining involves extracting interesting patterns from data and can be found at the heart of operational research (OR), as its aim is to create and enhance decision support systems. Even in the early days, some data mining approaches relied on traditional OR methods such as linear programming and forecasting, and modern data mining methods are based on a wide variety of OR methods including linear and quadratic optimization, genetic algorithms and concepts based on artificial ant colonies. The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance.

"Enterprises comprise several functions, such as production, marketing, sales, human resources, logistics, safety and environment, which interact with each other. As a result, decision-making becomes highly challenging in the alignment of decisions to support the success of business goals. Specifically, environmental management is closely related to several levels in the enterprise structure, since they share a large amount of data and information. Hence, effective integration of environmental issues by means of tools improving information sharing and communication, may play a crucial role for the enhanced enterprise operation from an environmental perspective. In this sense, knowledge management technologies have proved to be highly promising for supporting this integration task. In this work, an ontological framework is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models sharing for the environmental assessment of the enterprise. The ontological model is applied to a case study considering a supply chain network design-planning and a process scheduling problem.

"Today, extensive quantitative modelling of the performance of marketing activities is possible due to the availability of rich data sets on product sales and related marketing actions. However, there are a number of product categories for which only inaccurate sales figures or data about marketing efforts exist (e.g., because a significant part of the sales is realized in stores without scanners or which do not make the data available to firm outsiders). In such cases, reliable quantitative findings about the impact of marketing-mix variables on sales may not be achievable but qualitative reasoning may, at least, indicate likely implications of past or planned marketing activities in terms of directions of change. Even in markets with good data qualitative reasoning may be a worthwhile first modelling approach when market conditions change so significantly that a previously used model is deemed unsatisfactory and not enough data exist yet for a specification of a revised quantitative model. We show specifically how qualitative reasoning can be used to diagnose and predict market share changes.

"This case study uses two story-telling methods for analysis – an advanced hermeneutic framework and an extended form of decision systems analysis (DSA) incorporating cognitive mapping – to explore the strategic thought in building a software house around a philosophy of “best practice” application development. The paper explores decision-making for turning an ambitious vision (automation of enterprise-based sales and marketing activities) into a focused application (pricing configuration software), and then into a large software house (Trilogy) offering enterprise e-commerce suites. Trilogy’s management team’s decision-making was heavily influenced by a strong perception that the organization needed to take risks to achieve “critical mass” in anticipation of a convergence of “back-office” and “front-office” applications into one market. The advanced case study also addresses Trilogy’s transition of its applications into Internet environments, plus the transformation of the organization from a product-orientation to a strictly industry-based business and application development perspective.

"Emerging technologies and services stand poised to transform the transportation system, with large implications for energy use and mobility. The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women's preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Spurlock C.A.; Sears J.; Wong-Parodi G.; Walker V.; Jin L.; Taylor M.; Duvall A.; Gopal A.; Todd A.,Strategic,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.014,Automated vehicles; Car-sharing; Electric vehicles; Ride-hailing; Technology adoption; Transportation decisions,5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of emerging technologies on transportation systems, including factors influencing adoption patterns and potential market growth, which align with strategic planning.",scopus-automation,60,20,"Describing the users: Understanding adoption of and interest in shared, electrified, and automated transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area",2019
"This article considers the link between the increasingly important role of automated information curation online and the rise of what we call ‘commercial populism’. We invoke the term to refer to the convergence of populism as a marketing tool–a way of selling, for example, nutritional supplements or survivalist merchandise–with political strategies that cater to the citizen as consumer (whose freedoms are framed in the individual register of personal taste unfettered from civic concerns or constraints). Perhaps unsurprisingly in this context, we draw on the example of Donald Trump's political rise, which while not unrelated to his particular idiosyncrasies, demonstrates how the automated curation of social media aligns itself with what the aggressive rise of commercial populism. The goal of such an analysis is to consider how the combination of hyper-commercialism with the formal attributes of social media contributes to inter-related political pathologies of polarization and conspiracy theory. The consumer-oriented model of personal taste catered to by algorithmic curation highlights the paradox of ‘social’ media: they promise to enhance the social by displacing or reframing it fundamental a-social.

"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers. Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs.

"Building from related interdisciplinary theories, this research identifies social influence–related variables that are linked to customer relationship management (CRM) technology utilization within an international business-to-business field sales force. Field sales employees (n = 147) in a multinational organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were surveyed to test the research model. Four of 7 primary hypotheses were supported, predicting more than 65% of the variance in the research model. Effort expectancy, uncertainty avoidance, collective performance expectancy, and internal/organizational social influence all showed antecedent significance to contextual utilization of CRM technology. The results of this study suggest that group-oriented individual decision making and the related concept of institutional collectivism are equally as important as individual-oriented decision making in the international utilization of organizational technology. Based on the strong significance shown in the results of this study, it would also be wise to consider cultural value–derived uncertainty avoidance in practical development of training and implementation of multinational CRM systems. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Baker D.S.,Strategic,10.1080/15332667.2014.965650,culture; customer relationship management; international; marketing; normative; sales; sales force automation; social influence; technology acceptance; technology utilization,5.0,,10,0,Routledge,"The research focuses on understanding social influence variables in CRM technology utilization, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and the nature of business relationships in an international context.",scopus-automation,70,15,Social Influence and Contextual Utilization of Customer Relationship Management Technology in an International Field Sales Organization,2014
"Despite the considerable attention being placed on the potential payoff's from programmable manufacturing technologies, remarkably little systematic research has been conducted on organizational plans, decisions, and associated actions. The 1982-83 factory automation surveys project of the Boston University Manufacturing Roundtable reported on here was designed to develop a broad managerial view of computer-aided manufacturing processes in the US. Our purpose was to create a body of information, drawn from the recent experience of leading-edge practitioners, that would begin to describe the range of behaviors accompanying the adoption and implementation of automation technologies, such as advanced numerical control, CAD/CAM and robots, which may be combined to form the ""factory of the future"". In short, we wanted to identify the kinds of progress being made by these manufacturers and the barriers that they, and those who are contemplating such process innovations, will face in the future. In each of our three surveys we had a specific target population in mind. The ""user"" survey was aimed at discrete-part manufacturing organizations that were leaders in adopting factory automation technologies. This survey was designed to address ""best practice"" at the level of a single strategic business unit and deals with specific automation projects. Our ""supplier"" survey was aimed at the major producers of each of the various factory automation technologies. Here we sought the observations and opinions of senior marketing executives in those firms with the most success (and therefore experience) in supplying computer-based manufacturing technologies. Finally, our ""expert"" survey was designed to test some of our preliminary findings from the users and suppliers, including insights gathered from in-depth follow-up telephone interviews with respondents to those two surveys. We intentionally tried to identify a broad sample of individuals whose views would be based on extensive factory automation experience in different capacities. Respondents to our three surveys consisted of 57 users, 38 suppliers and 64 experts. Findings from the three surveys form certain patterns that transcend the isolated facts commonly presented in the literature. The dominant impressions that emerged from the data were:. Leading-edge users of computer-aided manufacturing processes believe in learning by doing. Most have proceeded in an incremental fashion to develop an internal base of experience with factory automation technologies. They tend to have supportive management and a sense of where they are heading. Their current measurement capabilities, however, restrict the basis for making adoption decisions as well as the subsequent evaluation of impacts from recent technological innovations. These users usually rely heavily on outside suppliers for critical technical assistance and consider reliability factors to be more important than price in selecting a vendor. They generally feel they cannot afford to postpone decisions until improved technologies become available. Current leadingedge users will strongly affect the future direction of these technologies. Suppliers claim that most manufacturers are not sophisticated customers. They would like potential users to be more aware of their needs for improved manufacturing processes and to be more interested in the long-term strategic benefits of computer-aided manufacturing technologies already on the market. A classic dilemma seems to have arisen: decisions to adopt expensive factory automation technologies are often made by managers who lack the background to assess technological options, while staff familiar with the new technologies are less able to appreciate associated strategic dimensions. A likely outcome is a decision that is either short-sighted or misguided. Suppliers with limited direct experience in new applications of their technologies and little indepth knowledge of the business situations of their customers cannot be expected to help users avoid such errors. The most difficult problems in achieving computer integrated manufacturing are managerial rather than technical. Manufacturers contemplating factory automation face different issues depending on whether they adopt a retrofit strategy using existing production systems or whether they attempt to make a fresh start as new facilities are brought on stream. In either case, they often have inadequate internal technical resources, strong barriers to communication across traditional functional lines, and a reward structure that does not encourage risk-taking in the interest of long-term strategic gains. Manufacturing organizations that do not deal directly with these kinds of managerial problems are not likely to succeed in factory automation, even if appropriate technological options exist. These functions suggest that manufacturing managers ought to reflect on their organization's current strengths and weaknesses as they formulate a strategy for factory automation. In particular, they should begin with a healthy concern for the adequacy of their current base of knowledge, mix of human resources and formal measurement systems. They should also refine their expectations for integrated factory automation applications, to be sure that general goals such as ""enhanced flexibility"" have explicit operational meanings. Finally, they should improve their organization's ability to identify types of indirect costs, as well as benefits, that are implicit in such goals. These prescriptions apply to manufacturers just beginning to adopt programmable manufacturing technologies, as well as to those who are well along this path. Further in-depth research is needed if the progress being made by leading-edge users is to serve as a basis for more widespread attempts to move toward the ""factory of the future"". © 1984.",Rosenthal S.R.,Strategic,10.1016/0272-6963(84)90012-3,,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses long-term organizational plans, decisions, and the overarching direction of adopting automation technologies in manufacturing.

"The supply chain ecosystem is currently benefiting from a great dynamic resulting from the digitalization of organizations and trades. For all the stakeholders in the area, this is a real breakthrough, and machine learning is at the core of this revolution. It has profoundly revolutionized companies in many aspects including the evolution of communication methods, the automation of many processes, the growing importance of information systems, etc. With shrinking margins and more demanding customers, supply chain management in increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage. Its management and optimization requires a factual to Supply Chain decision making at strategique, tactical and operational levels. In this context and data rich environment, machine learning approaches and techniques find numerous useful applications for supply chain decision making. Today, companies have no choice but to apply Machine Learning solutions in almost every part of their processes. This fact seems even clearer in markets where competition is fierce. While Machine Learning does not redefine the enterprise, it is certainly a powerful asset for both marketing and process optimization purposes. It is so ingrained in the strategies of companies that now most of them rely heavily on it for all processes from creation, to product quality control, to public relations. In recent years, a series of practical applications of machine learning (ML) for supply chain decisions have been introduced. By interconnecting the ML methods applied for SC decision making, this paper identifies current SC applications and indicates potential research gaps. In this paper, we examine the general usability of machine learning techniques to assist with supply chain decisions. The main objective of this research is therefore to study how machine learning techniques can be integrated into the range of tools available to supply chain decision makers in order to take advantage of the increasing volume of data generated in the supply chain. © 2022 Authors.

"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor-automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Rust R.T.; Huang M.-H.,Strategic,10.1509/jm.10.0441,Customer satisfaction; Financial impact; Marketing metrics; Self-service; Service productivity; Service quality; Technology,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the management of service productivity as a strategic decision variable aimed at maximizing profits, which aligns with long-term planning and defining organizational goals.",scopus-automation,70,10,Optimizing service productivity,2012

"Although it is often assumed that default rules affect change without awareness, this paper suggests that contrast with the default and transition into conscious adoption of the default design may be the starting point to establish long-term changes in consumer behavior. Despite the rooting of default rules in subconscious decision-making, this research finds that, ultimately, awareness drives the demand necessary for the creation of sustainable consumption. Whereas direct appeal to individuals has a disappointing level of influence on sustainability choices, it is understood that green consumers do come from somewhere. Green default rules offer interesting prospects for sidestepping the drawbacks of direct marketing to individuals. Under green default rules, behavior is guided by a default, such as utilities automatically sending customers renewables-sourced instead of fossil-fuel-based energy. To act otherwise requires additional effort and is less likely. Motivated by a need to understand how defaults might bridge standards and sustainable consumption, I investigate how organizational processes potentially lead from standardized green default rules to individual awareness that can spread and facilitate sustainable consumption. This paper examines the Active House sustainable building demonstrations in Europe in order to understand how (1) communications and market creation and (2) responsible, user-centered experimentation are organized to move from defaults to sustainable consumption. © 2018 by the authors.",Hale L.A.,Strategic,10.3390/su10010249,Automation; Default bias; Green default rules; Smart home; Standardization; Sustainable building; Sustainable consumption,5.0,,10,5,MDPI,"The abstract discusses long-term changes in consumer behavior, focusing on the transition from subconscious decision-making to conscious adoption of sustainable consumption practices.

"The subject of factory automation is a critical one for all business functions, with the potential of creating an entire upheaval in the fields of accounting, finance, marketing, general management, and most significantly, operations management. Totally new ways of managing a business are likely, but it is not yet clear what these ways may be. In spite of the tremendous implications of these new technologies, little research is being conducted in this area. A panel session exploring this topic was thus offered at the 1984 Toronto meeting of the American Institute for Decision Sciences. This article presents the results of that session. The intent of the article is to foster research interest in this area and identify the extensive opportunities available. The article reviews the extant literature concerning the management of factory automation and identifies the gaps in our knowledge where research is needed. Factory automation as defined here is intended to include the areas of both hard automation (CAD/CAM, robotics, FMS, etc.) and soft automation (such as MRP II, group technology, MAP, data networking). Research issues are divided into three major topic areas for ease of discussion: strategic issues, justification issues, and implementation issues. The strategic area encompasses the subjects of corporate strategy and its tie with manufacturing strategy, firm characteristics of leading-edge users of automation, the effect of learning and experience with automation, the concept of ""synergy"" among automation technologies, technology transfer, and implementation strategy. The justification issues are divided into benefit, cost, and risk aspects. The present inadequacy of economic justification techniques for automation systems and the pros and cons of alternative approaches are explored. The consideration of differing types of automation and their possible need for differing justification techniques is also discussed. For both benefits and costs, the quantification problem is a major issue, particularly with benefits believed to improve the effectiveness of operations, rather than their efficiency (a major advantage of the automation technologies, it is often claimed). Another major issue here is the pre- and postautomation comparison, requiring accurate and thorough manufacturing audit techniques. The risks in automation can be tremendous. Whether this can be reduced through incremental automation, or other approaches, is a very important question. The nature of the risks-technological, financial, sociological-is also an important subject for research, as well as methods to deal with each type. Topics in the implementation area include procedural aspects, human aspects, interface/infrastructure aspects, and measurement and reward aspects. In general, the nature of the automation implementation process, and its solution, is a critical research area that is confounded with multiple factors. There is a need for research to determine if such a thing as a ""best"" implementation path exists for specific technologies and firms. How does a firm know if it is ""ready"" for automation, and which automation technology to start with? The effect of automation on workers and management is an important research question. And in addition, what are the effects of these employees on the implementation process? And it will be necessary to know how jobs change under automation, for both line and staff. Research is also needed to determine how automation will affect the way the firm does business, how interdepartmental coordination will be affected, and whether there will even be departments. If automation is implemented piecemeal, can the pieces later be tied together? What will be the problems? Managers need to know if new measurement and reward systems will be needed for workers, or perhaps even more important, for the managers. Will incentives need to be increased, or changed in some other fashion, for managers to be willing to take the risks involved in automation? Last, some advice is given to the potential researcher in this area. Approaching this subject in a way that yields meaningful research, helpful to real managers currently struggling with these problems, is important since real firms are our primary research laboratories in this field. For example, case studies, interviews, surveys, and conceptual development are important early tools in this area compared to the traditional model building and analysis techniques that have historically characterized operations management. © 1986.",Meredith J.; Hyer N.L.; Gerwin D.; Rosenthal S.R.; Wemmerlöv U.,Strategic,10.1016/0272-6963(86)90025-2,,15.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of factory automation on various business functions, emphasizing the need for new strategic approaches and understanding the gaps in knowledge that require research.

"Purpose: Few studies have conceptualized how companies can build and nurture international dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMCs) by implementing growth hacking strategies. This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to craft a future research agenda to advance smart service research and practice. Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on discussions in the workshop on “Fresh perspectives on technology in service” at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings – We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value – Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored.

The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency. Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard. © 2023 The Authors",Khalid Khan S.; Shiwakoti N.; Stasinopoulos P.; Warren M.,Strategic,10.1016/j.aap.2023.107054,Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical system; Driverless cars; Governance; Laws,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the development of a dynamic modelling tool for analyzing cybersecurity regulations in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), focusing on long-term implications and stakeholder integration, which aligns closely with strategic planning.",scopus-autonomous,70,15,Modelling cybersecurity regulations for automated vehicles,2023
"Reputation is critical for building relationships with business customers in the global marketplace. However, in structurally connected organization configurations, the literature focuses mainly on one of the functional unit's reputations (either subordinate or superordinate organization), leaving out the interplay of reputation among various units in the organization. Drawing on identity and categorization theories, we develop a framework to examine the effects of brand reputation at both levels. Our study context is higher education, where business schools (subordinate) operate as autonomous entities globally yet are dependent on universities (superordinate) for policy decisions. We specify a random effects model on a 10-year panel dataset of 193 business schools to account for unobserved heterogeneity, potential selection bias, and endogeneity of reputation. Our findings suggest that brand reputation attributes at the subordinate and superordinate levels both individually and synergistically affect subordinate funding outcomes (i.e., business-school endowment). Furthermore, subordinate-level resource-utilization signals, such as diversification strategies and top executives' backgrounds, and superordinate-level policy signals, such as organization ownership and inclusivity, inform donor decisions and moderate the reputation–funding relationship. Our study suggests that administrators and managers should consider donor identity salience in marketing efforts. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Anand A.; Kumar V.; Lahiri A.,Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.11.009,Brand identity salience; Categorization theory; Higher education; Information signals; Organizational reputation,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the interplay of reputation among different organizational levels, specifically in the context of higher education, which aligns with long-term strategic goals and the overall nature of organizational identity and funding outcomes.",scopus-autonomous,70,15,Categorization of organizational reputation and subordinate organizations' global funding outcome: A higher education perspective,2024
"As a mature tourism destination, the Balearic Islands suffer the normal effects of the stagnation stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC) model. During stagnation, reorientation policies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of those effects in order to reduce the prevalence of seasonality. Various planning instruments have been designed and implemented by successive local governments, a key priority being the attempt to find a strategic answer to reducing this phenomenon. Based on the analysis of successive marketing plans of the Autonomous Region of the Balearic Islands, and using the Gini index to measure seasonality, this study explores the link between the two and demonstrates that regional political policies adopted over the last 20 years have not reduced seasonal variation in tourism. The demand remains at the same levels of seasonality as in the 1990s, suggesting the ineffectiveness of the policies implemented.",Sastre M.A.G.; Hormaeche M.A.; Villar M.T.,Strategic,10.5367/te.2015.0519,Balearic Islands.; Marketing plan; Seasonality; Tourism destination,5.0,,10,5,University of London,"The abstract discusses long-term tourism strategies and policies aimed at addressing the stagnation and seasonality issues in the Balearic Islands, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-autonomous,60,20,Are regional political decisions the key element in reducing seasonal variation in tourism? the case of the Balearic Islands,2015
"Food managers are engaged in altering the nutritional quality of diets. They do so directly through product innovation strategies (food manufacturers) and the selection of products available in stores (grocers and restaurants) and indirectly through distribution and promotion strategies and prices. Decisions to alter products, menus, assortments and marketing strategies are drivers of supply, which interact with consumer demand to impact the nutritional quality of food available, purchased and eventually consumed. The sequence of managerial decisions leading to product-level marketing mixes is explored.

"Many contemporary markets, particularly markets of information technology products and information services, are characterized by increasing returns, including those resulting from bandwagon and network effects. At the same time, in larger firms, innovation often takes place in distinct units that are semi-autonomous and that have the responsibility for more than one phase in the product development process. In the most extreme case, a separate profit center is created within which research and development (R&D), production, marketing, and related activities are fully integrated and that has its own responsibility for external relations: an internal innovative venture. The central issue in this paper is the relation between the way firms organize their innovative activities and the market dynamics caused by bandwagon and network effects. We focus on the decision-making actors and we propose a categorization of causes of increasing returns and definitions of bandwagon and network effects that are consistent with this aim. We investigate the extent of internal autonomy of the unit, the extent of the integration of R&D, marketing and other activities in the product development process, and the extent of external autonomy. Three cases of projects creating software products, two of them in the same firm, demonstrate that the organization of innovation and the dynamics of the market are mutually dependent. More in particular, we hold that higher autonomy of teams, particularly in managing external relations, is important to cope with and manage bandwagon and network effects.",Van Den Ende J.; Wijnberg N.,Strategic,10.1109/TEM.2003.817286,Autonomy of project teams; Bandwagon effects; Increasing returns; Network effects; Organization of innovation,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the organization of innovative activities within firms and their relationship with market dynamics, focusing on long-term implications and decision-making actors, which aligns with strategic considerations.",scopus-autonomous,60,20,The organization of innovation and market dynamics: Managing increasing returns in software firms,2003
"This paper models autonomous ridesharing — multiple travelers simultaneously riding one shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) — in a network equilibrium setting with mixed SAV and human-driven vehicle (HV) traffic. We make two major methodological contributions. First, a novel one (SAV)-to-many (riders) matching is proposed to characterize the waiting times of an SAV and multiple travelers who share rides in the SAV during online matching, which is a nontrivial generalization of the one-to-one matching without ridesharing. Our matching characterization considers the possibilities of a traveler matched with an SAV starting from the same origin, whereto the SAV moved unoccupied as a result of either pickup or relocation, or with an in-service SAV that goes through the traveler's origin. Second, a section-based formulation for SAV ridesharing user equilibrium is introduced to characterize the SAV traveler flow, which accommodates the possibility that an SAV traveler's itinerary (OD pair) is different from that of the serving SAV and other travelers in the SAV. Unlike the existing link and route based ridesharing formulations, the notion of section both prevents undesired traveler en-route transfer(s) and allows travelers of multiple ODs to share rides, meanwhile respecting the SAV seat capacity constraint. In addition to the above two methodological contributions, the optimal SAV fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation (to in-service, pickup, and relocation states) decisions of a transportation network company (TNC) are formulated. The TNC decisions anticipate traveler reactions as characterized by a new multimodal autonomous ridesharing user equilibrium (MARUE), which is put forward with a proof of its existence and finds the endogenous market shares and road congestion effects of SAV/HV. Original insights are obtained from model implementation, including substantial systemwide benefit of ridesharing, marginal benefit of relocation in the presence of ridesharing, and diminishing economies of SAV size. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Noruzoliaee M.; Zou B.,Strategic,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.002,Endogenous market share; Network congestion; One-to-many matching; Section-based ridesharing equilibrium; Shared autonomous vehicle,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract focuses on modeling autonomous ridesharing and includes long-term implications for fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation decisions, which are strategic in nature.

"In the 21st century, facing with increasingly severe resource shortages and environmental pollution problems, the public has begun to change consumption concept and support green consumption actions initiated by the government and companies. Since the trade-in subsidy policy provided by government was canceled, companies have implemented trade-in on their own. As a method of competition, marketing strategy research pays more and more attention to trade-in, which shows many advantages such as benefiting the people, stimulating consumption and upgrading products. Currently, the studies of trade-in mainly focus on discussing the superiority when it is carried out by a single enterprise. The current study seldom analyzes trade-in systematically from supply chain perspective when it is implemented by different investors. In addition, whether an old customer buys a new product depends on the previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products. Existing studies have not considered the purchase decision characteristics of old customers. In this paper, the market is divided into two parts. One market is the new customer, and the other one is the old customer. The previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products are considered as two important factors when an old customer purchases a new product. This paper is based on the two-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer and a manufacturer. Trade-in policy implemented by retailer and manufacturer is constructed by considering customer utility to study strategic optimization of supply chain system. Firstly, decision-makings of supply chains of three strategic models are compared and analyzed to study their impact on customers. Secondly, the optimal path of supply chain strategy is provided and discussed from the perspective of business efficiency. Thirdly, the impact of market factors on supply chain efficiency of the optimal path adopted in the supply chain is discussed. Finally, by comparing consumer surpluses and social welfares of the three strategies, the social advantages of the adopted optimal path are studied. This study has four major research findings. First, trade-in strategy has a significant impact on product sales and corporate profits. The manufacturer or retailer can strive for greater profit by investing trade-in on his own initiative than before. That will be an obstacle to implementing trade-in strategy. Therefore, when making decisions the manufacturer should properly pay regard to the retailer, and then select a reasonable strategy according to the relationship between them, such as investing trade-in cooperatively. Second, whichever trade-in strategy is adopted in the market, external market (namely retail price, buy-back price, market demand and customer net utility remain stable. However, internal system (namely wholesale price) is obviously dependent on the investor. Third, trade-in strategy is difficult to benefit all parties under market segments. When it is beneficial to one side, it is bound to harm the other side. When the repurchase desire of old customer for a new product is small, the trade-in strategy can effectively strengthen the product stickiness of old customer; however, it can weaken the product's appeal to potential new customer. Fourth, in some cases trade-in strategy will reduce overall consumer surplus and total social welfare. Only when the old customer’s market share, the previous usage experience or the depreciation of old product is higher than a certain threshold, it can benefit all consumers and the society © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",Hong-Yuan L.; Bo Y.; Yan-Ping L.,Strategic,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2019.01.016,Consumer utility; Social welfare; Strategy optimization; Supply chain; Trade-In,5.0,,10,5,Zhejiang University,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of trade-in strategies within a supply chain context, focusing on optimizing business efficiency and the impact on customer behavior, aligning with strategic planning that defines organizational goals.",scopus-autonomous,60,20,Strategy optimization of autonomous trade-in in the supply chain with considering consumer utility; [考虑消费者效用的供应链自主以旧换新策略优化],2019
"Multiple channel retailing and channel selection strategy have become key issues for many corporations to place themselves at the heart of a new era of retailing. This paper studies a triple-channel system in which a manufacturer operates a conventional channel, a direct online channel, as well as increases its online presence with an online shopping platform. It also takes the heterogeneity of consumers’ price sensitivity and channel preferences into account. It highlights that the perceived risks and perceived benefits are aggregated into an inhibitor or activator entering the customers’ acceptance of triple channels and further affecting their purchasing decisions. Three cases are discussed to investigate the demand distributions, the profit behaviours, the optimal pricing strategies and the channel selection strategies. Theoretical analysis is further validated by a case study with the aid of agent-based modelling. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that two acceptance indices – respectively, regarded as the consumers’ willingness to tolerate the perceived risks of the online channel and approve the perceived benefits from the third-party online platform – significantly govern the total profit in two stylised scenarios. This study schematically characterises the structure of demand distributions, helps the corporation to discern consumers’ channel choices and then focus its marketing efforts towards more profitable customers and strategic channel structures. Furthermore, some implications are outlined for the optimal supply chain designation decision. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Zhang W.-G.; Zhang Q.; Mizgier K.J.; Zhang Y.,Strategic,10.1080/00207543.2017.1336679,Agent-based simulation; Heterogeneous valuation; Multi-channel retailing; Perceived risk; Supply chain design,5.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a triple-channel retailing system and highlights the importance of understanding consumer behavior, pricing strategies, and channel selection, which are all aligned with long-term strategic planning for a corporation.",scopus-autonomous,60,25,Integrating the customers’ perceived risks and benefits into the triple-channel retailing,2017
"Destination management is an important competitive marketing method for global tourism destinations. Especially, when cooperated with image and brand management, it helps destinations to stand out from today's severe crowd of competition. The successful and efficient destination management companies usually play a major role in marketing their destinations, but there exists a conflict in literature on the level of involvement in related marketing activities. Though managing an autonomous organization having its' own budget and freedom in decision making seems to be the best solution to meet the rapidly changing trends and needs of global tourists, it needs to be analyzed within the organizations' managerial level. The aim of this article is to determine the perspectives of DMO managers from the most important two destinations in Turkey, which is a very popular country that is usually in the first 10 in the international tourism market. The destinations chosen are Istanbul and Izmir, which by using destination management within the last 10 years were able to become popular global brands in the world market by increasing their share rapidly. © 2010 Cognizant Comm.

"Purpose: Retailing in India is an unchartered territory. Food and grocery is the most promising area for setting up retail business in India. An understanding of shopper retail format choice behaviour will enable retailers to segment their market and target specific consumer groups with strategies premeditated to meet their retail needs. The purpose of this paper is to make a detailed study on the effect of shoppers' demographic, geographic and psychographic dimensions in terms of format choice behaviour in the fast growing Indian food and grocery retailing. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research design is adopted applying mall intercept survey method using structured questionnaire for data collection. Both descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistical tools like χ2, factor analysis and multivariate analysis are used to analyse the data collected from 1,040 food and grocery retail customers from upgraded neighbourhood kirana stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets in conjoint cities of Secunderabad and Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh in India. Findings: The findings suggest that shoppers' age, gender, occupation, education, monthly household income, family size and distance travelled to store have significant association with retail format choice decisions. The choice decisions are also varied among shoppers' demographic attributes. The findings from shoppers' psychographic dimensions like values, lifestyle factors and shopping orientations resulted in segmentation of food and grocery retail consumers into hedonic, utilitarian, autonomous, conventional and socialization type. Practical implications: The study has practical implications for food and grocery retailers for better understanding the shopper behaviour in the context of changing consumer demographic and psychographic characteristics in an emerging Indian retail market. The findings may help the retailers to segment and target the food and grocery retail consumers and, as a consequence, to undertake more effective retail marketing strategies for competitive advantage. Originality/value: Given the absence of published academic literature and empirical findings relating to store format choice behaviour in food and grocery retailing in India, this study may serve as a departure point for future studies in this area of concern.

"The role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is recognized globally given their contribution to total productivity and job opportunities. However, the majority of SMEs tend to fail due to a lack of marketing knowledge and managerial skills or technical expertise. Professional accountants are in a unique situation to help SME owner/managers to achieve their business objectives and bridge the skills gap. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the factors that affect the decisions of owner/managers of SMEs in Iranian manufacturing sector to utilise the professional accountants' advisory services and to examine the impact of these advisory services on SME performance using the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm. Based on a questionnaire survey data of 658 Iranian manufacturing SMEs, our regression analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services and three independent variables, namely, knowledge of owner/manager, competitive intensity and complexity of marketing decisions. Furthermore, we evidence that the use of advisory services is significant and positively associated with SME performance. More importantly, utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services partially mediates the relationship between knowledge of owner/manager, competitive intensity and complexity of marketing decisions and firm performance. Therefore, we provide a specific, theoretically and empirically grounded prediction of how utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services influences performance with implications for theory and practice.","Kamyabi, Y; Devi, S",Strategic,10.4102/sajbm.v43i2.184,,5.0,,10,5,AOSIS,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of utilizing professional accountants' advisory services in SMEs, aiming to identify factors affecting management decisions and their overall performance.

"Historically, neither the creators nor the distributors of cultural products such as books or movies have used analytics - data, statistics, predictive modeling - to determine the likely success of their offerings. Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation.

"Purpose - The frequency and sophistication of consumer boycotts continue to increase from already high levels. Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study I show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers.","Ettenson, R; Klein, JG",Strategic,10.1108/02651330510593278,international business; consumer behaviour; brands,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,"The abstract discusses a long-term consumer boycott and its implications for managerial decisions, focusing on a strategic analysis of consumer behavior and the animosity model, which aligns with long-term organizational goals.",wos-prediction,60,20,The fallout from French nuclear testing in the South Pacific - A longitudinal study of consumer boycotts,2005

"The institutional appeal implications of organizational strategy decisions to hold firm or to adapt on key tactical factors are analyzed in a cross-sectional analysis of the top 100 Liberal Arts Colleges, compared against a similar analysis of the top 100 Research Universities in the United States. This analysis is motivated by the well-documented declining student interest in Liberal Arts Colleges. Building on theory related to the benefits of identifying, maintaining and emphasizing one's own core organizational identity, Liberal Art Colleges are predicted to experience increased institutional appeal from pursuing such a strategy. Practically, this prediction implies that the predominant industry practice of Liberal Arts Colleges to consistently evolve and change form in response to their shifting environments may be misguided and thus detrimental to the long-term viability of the institution. Evidence is found for significant advantages to holding firm on certain aspects of the Liberal Arts College identity.

"The prevalent multichannel shopping environment is driving many consumers to choose between online and offline channel at the information search and product purchase stages of a shopping experience. Consequently, multichannel retailers face the challenges of identifying different target consumer groups and maximizing the value of each channel by understanding and serving each group more effectively. Hence, this study attempts to identify consumer segments by examining consumers' perceived channel values at different shopping stages. The latent class MNL (LC-MNL) method, as a powerful tool that is able to detect consumer heterogeneity in the same consumption scenarios, is applied to conduct consumer segmentation analysis based on the consumer's perceived values, including channel benefits and costs, as well as different channels' characteristics. By using the survey data of 1325 consumers, results indicate two segments comprising innovative consumers and conventional consumers in terms of online vs. offline channel usage. Furthermore, the logit regressions for segments estimation illustrate that the two segments are significantly different in terms of channel attributes and consumers' intrinsic channel preferences. This study contributes to the extant electronic commerce and multichannel marketing literature by designing a rigorous consumer segmentation method which incorporates both interpretation and prediction capabilities and analyzing the underlying influential factors for different segments. The results can further provide useful guidance to marketing and sales practitioners in designing effective channel attributes to meet the needs of consumers belonging to different segments.","Wang, QS; Yang, X; Song, PJ; Sia, CL",Strategic,,Multichannel and multistage shopping; Consumer segmentation; Perceived channel value; Latent class MNL approach,5.0,,10,0,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV,The study focuses on long-term consumer segmentation strategies for multichannel retailers by identifying distinct consumer groups based on their perceived values and preferences.

"Accelerating antiglobalization challenges previously undisputed assumptions about the importance of a product's globalness/localness in purchase decisions. Putting these assumptions to test, this article conceptualizes globalness/localness as a distinct product attribute and decomposes its utility into weight and preference components. Subsequently, it offers an equity-theory-based prediction of the attribute's declining relevance/trivialization and quantifies its trade-offs with other attributes by calculating global/local price premiums. Conjoint experiments in two countries (Austria and India) reveal that (1) emerging- (developed-) market consumers exhibit relative preference for global (local) products, (2) emerging-market consumers perceive higher preference inequity between global and local products than developed-market consumers, and (3) the corresponding inequity triggers consumers' cognitive inequity regulation (manifested through attribute trivialization in developed markets) and behavioral inequity regulation (manifested through asymmetrical willingness to pay for global/local products across developed/emerging markets).

"Global marketing status shows that over 120 million bikes are being produced around the world yearly. Taiwan applied a cross-strait division of labor to manufacture about 30 million bikes in 2009. Since many study applied forecasts are basic inputs for many kinds of decisions and policy in business and government. This paper proposed a novel nonlinear forecasting model, known as Taguchi-differential evolution algorithm grey forecasting model (1,1) (TDEGM(1,1)). The TDEGM(1,1) is validated using integrated circuit and bike industry forecasting as study cases. Furthermore, the mean absolute percentage error is used to compare the performance of the forecasted models. The TDEGM(1,1) was the most accurate one among these models which are original GM(1,1), the Bayesian GM(1,1) and genetic algorithms GM(1,1). Meanwhile, the convergence result of TDEGM(1,1) is proved faster than genetic algorithms-based GM(1,1) and Bayesian GM(1,1).

"In the last few decades, scholars and practitioners have increasingly tried to understand the factors that influence technology acceptance. Theories and models developed by scholars have tended to focus on the role of cognition and have rarely included affect. The few studies that have incorporated affect have tended to measure a single emotion rather than modeling it comprehensively. This research addresses that inadequacy in our understanding of technology adoption by merging two previously unrelated models: TAM (the Technology Acceptance Model) and PAD (the Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance paradigm of affect). This study also examines an enhanced view of cognition. The product of this unified theoretical framework is referred to as the Consumer Acceptance of Technology (CAT) model. The results of a test using structural equation modeling provide empirical support for the model. Overall, the CAT model explains over 50% of the variance in consumer adoption intentions, a considerable increase compared to TAM. These findings suggest that substantial improvement in the prediction of technology adoption decisions is possible by use of this model with its integration of affect and cognition.

"This paper tests a theory of strategic multi-product choice (SMPC) using empirical evidence from a large-scale choice experiment, two smaller longitudinal choice experiments, and multi-market panel data. Multi-product choice involves two stages. In the first stage, the consumer chooses a set of substitutable products, where set refers to both the variety of alternatives and the quantities of each. In the second stage, the set is consumed. Assuming consumers are strategic, their consumption decisions will consider both the utility of whichever product is selected for consumption and the expected utility (i.e., value) of the set that remains. SMPC therefore requires a dynamic model. We test two such dynamic models in this paper. These models are derived from a basic random utility framework with a stochastic error term for the utility of each product alternative at the moment of consumption. Despite maintaining state variables for the quantity of every alternative, these SMPC dynamic models offer both a value function and optimal consumption policy in closed form. These structures allow us to test for strategic consumption in the second stage and for optimality of the choice sets selected in the first stage. Data from the large-scale choice experiment and the smaller longitudinal choice experiments support strategic consumer decision-making, consistent with SMPC theory. SMPC theory further predicts that the amount of variety consumers select will be higher for lower consumption rates and lower for higher consumption rates. Evidence from panel data of yogurt purchases supports this prediction. While we find that consumption choices are consistent with SMPC theory, they are not consistent with alternative explanations such as variety seeking or diversification bias. Viewed in its entirety, the empirical evidence presented in this paper confirms that both the choice set selected and the way it is consumed are consistent with dynamic models of future preference uncertainty.","Fox, EJ; Pulgar, H; Semple, JH",Strategic,10.1007/s11129-024-09280-5,Multi-product choice; Dynamic programming; Discrete choice modeling; M310,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a theory related to strategic multi-product choice (SMPC) that involves long-term consumer decision-making and the implications of these choices on future consumption patterns.

"Purpose This paper aims to attempt to examine the effect of firm-customer exchange characteristics, frequency and specificity, on the likelihood of the firm to generate customer-driven innovation. The authors draw from social capital theory and argue that repetitive and customer-specific exchange improves the trusts between firm and customers, which in turn ease the flows of tacit knowledge from customers to the firm. From the perspective of customer knowledge management, the authors contribute by examining the mechanism by which a firm can acquire knowledge from and about customers. The authors further argue that a firm's ability to absorb knowledge from customers and turn them into innovation also depends on its internal capability. A firm that consistently upgrades its capacity is more likely to generate customer-driven innovation than those that do not. Also, the authors argue that the joint effect of exchange characteristics and internal capability upgrading can further increase the likelihood of customer-driven innovation. Such a joint force implies the positive moderating effect of internal capability upgrading to the relationship between exchange characteristics and customer-driven innovation. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the hypotheses on 3,000 firms from six countries in Latin America. They take advantage of the 2017 World Bank Enterprises Survey. This most recent of the survey asks questions on various types of innovation and firm-customers exchange characteristics and other firm-level variables. Findings The authors find support for our hypotheses that repeated exchange and exchanges tailored to specific customers have a positive effect on customer-driven innovation. Also, they find the support that internal capability upgrading, in the form of investment in product design, marketing and organizational development has a positive effect on customer-driven innovation. The authors also find that investment in product design positively moderates the impact of exchange characteristics on the likelihood of customer-driven innovation. Originality/value While past studies focus on strategies to acquire and manage customers' knowledge, little has been said about how exchange attributes can encourage or discourage innovation? This question is important because various theoretical perspectives may have a different prediction on the effect of firm-customer relationship and innovation. This study attempts to bridge such theoretical tension.","Nuruzzaman, N; Singh, D",Strategic,10.1108/JKM-07-2018-0447,Knowledge management; Resources and capabilities; Innovation performance; Customer driven innovation; Exchange relationships,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of firm-customer exchange characteristics on customer-driven innovation, which aligns with strategic planning and goal definition for organizations.",wos-prediction,70,20,"Exchange characteristics, capability upgrading and innovation performance: evidence from Latin America",2019
"What drives the behavior of consumers when faced with a product-related crisis, such as that involving food contamination or life-threatening design flaws? For both consumers and companies, these crises have become of increasing importance because of the globalization of markets and an increased coverage by the media. Marketers need to understand why and how consumers react to a crisis. We show that by decoupling risk response behavior of consumers into the separate components of risk perception and risk attitude, a more robust conceptualization and prediction of consumers' reactions is possible. Such a framework helps provide answers on how marketers can deal with such types of crises. The merits of this conceptualization are illustrated in two field studies that examine the reactions of German, Dutch, and American consumers to the BSE (mad cow disease) crisis.

"In the standard economic account of consumer behavior the cost of a purchase takes the form of a reduction in future utility when expenditures that otherwise could have been made are forgone. The reality of consumer hedonics is different. When people make purchases, they often experience an immediate pain of paying, which can undermine the pleasure derived from consumption. The ticking of the taxi meter, for example, reduces one's pleasure from the ride. We propose a double-entry mental accounting theory that describes the nature of these reciprocal interactions between the pleasure of consumption and the pain of paring and draws out their implications for consumer behavior and hedonics. A central assumption of the model, which we call prospective accounting, is that consumption that has already been paid for can be enjoyed as if it were free and that the pain associated with payments made prior to consumption (but not after) is buffered by thoughts of the benefits that the payments will finance. Another important concept is coupling, which refers to the degree to which consumption calls to mind thoughts of payment, and vice versa. Some financing methods, such as credit cards, tend to weaken coupling, whereas others, such as cash payment, produce tight coupling. Our model makes a variety of predictions that are at variance with economic formulations. Contrary to the standard prediction that people will finance purchases to minimize the present value of payments, our model predicts strong debt aversion-that they should prefer to prepay for consumption or to get paid for work after it is performed. Such pay-before sequences confer hedonic benefits because consumption can be enjoyed without thinking about the need to pay for it in the future. Likewise, when paring beforehand, the pain of paying is mitigated by thoughts of future consumption benefits. Contrary to the economic prediction that consumers should prefer to pay, at the margin, for what they consume, our model predicts that consumers will find it less painful to pay for, and hence will prefer, flat-rate pricing schemes such as unlimited Internet access at a fixed monthly price, even if it involves paying more for the same usage. Other predictions concern spending patterns with cash, charge, or credit cards, and preferences for the earmarking of purchases. We test these predictions in a series of surveys and in a conjoint-like analysis that pitted our double-entry mental accounting model against a standard discounting formulation and another benchmark that did not incorporate hedonic interactions between consumption and payments. Our model provides a better fit of the data for 60% of the subjects; the discounting formulation provides a better fit for only 29% of the subjects (even when allowing for positive and negative discount rates). The pain of paying, we argue, plays an important role in consumer self-regulation, but is hedonically costly. From a hedonic perspective the ideal situation is one in which payments are tightly coupled to consumption (so that paying evokes thoughts about the benefits being financed) but consumption is decoupled from payments (so that consumption does not evoke thoughts about payment). From an efficiency perspective, however, it is important for consumers to be aware of what they are paying for consumption. This creates a tension between hedonic efficiency and what we call decision efficiency. Various institutional arrangements, such as financing of public parks through taxes or usage fees, play into this tradeoff. A producer developing a pricing structure for their product or sen iee should be aware of these two conflicting objectives, and should try to devise a structure that reconciles them.","Prelec, D; Loewenstein, G",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.17.1.4,,5.0,,10,5,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses a theoretical framework (double-entry mental accounting theory) that has implications for consumer behavior and pricing strategies, indicating a long-term strategic approach to understanding consumer preferences and decision-making.",wos-prediction,60,20,The red and the black: Mental accounting of savings and debt,1998
"Manufacturers' returns policies are a common feature in the distribution of many products. The obvious rationale for returns policies is insurance. Practitioners, not surprisingly, have a different perspective and view returns as a cost of doing business. In this paper, we study the strategic effect of returns policies on retail competition and highlight its profitability implications for a manufacturer. The setting for our research is the distribution of products with uncertain demand, limited shelf lives, and retail competition. Our objective is to provide a better understanding of when manufacturers should adopt returns policies. The insights are obtained with a model based on the economics of strategy and decision making under uncertainty. We show that when retailing is competitive and there is no uncertainty in demand, a returns policy subtly induces retailers to compete more intensely. The provision of a returns policy reduces retail prices without affecting wholesale prices, thereby reducing retailer margins and improving manufacturer profitability. The intuition is that with a returns policy, Cournot-like levels of retail stocks cannot be sustained. Each retailer will order stocks so that it will not be constrained by stocks, and so, intensifying retail competition. When, however, demand is uncertain and there is a single retailer, a returns policy encourages the retailer to over-stock, and so decreases (upstream) manufacturer profits. While the provision of a returns policy leads to lower retail margins, the optimality of returns policy depends on the overall uncertainty and marginal cost. A returns policy reduces the dispersion in retail prices between the high and low states of demand and the range of retail prices in the returns case is contained within the range of retail prices for the no-returns case. In the general setting, when there are competing retailers and demand is uncertain, there is a trade-off for the manufacturer between the benefits (more intense retail competition) and the costs (excessive stocking) of a returns policy. We find that a manufacturer should accept returns when the marginal production cost is sufficiently low and demand uncertainty is not too great. To validate the results of our theory, we conduct an empirical test with data from a major U.S. retailer. The tests confirm our prediction that a returns policy intensifies retail competition and reduces retailer margins. Our theory and empirical test should interest practitioners and researchers in distribution, especially those concerned with managing retail competition.","Padmanabhan, V; Png, IPL",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.16.1.81,,10.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of manufacturers' returns policies on retail competition and profitability, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making under uncertainty.",wos-prediction,60,20,Manufacturer's returns policies and retail competition,1997
"Purpose-Business sustainability refers to the total effort of a company including its demand and supply chain networks to reduce the impact on the Earth's life-and eco-systems. The objective of this paper is to describe a business sustainability model based upon a case study of a European manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was applied describing the efforts of business sustainability in the demand and supply chain networks of a Norwegian office chair producer. It is based upon a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews with top executives of the company as well as observations and content analyses of internal and external documents about the company's efforts of business sustainability. Findings-The case study shows that business sustainability is not about doing just one thing, but that a multitude of simultaneous efforts (e.g. actors, resources and activities) should be in place. Furthermore, business sustainability is not only about a company's own business operations, but its whole demand and supply chain networks which need to be included and taken into consideration. Research limitations/implications-The case study in focus is limited to just one company's effort of business sustainability and its demand and supply chain networks. It provides a business sustainability model that offers opportunities for further research. Practical implications-Focusing on the corporate impact of the natural environment can be highly profitable. Business sustainability and by extension the carbon footprint of demand and supply chain networks is becoming a criterion in the decision-making process of customers across industries. Business sustainability is a concern to everybody in society as the indicatives of climate change and global warming become more evident and troublesome. No one can have missed the fact that the weather is becoming more extreme, causing damage around the globe. Originality/value-The authors argue that research into business sustainability needs at this stage of development to be inductive rather than deductive it may be an irreversible mistake to try to re-package existing theory into business sustainability, as climate change prediction and the poor condition of the Earth have not been fully understood or comprised in previous theory.","Hogevold, NM; Svensson, G",Strategic,10.1108/08858621211197001,Business model; Business sustainability; Carbon footprint; Network; Demand chain; Supply chain; Norway; Supply and demand,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,The abstract discusses a business sustainability model and emphasizes the long-term goals of incorporating sustainability into the entire demand and supply chain networks.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the influence of future anticipation toward the development of brand relationship which finally creates brand loyalty. Brand loyalty has fascinated a number of researchers to conduct studies for so many years; however, its relationship with future anticipation has remained untouched by academia. Design/methodology/approach This study proved the proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. The empirical approximated for the main-effects model and model goodness of fit indexes. The results signified a good fit of the data to our conceptual model in both samples. Findings The research shows that the influence of future anticipation is very essential in creating a brand relationship, autobiographical memory or even market performance and all in Asia; also Europe has similar significance with regard to this matter. Thus, it is important for companies to emphasize the importance of future anticipation and also delivers or informs it well to customers to create a positive perception in customers' mind. Originality/value Future anticipation concept is anchored in philosophy theory and psychology. With respect to the study objectives, the focus is on the perspective of time which refers to thought and attitude toward past, present and future. In exploring what kind of behavior is related with future, the authors views are based on the futurology, a concept from sociology that studies generalizations about the nature of prediction.

"Purpose - This study proposed and tested three comprehensive models of the usage intention of proximity mobile payment services after a government regulation, by integrating the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the norm-activation model (NAM). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of moral norms, merchant pro-activeness and perceived government regulation (demonetisation) on users' continuance intention of proximity mobile payment services. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 387 users of proximity mobile payment services in India were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. This study was carried out with shoppers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and New Delhi because of the diverse and large population of these cities. Findings - The results of this study indicated that: integrating the variables of NAM into the original TPB model enhanced the prediction effect; perceived demonetisation regulation exerted a direct determinant effect as well as moderate effect on continuance usage intention of mobile payment services; also, extended TPB model with perceived demonetisation regulation as moderator could satisfactorily predict the continuance usage intention.

"Purpose: The foremost objective of this study is to obtain segments/clusters of franchisors that are more likely to fail. A second aim is to evaluate the influence of the usual variables of the franchise contract on the solvency of franchises. Design/methodology/approach: This study set up a database with information collected from several Spanish franchising yearbooks and franchisors' websites to establish the census of Spanish franchisors. This article worked with a census of the franchises operating in Spain from 2001 to 2011. Latent class regression analysis is used. Findings: This research found four segments or classes of franchisors with regard to their failure pattern. In addition, this article defined the most influential variables in the franchisors' risk of failure. The relationships between the variables that define a franchise contract and the Z scores of Altman's model have been extracted. The dependent variable has been the Altman's Z model and the independent variables are those that define the franchise contract. Research implications: This methodology offers potential franchisees a new criterion for assessing the franchise chains they are investigating, taking into account their risk of failure. This allows franchisees to better highlight those franchisors that have a lower crash risk and avoid the damage incurred by the closure of the chain. The information provided for franchisees should be accessible, usable, and suitable to help franchisees to choose the best franchise systems in which to invest. This methodology is of course very useful for franchisors, because they can comprehend their financial situation and how they could manage the franchising variables in order to improve their solvency. Practical implications: All the segments are solvent, except Segment 3. The distinguishing feature of this segment is that over 64 percent of the firms are retailer chains. In addition, more than 20 percent of the franchises from our database are in financial danger, and this is the group where the number of service companies is lower. Originality/value: This research is unique in two ways. First, this study presents a new methodology in this field that allows researchers to use the historical-financial data of franchisors, and the information of the franchise contract to predict franchisor failure. Second, this article helps franchisees to make their own decisions on the basis of the franchisors' level of risk of failure. Third, this research offer a theoretical contribution about franchisor failure, this topic is scarcely treated by academic literature.","Rodríguez-Rad, CJ; Rondán-Cataluña, FJ; Macías-Molina, JA",Strategic,10.1080/1051712X.2018.1381416,Franchising; franchisor; failure; latent class regression; Altman's Z Model,5.0,,10,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The study focuses on understanding franchisor failure and developing a methodology that can inform long-term decisions for franchisees and franchisors alike.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedents of consumers' attitude towards, and intention to commit, digital piracy in Indonesia, a country with the world's fourth largest population and one of the highest digital piracy rates. This study explored the effects of six variables derived from the theory of planned behaviour, ethics theory, and deterrence theory on young consumers in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach - Using a convenience sampling approach, researchers hand delivered 400 questionnaires to undergraduate students at one large private university and one major public university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Findings - The results showed that consumers' intention to pirate digital products was strongly influenced by consumers' attitude towards digital piracy. Interestingly, fear of legal consequences and perceived likelihood of punishment were not significant predictors of consumers' attitude towards digital piracy. This suggests that the principles of deterrence theory have a limited impact on consumers' attitudes in Indonesia.

"In this paper we propose a mufti-criteria decision making support system, called a Feedback Based Diagnosis System (FBDS), to aid the marketing team of an e-commerce (EC) organisation in its activities. The FBDS database is composed of customers' satisfaction measures. These measures are related to the different services an EC offers to its customers. Thus, they constitute a mufti-criteria (MC) evaluation of EC performances. In the general framework of recommender systems, these available MC evaluations are considered as useful information for other customers to help them to objectively, rationally and exhaustively assess and compare the numerous ECs among the ones likely to meet their needs. Our FBDS is not concerned with improving or automating such a recommendation process for customers. Indeed, it is merely EC management team oriented. In fact, the MC feedback database is used to diagnose the EC health and improve its strategy. In the proposed FBDS, a possibilistic framework is combined with the multi criteria representation to capture the variability and the divergence of customers' evaluations w.r.t. each criterion. Then, an aggregation based on a weighted arithmetic mean (WAM) is proposed to obtain a synthetic appraisal of ECs. The WAM aggregation models the strategy agreed on by the EC management team. Computing the synthesis score of an EC consists in propagating the uncertainty related to its partial scores through the WAM. The possibilistic representation guarantees that no information is lost in the collective evaluation process by the consumers' community. However, diagnosis indicators are finally proposed to the marketing team to make the interpretation of some possibilistic results more comprehensive when necessary. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"The web-based comparison shopping agents (CSAs) or shopbots have emerged as important business intermediaries that provide decision support to both the shoppers and the merchants. The basic idea is to provide an easy access to both the price and non-price based competitive features to shoppers. The CSAs do not have an equivalent counterpart in the offline world and they have generated a significant amount of interest among researchers in economics, marketing, and information systems fields. There have been numerous studies on the CSAs in the contexts of price dispersion, consumer behavior, search costs, and recommender systems. The focus of this paper is to study the contemporary literature about the CSAs to analyze them in the context of decision support systems (DSS). In order to provide comprehensive decision support, a typical DSS should have four components: data, models, interfaces, and user specific customization. In this paper, this four component framework is used to synthesize the current research work in the context of DSS and to explore contemporary CSAs. The paper provides suggestions for improving the decision support aspect of the CSAs and proposes a research agenda for the CSA-based decision support systems.","Pathak, B",Strategic,,comparison shopping agents; CSA; shopbots; comparison shopping; decision support systems,5.0,,10,5,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV,"The abstract discusses the role of comparison shopping agents (CSAs) as decision support systems (DSS) and explores their contemporary literature, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and planning in the context of marketing and consumer behavior.",wos-recommendation,60,20,A SURVEY OF THE COMPARISON SHOPPING AGENT-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,2010
"As the Nigerian retail banks customers become more sophisticated, it is now very important that retail banks determine the factors that are important and relevant to the customers' retail bank choice decisions. By using a survey of retail bank customers, this study evaluates the relative importance attached to retail banks' choice criteria used by male and female customers in Nigeria. The results show that there are some differences in choice factors used by male and female customers in selecting a retail bank for patronage. The recommendation is that bank managers should take both female and male market segments into consideration when making retail bank strategic planning in order to become competitive. The findings can assist retail bank managers in refining their marketing strategies as a means of overcoming the intense competition that exists in the Nigerian banking system.","Omar, OE",Strategic,10.1007/s11628-008-0039-1,Nigerian bank customers; Male and female customers; Retail banking; Choice of retail banks,5.0,,10,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,The abstract discusses the importance of understanding customer preferences in retail banking and recommends that bank managers consider both male and female market segments in their strategic planning.

"Recent empirical data on online shopping suggests that consumers have the potential to make better quality decisions while shopping on the web. But whether such potential is being realized by most consumers is an unresolved matter. Hence, the purpose of this research is to understand how (1) certain features of electronic environments have a favorable effect on the abilities of consumers to make better decisions, and (2) identify information-processing strategies that would enable consumers to make better quality decisions while shopping online. A cross-disciplinary theoretical analysis based on constructs drawn from economics (e.g., time costs), computing (e.g., recommendation agents), and psychology (e.g., decision strategies) is conducted to identify factors that potentially influence decision quality in electronic environments. The research is important from a theoretical standpoint because it examines an important aspect of online consumer decision making, namely, the impact of the electronic environment on the capabilities of consumers. It is important from both a managerial and public policy standpoint because the ability of shoppers to make better quality decisions while shopping online is directly related to improving market efficiency and enhancing consumer welfare in electronic markets.","Punj, G",Strategic,10.1002/mar.20564,,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The research focuses on understanding the long-term implications of electronic environments on consumer decision-making, aiming to improve market efficiency and enhance consumer welfare.

"We study how an online marketplace's personalized product recommendations and its consumer profiling accuracy affect third-party sellers' competition and the market outcomes. Sellers strategically adjust prices to compete for the marketplace's recommendations. As the marketplace more accurately predicts consumers' preferences, the equilibrium price first decreases and then increases, and both the marketplace's and the sellers' profits may decrease despite the improved recommendation accuracy. Moreover, recommending the most profitable product for each recommendation may reduce profits of the marketplace and the sellers, and the marketplace can benefit from excluding pricing information in its recommendation decisions to prevent sellers' recommendation competition. Counterintuitively, regulations that bar recommendations from considering profit margin information can lead to higher prices and thus harm consumers. These results are driven by competing sellers' three distinctive incentives: competing for recommendations, exploiting targeted consumers, and undercutting rivals' prices. We also find that our key insights remain qualitatively unchanged if the marketplace recommends products based on consumer surplus, and the equilibrium price will be lower in comparison. Finally, various extensions demonstrate the robustness of these results.","Zhou, B; Zou, TX",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2022.1388,online marketplace; personalization; recommendation system; platform bias; retail platform; platform regulation; search engine optimization,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of personalized product recommendations on market outcomes, pricing strategies, and seller competition.

"Purpose - The paper seeks to discuss and analyse the nature of place umbrella brands and the role such brands play in promotion of a country, a region, or a city. The purpose is also to identify some salient success criteria of provenance associations as core values of place umbrella brands. Design/methodology/approach - The study delineates a conceptual framework, which illustrates important components in place umbrella branding. It also highlights a set of criteria to aid prioritisations among prospective provenance associations that have a potential to be used as brand values of place umbrella brands. Practical implications - The paper identifies some characteristics of provenance associations, which make them more transferable across a bundle of umbrella brand partners. The generation of better marketing theory in the field of place branding will make it easier for practitioners to reach the right decisions in choice of provenance associations. Findings - It is claimed that transcendence is related to the transferability of provenance associations across a bundle of brands. Because transferability strongly depends on perceptions of similarity, the starting point is to identify matches between the partner brands based on their shared provenance. Originality/value - The article ends with a recommendation that researchers in place branding should carefully analyze provenance associations according to the suggested criteria.","Iversen, NM; Hem, LE",Strategic,10.1108/03090560810862534,brands; brand management; brand image,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper discusses the overarching concepts related to place umbrella brands, focusing on long-term implications for branding a country, region, or city.

"We discuss a case study of an industrial production-marketing coordination problem involving component commonality. For the product line considered, the strategic goal of the company is to move from the current low volume market to a high volume market. The marketing department believes that this can be achieved by substantially lowering the end products' prices. However, this requires a product redesign to lower production costs in order to maintain profit margins. The redesign decision involves grouping end products into families. All products within one family use the same version of some components. This paper fits in the stream of recent literature on component commonality where the focus has shifted from inventory cost savings to production and development cost savings. Further, we consider both costs and revenues, leading to a profit maximization approach. The price elasticity of demand determines the relationship between the price level and number of units sold. Consequently, we integrate information from different functional areas such as production, marketing and accounting. We formulate the problem as a net-present-value investment decision. We propose a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model to find the optimal commonality decision. The recommendation based on our analysis has been implemented in the company. In addition, the application allows us to experimentally validate some claims made in the literature and obtain managerial insights into the trade-offs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"In recent decades, there is an increase in new environmental problems in the world, which gradually grow from the local to the global level, and their short-term consequences are gradually becoming long-term complex threats to the environment and thus the quality of life of current and especially future generations. The main goal of the article was to review the behavior and attitudes of environmentally responsible consumers on the Slovak market and analyze the individual components of consumption and waste policy within the regions in the Slovak Republic in the context of environmental protection. Based on the cluster analysis and decision trees, we concluded that Slovak consumers rarely include eco-products in their consumption, mainly due to the high price or poor availability of these products. Through a cluster analysis, we analyzed the consumption and specificities of individual Slovak regions, while the recommendation is to create special different strategies focused on the regions of the Slovak Republic, based on waste reduction or the creation of waste recovery plants, which can create a favorable development in the circular economy of the Slovak Republic, and thus reduce the negative aspects of consumption affecting the environment and quality of life in the Slovak Republic.","Drábik, P; Rehák, R; Vernerová, D; Kukura, M",Strategic,10.31577/ekoncas.2020.10.06,environment; eco-product; marketing; sustainability; sustainable consumption,5.0,,10,5,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,"The abstract focuses on long-term environmental issues and the behavior of consumers in Slovakia, aiming for a larger goal of improving environmental quality and sustainability.

"Activists strive to create industry-level change and institutionalize socially and environmentally responsible practices by engaging with high profile and legitimate firms. In doing so, they reach a broad audience of firms who carefully observe and evaluate the activists-target interaction. Drawing on legitimacy theory and using a vignette-based roleplaying experiment, this paper investigates how different characteristics of both the activists' campaign and the targeted firms' response jointly affect the likelihood that observing firms' decision makers will support the sustainability practice recommended by the activists. Specifically, we assess how observers' evaluations of both the legitimacy of the target firms' decision and the legitimacy of activists' recommendation affect their support for the activists' recommendations. Subsequently, we evaluate the ways in which different characteristics of the activists-target interaction (including activists' engagement style, their evidence quality, and target firm adoption decision) drive these two legitimacy evaluations. Our results highlight the importance of both target decision legitimacy and activists' recommendation legitimacy on the relationship between target's practice adoption and observer support for the practice.","Taylor, KM; Hajmohammad, S; Vachon, S",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.007,Legitimacy theory; Sustainable supply chain; Activist engagement; Vignette-based experiment,10.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term impact of activists' engagement with firms on sustainability practices, examining how legitimacy impacts decision-making at a broader organizational level, indicating a focus on organizational goals and institutional change.",wos-recommendation,70,15,Activist engagement and industry-level change: Adoption of new practices by observing firms,2021
"Extending the study of consumer-brand relationships in the post-purchase stages of consumer decision making and in situations involving unfavorable comparisons with foregone brands, this research investigates the role of consumer-brand identification on consumer responses to purchase regret. Drawing on regret theory and consumer-brand relationship literature, the authors argue that consumer-brand identification immunizes the brand from the negative consequences of purchase regret through the amplification of consumers' cognitive regret regulation and the attenuation of consumers' behavioral regret coping. An empirical study using scenario manipulation of regret for participants' favorite brands provides support to the protective role of consumer brand identification. The results indicate that consumer-brand identification attenuates the negative effects of regret on satisfaction and behavioral intentions and strengthens the positive impact of satisfaction on brand repurchase/recommendation intent. The findings enrich regret and consumer-brand relationship theories and provide managerial insights for effective branding strategy development under conditions of intense competitive pressure.","Davvetas, V; Diamantopoulos, A",Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.04.008,Consumer-brand identification; Regret; Satisfaction; Consumer-brand relationships,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The research investigates consumer-brand relationships and their long-term implications on consumer behavior, particularly in the context of purchase regret, which aligns with strategic planning and branding strategies.",wos-recommendation,50,30,Regretting your brand-self?

"This article examines the effect of political identity on customers' satisfaction with the products and services they consume. Recent work suggests that conservatives are less likely to complain than liberals. Building on that work, the present research examines how political identity shapes customer satisfaction, which has broad implications for customers and firms. Nine studies combine different methodologies, primary and secondary data, real and hypothetical behavior, different product categories, and diverse participant populations to show that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more satisfied with the products and services they consume. This happens because conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to believe in free will (i.e., that people have agency over their decisions) and, therefore, to trust their own decisions. The authors document the broad and tangible downstream consequences of this effect for customers' repurchase and recommendation intentions and firms' sales. The association of political identity and customer satisfaction is attenuated when belief in free will is externally weakened, choice is limited, or the consumption experience is overwhelmingly positive.","Fernandes, D; Ordabayeva, N; Han, K; Jung, J; Mittal, V",Strategic,10.1177/00222429211057508,political identity; belief in free will; customer satisfaction; repurchase intention; sales; political ideology,5.0,,5,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The article explores how political identity affects customer satisfaction and has broad implications for firms, indicating a focus on long-term organizational goals related to customer perception and identity.",wos-recommendation,70,20,How Political Identity Shapes Customer Satisfaction,2022
"Purpose: This study analyzes the effect of brand deletion (BD), by a company strategizing to reduce its brand portfolio, on consumers' purchase intention (PI) and word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendations. Method: Three single-factor, 2 x 1 between-subject experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of post-acquisition brand strategy (maintenance vs. deletion) on PI and WOM recommendations. The mediating effect of negative affect (NA) and the moderating effect of self-brand connection (SBC) were also analyzed. Originality / Relevance: This experimental study is the first to analyze how BD impacts consumers' affective (NA) and conative (PI and WOM recommendation) responses to the brand they perceive as accountable for this decision, in a merger and acquisition (M&A) context. Results: In a M&A scenario, consumers with high levels of SBC will present higher NA following BD. Consequently, they will reduce their PI and WOM recommendation of the products of the acquirer company undertaking BD. Theoretical / methodological contributions: Results highlight the importance of considering a brand's SBC before opting for BD because it not only affects that particular brand but may also reduce PI and WOM recommendations of the company implementing BD.","Baptista, PD; Viacava, JJC; Del Secchi, J",Strategic,10.5585/remark.v21i2.18452,Brand deletion; Self-brand connection; Purchase intention; Word of mouth; Negative affect,5.0,,10,0,UNIV NOVE JULHO,"The study analyzes the long-term implications of brand deletion on consumer behavior and purchase intentions, making strategic decisions related to brand management in a merger and acquisition context.",wos-recommendation,60,25,CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND DELETION: ANALYSIS OF SELF-BRAND CONNECTION,2022

"PurposeThis study aims to explore the determinants influencing consumer purchase intentions towards electric vehicles (EVs) within the Asian market. It specifically examines how perceived value and perceived risk interact with the moderating effects of environmental, policy, and social factors to shape consumer behaviors towards EV adoption. The purpose is to delineate the intricate mechanisms driving consumer intentions in the context of sustainable mobility solutions.Design/methodology/approachAdopting a quantitative research design, this investigation collected data via a survey targeting consumers across various Asian countries. The study utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the responses, enabling a robust examination of the relationships between perceived value, perceived risk, and the potential moderating roles of external factors on consumer purchase intentions towards EVs.FindingsThe analysis revealed that both perceived value and perceived risk significantly influence consumers' intentions to purchase EVs. It was also found that environmental factors effectively moderate the relationship between perceived risk and purchase intentions, while social factors moderate the relationship between perceived risk and purchase intentions, highlighting the complex influence of external elements on consumer decisions. Contrarily, policy factors did not exhibit a significant moderating impact on the relationships examined.Originality/valueThis research enriches the domain of sustainable technology adoption by providing nuanced insights into the factors driving consumer intentions towards EVs in the Asian context.

"Generally, profit predictions are made conditional upon a particular functional form. The typical caveat offered is that this is not the true demand model, but is instead some reasonable approximation. We show how the notion of an approximation can be explicitly represented using a random coefficient model. Our model nests the usual situation of complete model certainty as a special case. We go on to show how ignoring the uncertainty in functional form induced by approximation will lead to erroneous pricing decisions that may frequently lead to overpricing. For example, an inelastic, double-log demand model implies infinite optimal prices. This is clearly a nonsensical, analyst recommendation. We propose a more general form of the double-log model that allows for high confidence in the observed price range, but incorporates increased uncertainty about the adequacy of the double-log approximation as prices move beyond the observed range. The optimal pricing solutions for this new model are lower than those for the usual case with complete certainty. In fact, we find well-defined optimal pricing solutions even for inelastic double-log demand models. This is a finding of great practical importance, given that aggregate demand models tend to be inelastic for grocery categories, and that log demand models are frequently used (Hoch et al. 1995). We argue that the lack of recognizing uncertainty in the modeling process may partially account for why there is a seeming disparity between observed retail prices and the optimal prices implied by maximizing total category profits using estimated demand models (Little and Shapiro 1980). The problems of making optimal pricing decisions using double-log demand models calibrated with store-level scanner data have been recognized. Previous solutions are to constrain the results to achieve reasonable solutions (Reibstein and Gatignon 1984, Montgomery 1997) or to avoid these models altogether in favor of household choice models aggregated to the store-level (Vilcassim and Chintagunta 1995). Our assessment of the problem is that it is not necessarily an issue of model specification, but one of inference. In other words, double-log models fit well, but optimization leads to out-of-range predictions. Our suggestion is that inferences from an estimated demand model need to be approached with some caution. Specifically, uncertainty about predictions will always exist. If this uncertainty is incorporated into models such as the double-log form, then much better inferences can be made. It is our hope that this research will encourage others to think not only about model specification and estimation, but also inference.","Montgomery, AL; Bradlow, ET",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.18.4.569,approximations; demand estimation; pricing research; random; coefficient models; retailing,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the implications of model uncertainty in pricing decisions, focusing on long-term impacts and optimal pricing strategies, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-recommendation,60,25,Why analyst overconfidence about the functional form of demand models can lead to overpricing,1999
"This article examines innovative aspects of the development of tourism regions in Europe. The article aims to determine the intensity of the perception of innovation in the tourism region as a problem in its development. The ambition of the article is to assess the problems in the development of tourism regions in Europe in the field of innovation as a possible starting point for optimizing changes in local and regional tourism policy. The research analyses the positions of 95 regional tourism experts from 17 European countries. The database was based on a databank of 150 representatives of academia and 275 representatives of regional tourism organizations. To analyse the properties of categorical data and the relationships between them, we used Gamma, Kendall's Tau-b, Somers' D C vertical bar R, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi Coefficient, Contingency Coefficient, Cramer's V and the decision tree algorithm. The maturity of the innovation environment of tourism regions and their level of development influence the perception of innovations as a problem in their development. Southern European tourism regions perceive innovation as a problem in their development most intensively. Tourism regions with stronger innovation activity have a well-established quality management system and a comprehensive and systematically addressed supply of seasonal and off-season products. Tourism regions ranked in the emerging innovator group perceive the specified problems in the implementation of innovations more intensively. This reflects the lack of coordination of the product portfolio, both in terms of range and quality, in countries where the innovation environment is poorly developed. A key recommendation to mitigate the perception of innovations as a problem in the development of Europe's tourism regions is to focus attention on the implementation of regional policy instruments that stimulate the participation of tourism in the synergy effects of the existing innovation environment of the economy.","Kubickova, V; Labudova, V; Benesova, D; Mura, L",Strategic,10.21272/mmi.2023.3-17,innovation; innovation environment; perception of innovations; regional development; tourism region,5.0,,10,5,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY","The article focuses on long-term development issues in tourism regions, particularly regarding innovation and regional policy optimization, which align with strategic planning.",wos-recommendation,70,10,INNOVATIONS AND TOURISM REGIONS: ARE INNOVATIONS PERCEIVED AS A PROBLEM IN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPEAN TOURISM?,2023
"Consumers have traditionally made purchase decisions at the store shelf, giving institutional brick-and-mortar retailers great power to learn about and influence behaviors and preferences. With the rise of e-commerce, mobile shopping, and most recently smart technologies, new competitors threaten this long-standing supremacy. Adopting a value-creation perspective, we analyze how digitization started the erosion of institutional retailing as the primary interface to the customer. We develop a framework that identifies five new sources of value creation and propose how these advance and transform competition for this interface. Depending on the importance of the new sources of value creation (in different purchase situations), stationary retailing may prevail as an important interaction point in a multichannel decision journey. However, increasing diffusion of branded-product platforms including connected devices and online retail platforms is shifting this authority to new players. For the parties involved in this multilayered competition, acknowledging the changes and actively managing their position in the evolving eco-systems is crucial. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose The purpose of this research is to understand whether service robots can safeguard servicescapes from deviant consumer behaviour. Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour.","Dootson, P; Greer, DA; Letheren, K; Daunt, KL",Strategic,10.1108/JSM-11-2021-0400,Service innovation; Consumer deviance; Robotics; Servicescape,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The research explores the long-term implications of deploying service robots in service environments, particularly how their perceived humanness impacts consumer behavior and organizational investment decisions.",wos-robot,60,20,Reducing deviant consumer behaviour with service robot guardians,2023
"Understanding how consumers evaluate product and brand alternatives and perceive their quality should be of paramount importance to marketing, product development and quality management. Several brand choice behavior models have been researched in literature, from utility maximization models in traditional economics, to attributebased sequential elimination or selection models and heuristics in behavioral economics, to two-stage models combining some of these principles. Previous attempts to provide an overview of these models have been incomplete. We provide an analysis and exhaustive, up to date, consolidation of brand choice behavior models, and conclude selected shortcomings and opportunities for improvement in current research literature. This consolidation is a one-stop shop for consumer behavior researchers, and marketing, product development and quality management professionals, who want to understand the different models, processes or steps adopted by consumers in evaluating brand and product alternatives and making their choice.","Teleaba, F; Popescu, S; Ilesan, H",Strategic,,brand choice behavior; customer behavior; consumer choice,5.0,,15,0,SOC ROMANA PENTRU ASIGURAREA CALITATII,"The abstract discusses brand choice behavior models and their implications for long-term strategic planning in marketing, product development, and quality management.",wos-robot,50,30,Customer Perceptions among Product and Brand Alternatives: Analysis and Consolidation of Models of Brand Choice Behavior,2021
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current role of qualitative research in the analysis of the relations between brands and consumers in new market spaces, with particular reference to how it can be enhanced with quantitative techniques to study interactions in online communities. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews key scientific contributions in the area of qualitative marketing research. Drawing from this theoretical background, the authors then propose the integration of digital ethnography (a qualitative approach) with quantitative text mining as an innovative approach to gain insights into perceptions of brand associations among online consumers. Findings - The paper contributes to a greater awareness of both limitations and new perspectives in relation to qualitative market research, while suggesting innovative paths for future research. Practical implications - The new methodological approach described can be used to better understand brand knowledge based on consumer brand associations. These insights can then be applied towards developing and implementing effective branding strategies. Originality/value - The authors propose an interdisciplinary methodology to study consumer behaviour in online communities which incorporates digital ethnography and computer-assisted textual analysis. Particularly the latter technique (borrowed from the field of linguistics) has not yet been exploited extensively in marketing research, but is capable of offering new types of knowledge with important implications for strategic brand management.","Ranfagni, S; Guercini, S; Camiciottoli, BC",Strategic,10.1108/MD-04-2012-0284,Text mining; Online communities; Brand associations; Digital ethnography; Qualitative-quantitative approach,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,The paper discusses the integration of qualitative and quantitative research methods to understand consumer-brand relationships and suggests innovative paths for future research.

"This study uses a Logit model to examine the probability of the image of the tourism destination Madeira, a Portuguese autonomous insular region, being strengthened after the tourists's visit to the destination. The results of the empirical study are based on a survey carried out to tourists during their visit to the island of Madeira, between March and July 2008. The model confirms that the probability of enhancing Madeira's tourism destination image after the visit is explained by several independent variables, gathered from the literature review. The findings of the study intend to call local authorities's attention to the importance of repeated tourists due to the impact that their enhanced image of Madeira may have on the economic sustainability of the destination and on the potential savings in promotion investment. This happens because the client's loyalty brings a high return of the destination's marketing investment. The conclusions can also help the decision makers of the tourism sector of the island of Madeira to better plan their destination marketing activities.",Machado L.P.; Santos C.M.; Sarmento M.,Strategic,,Destination image; Loyalty; Satisfaction; Service quality; Sustainability,5.0,,5,0,Varna University of Management,"The study focuses on the long-term implications of enhancing the tourism destination image of Madeira, which relates to strategic planning and decision-making for local authorities and tourism sector stakeholders.",scopus-autonomous,70,20,Madeira Island - Destination image and tourists loyalty,2009
"Product seeding, defined as the act by which firms send products to selected customers and encourage them to spread word of mouth, is a critical decision support strategy for the success of new products. Using multiple agent-based simulation techniques, we investigated the relative importance of three widely adopted seeding strategies (seeding influentials, early adopters, and random targets) in a competitive market in which products are vertically differentiated in terms of quality and brand strength. We found robust evidence that the finding of an optimal seeding strategy depends on consumers' propensity to spread negative WOM. When negative WOM propensity is low, seeding influentials outperform seeding early adopters or random targets. When negative WOM propensity is high, decision-making about an optimal seeding strategy relies on the relative quality and brand strength of the product and the focal firm's objective. In particular, if a product's relative quality is low, seeding early adopters is the optimal seeding strategy in terms of both market share (MS) and net present value (NPV); if the product's relative quality is equal, seeding early adopters is most effective for increasing MS, while seeding influentials is the best for increasing NPV; and if the product's relative quality is high, seeding influentials is the optimal strategy, except that for products with strong brand strength and firm aims at maximizing the MS growth. We conclude the paper by discussing its theoretical contributions and managerial relevance for decision support. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Cui F.; Wang L.; Luo X.R.; Cui X.,Strategic,10.1016/j.dss.2024.114263,Agent-based modeling; Market competition; New product marketing; Product seeding; Word-of-mouth,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses decision support strategies for product seeding, focusing on long-term implications and outcomes in competitive markets.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt a three-stage cloud-based management system for optimizing greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and marketing decisions with supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain with multiple suppliers, one single manufacturer and multiple retailers. Design/methodology/approach: The manufacturer purchases optional components of a certain functionality from his alternative suppliers and customizes a set of platform products for retailers in different independent market segments. To tackle the studied problem, a hierarchical analytical target cascading (ATC) model is proposed, Jaya algorithm is applied and supplier selection and product family design are implemented in its encoding procedure. Findings: A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the ATC model in solving the optimization problem and the corresponding algorithm. It has shown that the ATC model can not only obtain close optimization results as a central optimization method but also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. Originality/value: This paper first develops a three-stage cloud-based management system to optimize GHG emission, marketing decisions, supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain. Then, the ATC model is proposed to obtain the close optimization results as central optimization method and also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Huang Y.; Gao K.; Wang K.; Lv H.; Gao F.,Strategic,10.1108/IMDS-06-2021-0402,Analytical target cascading; Cloud technology; Greenhouse gas; Jaya; Product family design; Supplier selection,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract describes a framework for optimizing greenhouse gas emissions and marketing decisions within a multi-level supply chain, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and planning.

"Purpose: Interorganizational (IO) cooperation has been examined primarily as a role-based concept. This research seeks to extend this concept by examining a distinct mode of IO cooperation: favor-based cooperation. This concept refers to voluntary exchanges of preferential treatments between boundary personnel across organizations that are perceived as going beyond the requirements of their role relationships. Methodology/Approach: A qualitative case research design is used to build a grounded theoretical framework on favor-based cooperation. The empirical basis of the proposed framework includes around 300 favor incidents gathered through multiple sources to get a broad and balanced view of the phenomenon. Theoretically, the author employs role theory to conceptualize favor-based cooperation as qua persona, extra-role behavior; additionally, he draws on transaction cost economics (TCE) to examine the value of favor-based cooperation as a means of adaptation relative to TCE relational contracting. Findings: As an extra-role behavior, the added value of favor-based cooperation lies in its capability to provide extra flexibility in the system via informal consent to adaptation requests and preferred access to exchange partner’s time availability. But this mode of cooperation involves a high risk of opportunism when a lot is at stake. Thus, favor-based cooperation best suits IO exchanges that require highly frequent but lowly consequential coordinated adaptation and can enhance IO value creation beyond role-based cooperation (relational contracting) in these situations. Since favor-based cooperation involves transgressing the market forces, it ill-suits IO exchanges that require autonomous adaptations. As a qua persona behavior, favor-based cooperation first and foremost serves the interests of the individuals involved. Thus, whereas interorganizational interest alignment provides sufficient incentive for beneficial role-based cooperation to occur, beneficial favor-based cooperation also requires organizational-individual interest alignment. Research Implications: The inclusion of the favor-based cooperation concept in the study of IO cooperation helps address the overlooked individual aspect of IO cooperation. In the role-based approach that is typical in research on IO cooperation, boundary personnel are viewed as organizational agents who act to maximize their respective organizational interests. In viewing IO cooperation as qua persona behavior (as in the case of favor-based cooperation), the current research explicitly accounts for boundary personnel’s individual interests. While individual interests do account for certain harmful behaviors (e.g., buying business or covering poor performance), they also account for beneficial behaviors that have not been adequately accounted for in role-based theories of IO cooperation. For example, it is individual interests (e.g., the desire to help a friend) that motivate some boundary persons to exert extra efforts to accommodate exchange partner’s unplanned requests for adaptation. Accordingly, knowledge of how the individual interests of the decision-makers affect IO cooperative activities and the outcomes of these activities (via, e.g., favor behaviors) can enhance the explanatory power of theories of cooperation. For example, favor-based cooperation is beneficial particularly in certain exchange situations where role-based cooperation (TCE relational contracting) will likely fail, such as exchange situations that require highly frequent (but lowly consequential) coordinated adaptations. Knowledge of how boundary personnel’s individual interests affect IO cooperation and its outcomes via favor behaviors is also relevant for the understanding of the incentive required for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. According to the role-based view, boundary personnel’s personal motivation is irrelevant. Accordingly, IO interest alignment established via, e.g., mutual credible commitment provides sufficient incentive for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. But to the extent that boundary personnel’s individual interests are relevant, IO interest alignment is necessary but insufficient; organizational-individual interest alignment within each participating organization is also needed for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. Practical Implications: Findings have implications for the role of favor-based cooperation in organizations and effective management of this mode of cooperation. While many organizations appear to value favor-based cooperation, its role is not without controversy, as some scholars view it as harmful behavior that should be discouraged. The findings of this research support a balanced view. Favor-based cooperation is an ultra-flexible means of coordinated adaptation that can help organizations respond effectively to accelerating change in their business environment. However, favor-based cooperation may not be the optimal cooperative mechanism when a lot is at stake; thus, in most exchange situations it should play only a supplemental role. Moreover, this mode of cooperation involves a high probability of misuse. Findings yield unobtrusive measures for effective management of favor exchanges. To benefit from these informal and discretionary cooperative activities, organizations need to develop organizational-individual interest alignment by economic and social incentives. They need to provide boundary personnel with decision criteria to help them select and structure beneficial favor exchange opportunities, and sufficient discretion and resources to realize these opportunities. Originality/Value/Contribution: This research extends the role-based IO cooperation concept to include favor-based cooperation–a qua persona and extra-role behavior. To the author’s knowledge, this research is the first in-depth investigation of this mode of IO cooperation. The findings highlight the distinct scope of favor-based cooperation, specify its added value and downsides as a means of adaptation, and explain the incentive required for beneficial favor-based cooperation to occur. Given that TCE currently has a prominent role in the IO marketing literature, by specifying the value of favor-based cooperation relative to TCE modes of cooperation the current research helps position favor-based cooperation within mainstream IO marketing research. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Nguyen A.,Strategic,10.1080/1051712X.2020.1787025,adaptation; business marketing; extra-role behavior; favor exchange; industrial marketing; Interorganizational cooperation; relational contracting; social exchange; transaction cost economics; value creation,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the concept of favor-based cooperation in interorganizational contexts, focusing on how individual interests align with organizational goals to enhance cooperation.

"Purpose: Big data analytics (BDA) is becoming a strategic tool to harness data to achieve business efficiencies. While business-to-customer organizations have adopted BDA, its adoption in business-to-business (B2B) has been slow, raising concerns about the lack of understanding of the need to adopt BDA. Little knowledge exists on the subject and the purpose of this study is to examine BDA adoption needs among B2B organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) following the six-step SLR guidelines of Templier and Paré (2015) involved 1,051 articles, which were content analyzed. Findings: The authors offer two-pronged findings. First, on the basis of the SLR, the authors develop a new four-category classification scheme of needs to adopt BDA and present a consolidated review of the current knowledge base along with these categories (i.e. innovation, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and digital transformation). Second, underpinned by the theory of organizational motivation and literature evidence, the authors develop propositions and a corresponding model of BDA adoption needs. The authors show that BDA adoption among B2B organizations is driven by the need to augment customer lifetime value, champion the change, improve managerial decision cycle-time, tap into social media benefits and align with market transformation. Research limitations/implications: The results facilitate theory development as the study creates a new classification scheme of needs and a model of needs to adopt BDA in large B2B organizations. Practical implications: The findings will serve as a guideline framework for managers to examine their BDA adoption needs and strategize its adoption. Originality/value: The study develops a new four-category classification scheme for understanding B2B organizations’ needs to adopt big data analytics.

"Machine learning is bringing us self-driving cars, medical diagnoses, and language translation, but how can machine learning help marketers improve marketing decisions? Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to “big data,” and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight—the soul—the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for “what-if” and “but-for” applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul. The brightest future is based on the synergy of what the machine can do well and what humans do well.

"Due to the industrial revolution and, thereby with, the emergence of Industry 4.0, there has been an impact on the marketing of business firms, enabling them to digitally transform and adopt Marketing 4.0 practices supported by smart technologies. One of these is Big Data Analytics (BDA), which enables a firm to improve its marketing practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate how integrating big data technology improves the marketing strategies of Indian FMCG companies operating in a dynamic and highly competitive market distinguished by its size and diversity, constantly changing consumer behaviour, and Marketing 4.0 trends. This study adopts a systematic approach to coding an interview with seasoned Indian FMCG professionals to explain the capabilities of Big Data in molding marketing practices. A framework is constructed based on the same. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed to visualize its applicability in business.

"Purpose: Digital technologies, digitalised consumers and the torrent of customer data have been transforming marketing practice. In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts. Findings: Drawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a ‘hacking marketing’ approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries. Practical implications: This study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study’s results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Hafezieh N.; Pollock N.; Ryan A.,Strategic,10.1108/JEIM-12-2021-0530,Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Digitalised consumers; Expertise; Hacking; Occupations; Practice,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of digital transformation in marketing, focusing on how organizations can develop new marketing expertise and practices.

"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms&#x2019; financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria&#x0027;s. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig.&#x00A0;1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management&#x0027;s post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study&#x0027;s findings were used to develop Fig.&#x00A0;2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management&#x0027;s support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study&#x0027;s hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE&#x0027;s critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management&#x0027;s decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations&#x2019; FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context.

"This study examines the experience of marketing departments to become fully data-driven decision-making organizations. We evaluate an organic approach of departmental sensemaking and an administered approach by which top management increase the influence of analytics skilled employees. Data collection commenced with 15 depth interviews of marketing and analytics professionals in the US and Europe involved in the implementation of big data analytics (BDA) and was followed by a survey data of 298 marketing and analytics middle management professionals at United States based firms. The survey data supports the logic that BDA sensemaking is initiated by top management and is comprised of four primary activities: external knowledge acquisition, improving digitized data quality, big data analytics experimentation and big data analytics information dissemination. Top management drives progress toward data-driven decision-making by facilitating sensemaking and by increasing the influence of BDA skilled employees. This study suggests that while a shift toward enterprise analytics increases the quality of resource available to the marketing department, this approach could stymie the quality of marketing insights gained from BDA.

"Academics and businesses alike tend to fail at understanding how the IoT revolution is monetized. We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial-and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection. © 2021 by the authors.

"Purpose: In the current business environment, more uncertain than ever before, understanding consumer behavior is an integral part of an organization's strategic planning and execution process. It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in data driven-marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the “right” customers, to “keep” and “grow” them and to sustain “growth” and “profitability”. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses, 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included retail, BFSI, healthcare and government, automobile, telecommunication, transport and logistics and IT. Other industries represented were aviation, marketing research and consulting, hospitality, advertising and media and human resource. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for DDM. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders and Leaders based on their “current level of investments” and “willingness to enhance investments” soon. Research limitations/implications: With storming digital age and the development of analytics, the process of decision-making has gained significant importance. Judgment and intuition too are critical to the process. Choosing an appropriate action cannot be done strictly on a rational basis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of DDM. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; however, attitudes and social factors are equally important. Originality/value: There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Grandhi B.; Patwa N.; Saleem K.,Strategic,10.1108/EMJB-09-2018-0054,Customer centric; Data-driven marketing; Digital data; Digital marketing and marketing investment; Marketing analytics; Marketing dashboard; Marketing metrics; ROMI (return on marketing investment) and diffusion of innovation; Value proposition,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the importance of data-driven marketing (DDM) in enhancing shareholder value and customer centricity, which are strategic goals for organizations.

"Context: businesses have always used data to make decisions, but the amount, variety, and speed of data have increased dramatically in recent years. This fact led to the emergence of big data, which in turn intensified innovation, led to new services and products such as real-time traffic information and personalized marketing and delivery services. While big data has led to efficiency gains, it has also sparked a new debate in antitrust: to what extent, if any, could data become a competitive concern? Objective: this article is a case study on the Brazilian retail market based on recent literature on barriers to entry fostered by data-based activities and the importance of data as an asset capable of creating market power and giving rise to anti-competitive practices. Method: a bibliographical review was carried out regarding the importance of data as a possible asset that creates barriers to entry, as well as the interpretation of the Brazilian antitrust authority – Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade), in recent mergers, in addition to an exploratory analysis of data on access and revenue of the main retail players in different market segments and business types. Conclusions: the article concludes that, taking into account the case study, it is not evident that big data leads to highly competitive advantages in the retail sector in Brazil and that competitive concerns do not extend to all data-intensive markets, as data can be segmented and provide different competitive advantages that do not imply relevant barriers to the Brazilian retail sector. © 2024, Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE).

"Purpose: This research aimed to analyze and prioritize the factors affecting sustainable marketing (SM) and sustainable operation (SO) of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs through big data adoption (BDA). Design/methodology/approach: The technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical base and data were gathered from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN). Findings: The findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS. Practical implications: The findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development. Originality/value: The manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations. However, the associations between BDA and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs have been less explored. To address this issue, this study developed a theoretical model and examined the influence of BDA on SM and SO of manufacturing SMEs. Meanwhile, the hybrid methodological approach can help to uncover both linear and non-linear relationships better. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Baig M.I.; Yadegaridehkordi E.; Nizam Bin Md Nasir M.H.,Strategic,10.1108/MD-06-2022-0778,Big data adoption; SMEs; Sustainable marketing; Sustainable operations,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The research focuses on analyzing and prioritizing factors affecting sustainable marketing and operations in SMEs through big data adoption, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic decision-making.",scopus-big data,60,20,Influence of big data adoption on sustainable marketing and operation of SMEs: a hybrid approach of SEM-ANN,2023
"Purpose: Big data capabilities have the potential to completely transform conventional methods of doing business. Nevertheless, the role of big data capabilities in fostering green marketing capabilities and improving green competitive advantage is still not fully understood. To add new knowledge, this paper aims to propose a moderated mediation model to strengthen green competitive advantage in a big data environment. The model introduces both the mediating role of green marketing capabilities and the moderating role of big data capabilities. We developed and empirically tested a moderated mediation model. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we have adopted a survey-based methodology. The study collected data from 337 managers and empirically analyzed it to test the theoretical model of moderated mediation. We employed structural equation modeling for empirical analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that organizational learning improves green marketing capabilities, whereas the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage is insignificant. The mediating role of green marketing capabilities in the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage was statistically significant, indicating that green marketing capabilities serve as a bridge between organizational learning and green competitive advantage. Big data capabilities moderate the relationship between organizational learning and green marketing capabilities. The moderated mediation was also significant, highlighting that big data capabilities further strengthen the indirect effects of organizational learning on green competitive advantage via green marketing capabilities. Originality/value: This paper delivers theoretical and practical understandings of the importance of organizational learning and big data capabilities. Similarly, it extends current knowledge and provides key insights for managerial decision-making. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Zameer H.; Wang Y.; Yasmeen H.,Strategic,10.1108/BPMJ-09-2023-0691,Big data; Green competitive advantage; Green marketing capabilities; Organizational learning,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the importance of big data capabilities and organizational learning in enhancing green marketing capabilities and competitive advantage, which aligns with long-term strategic goals and planning of the organization.",scopus-big data,60,20,Strengthening green competitive advantage through organizational learning and green marketing capabilities in a big data environment: a moderated-mediation model,2024
"Purpose: As big data (BD) has increasingly become an important tool for managers and researchers to transform sport management practices, the purpose of this research is to highlight diverse data sources and modern analytical techniques that will leverage BD as a means to advance scholarship in sport management.

"With the increasing use and availability of computing power and raised consumer power comes the need in competitive markets to produce and offer products and services that provide as precisely as possible the exact features of offerings that match customer requirements, with as little waste as possible. Further, customers have different thresholds of willingness to pay for sets of features. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and model the merging of supply chain strategies with the marketing decisions, which is key to the overall optimization of aspects of a firm’s strategy, including design of its products and their features, pricing, and positioning. The method used was to create the comprehensive modeling approach that represents these challenges not based on products, but based on individual features of those products, atomistically. The theoretical contribution made is the integration of supply chain optimization approaches, that are essentially based on the resource based view of the firm and focus on cost, with the marketing orientation approach to product design, pricing and marketing strategies. Further, this theoretical contribution recognises in its models that mass customization provides for individualization of features offered to each customer, at prices that reflect their assessed willingness to pay. There are many practical implications: many firms are moving towards full customization of feature sets, and increasingly pricing in a customized manner, and this trend will continue in practice as big data applications in markets go further and become more cost efficient. The integration of the marketing view and the resource-based operations view allows for a fully integrated view of competitive strategy and the design of products and services, so that firms can profit optimize their offerings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Wacker J.G.; Samson D.,Strategic,10.1007/s12063-021-00218-8,Business strategy; Marketing management; Micro-strategy; Modeling business strategies; Operations management; Operations marketing integration; Optimisation; Product features; Recource based view; Strategic integration; Supply chain management,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract addresses the integration of supply chain strategies with marketing decisions, focusing on long-term optimization of product design, pricing, and positioning, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-big data,70,15,Beyond supply chain management: jointly optimising operations/ supply and the marketing mix,2021

"This paper studies a three-tier food delivery service supply chain (FDSSC) composed of one restaurant that is responsible for providing food and catering services, one food delivery platform that is responsible for providing big data marketing, and one rider that is responsible for providing food delivery services. Then, differential game theory is used to model and derive the objective functions and equilibrium strategies of the FDSSC members in four scenarios: decentralization, independent delivery, independent production, and centralization. The effects of cooperation patterns among the FDSSC members, consumer channel preferences, commission rates, and food delivery fees of the food delivery platform on the optimal decision-making and performance of the FDSSC members are discussed. Through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis of essential parameters, we summarize the following conclusions. First, whether it is independent production and independent delivery, any cooperation between the FDSSC members is always beneficial for the profit improvement of all FDSSC members. Therefore, the restaurant, food delivery platform, and rider should actively seek pairwise or tripartite cooperation to achieve common profit enhancement. In addition, when the online channel preference of consumers increases, the restaurant should continuously enhance the food quality and catering service level to ensure an amazing dining experience for consumers, which is conducive to the formation of a healthy dual-channel food sales model. Last, a higher commission rate can increase the profits of the food delivery platform and the whole FDSSC, but it damages the revenue of the restaurant, while a higher food delivery fee can bring more profits to the restaurant and rider. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Ma S.; He Y.; Gu R.; Yeh C.-H.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.103828,Big data marketing; Food delivery platform; Food delivery service; Food supply chain; Pricing,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term cooperation strategies among members of a food delivery service supply chain, focusing on optimizing decisions for profit enhancement and consumer satisfaction.

For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10–20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape. A traffic light dashboard for domestic and inbound air travel demand to Spain shows how destination managers might use Big Data relating to the early recovery of key source markets to develop targeted marketing strategies.

"Digital transformation is reshaping the decision making management of the rental service mode in the manufacturing industry, and improving digital detection technology and big data marketing have become effective ways to create value. Based on the three-level rental platform service supply chain network structure composed of manufacturers, rental platform operators and the demand market, a supply chain network equilibrium model considering the digital detection technology input and big data marketing is constructed by using variational inequality and the Nash equilibrium theory, and the optimal decision making conditions of the manufacturers and rental platform operators are derived. Combined with the Euler algorithm design procedure and numerical examples, the influences of the digital detection technology level, big data marketing cost coefficient and cost sharing ratio on the equilibrium state are analyzed. The results show that the input of digital detection technology leads to the increase in profits of each participant in the rental platform service supply chain network and promotes a more coordinated development of the supply chain. When the rental platforms implement big data marketing, the manufacturers share the cost, which can continuously improve the profits of both partners and make the cooperation more stable and efficient. © 2023 by the authors.",Peng Y.; Li H.,Strategic,10.3390/su15139955,big data marketing; digital detection technology investment; network equilibrium; rental platform service supply chain,5.0,,10,0,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of digital transformation on decision-making in the rental service mode of the manufacturing industry, focusing on value creation through technological advancements and cost-sharing strategies, which align with strategic planning.",scopus-big data,60,25,A Rental Platform Service Supply Chain Network Equilibrium Model Considering Digital Detection Technology Investment and Big Data Marketing,2023
"In the Industry 4.0 era, implementing advanced technologies to enhance platform operations is crucial. Motivated by the importance of platforms and the wide implementation of Industry 4.0-related advanced technologies, we conduct this study on platform operations. Specifically, the platforms discussed herein are classified into (pure) product selling platforms and service platforms. We identify the platform-related operational issues in four categories: 1) the use of information, 2) operating/manufacturing processes, 3) decision support, and 4) consumer behavior and marketing. Based on the examined real-world practices and reviewed prior studies, we propose the novel '3As' framework to indicate how platforms should 'adopt' advanced technologies to 'address' operational issues to 'achieve' outcomes. In addition, the '3As' framework uncovers possible platform innovations with three extended developments. Finally, we present a future agenda for further studies on the use of advanced technologies in platform operations.

"Big Data Analytics (BDA) solutions are increasingly applied in marketing, with the aim of transforming data available online to market information and competitive intelligence. When businesses encounter risky situations (calculated risks) complex models using BDA are often the go-to solution. However, there is a still a debate if BDA is the best solution in uncertain situations when unexpected phenomena arise. The present study begins to fill this gap using the Colombian context as evidence and a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fs-QCA). The focus shifts from a single cause leading to performance to an analysis of different associations of conditions. There are three major findings-first, in a risky environment, BDA is not a unique condition; a combination of data maturity levels, data skills and a data-driven mindset and culture are necessary to obtain good business performance. Second, even in the era of Big Data, large companies still use simple rules (heuristics) to make decisions which improve their performance. Finally, the environmental state (uncertain, certain, risky) is a moderating factor in the choice between BDA or Heuristics. The results indicate marketing managers should use a multi-model approach incorporating both BDA and heuristics. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Grimaldi D.; Sallan J.M.; Arboleda H.; Sehgal S.,Strategic,10.1080/12460125.2023.2232570,Big Data Analytics; Heuristic; Marketing; Risk; Uncertainty,5.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of Big Data Analytics in marketing, emphasizing the need for a multi-model approach and addressing complex decision-making in uncertain environments, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-big data,60,25,Rethinking the role of uncertainty and risk in Marketing,2023
"Contemporary industry practices must be appropriately reflected in designing modern-day teaching and learning programmes. Existing studies are limited to systematic methodologies for accumulating contemporary practice requirements and using that data to inform the design of educational programmes, even though various, local approaches for doing so often exist in higher education institutions. Going beyond this and adopting design-based research (DBR) principles, this paper introduces industry practitioner perspectives of contemporary- practice need for conceptualisation and design of a new business master’s degree programme. Outlining industry-demand as a driving force in stimulating a new business data-analytics programme at a medium-sized Australian metropolitan university, the study utilises open-ended interviews with five senior data analytics professionals to find a new matrix of industry expectations. The emerged elements are open-sourced tools based general technical knowledge; specific industry certifications or special skills; technology integration knowledge; cross-industry knowledge such as marketing; project management/agility and decision-making utilising appropriate supporting knowledge. Based on these findings, key learning objectives, an initial structure of the programme and specialisation subjects is proposed for further evaluation through convergent interviewing.

"This study proposes as a key cause of the high failure rates in the implementation of analytical projects for marketing decisions, the discrepancy in the information quality (DIQ) perceived between producers (information technology [IT]) and users (marketing) of knowledge. Given that the DIQ between agents is a determining factor in the success of the ability to data analytics, this study focuses on examining this concept and its causes, specifically the resources related to data analytics that influence DIQ. The results of the surveys carried out with the IT and marketing managers of 95 companies in Spain, analyzed with a comparative methodological approach (dyadic), reveal the sources of the discrepancy, namely, the quality of the data, the technological capabilities, the talent, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) support, and alignment of the data plan with the marketing plan.

"Purpose: Dynamic, volatile, and time-sensitive industries, such as tourism, travel and hospitality require agility and market intelligence to create value and achieve competitive advantage. The aim of the current study is to examine the influence of big data (BD) on the performance of service organizations and to probe for a deeper understanding of implementing BD, based on available technologies. Design/methodology/approach: An ethnographic study was conducted following an abductive approach. A primary qualitative research scheme was used with 35 information technology and database professionals participating in five online focus groups of seven participants each. Analytical themes were developed simultaneously with the literature being revisited throughout the study to ultimately create sets of common themes and dimensions. Findings: BD can help organizations build agility, especially within dynamic industries, to better predict customer behavioral patterns and make tailor-made propositions from the BD. An integrated BD-specific framework is proposed to address value according to the dimensions of need, value, time and utility. Research limitations/implications: Little research exists on the key drivers of BD use for dynamic, real-time and agile businesses. This research adds to the developing literature on BD applications to support organizational decision-making and business performance in the tourism industry.

To this end, the article provides commentary and structures to outline the impact of ExC and to elaborate the definition and reach of ExC. The logic of ExC culminates in a theory of cognitive states comprising of three potential decision states: endogenous cognition, symbiotic cognition and surrogate cognition.

"Purpose: Information on the impact of flooding is fundamental to mitigating flood risk in residential property. This paper aims to provide insight into the seller disclosure of flood risk and buyer behaviour in the absence of mandated seller disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a case study approach to critically evaluate the matrix of flood information available for buyers purchasing residential property in Brisbane, Queensland. This paper uses big data analytic techniques to extract and analyse internet data from online seller agents and buyer platforms to gain an understanding of buyer awareness and consideration of flood risk in the residential property market. Findings: Analysis of property marketing data demonstrates that seller agents voluntarily disclose flood impact only in periods where a flooding event is anticipated and is limited to asserting a property is free of flood risk. Analysis of buyer commentary demonstrates that buyers are either unaware of flood information or are discounting the risk of flood in favour of other property and locational attributes when selecting residential property. Practical implications: This research suggests that improved and accessible government-provided flood mapping tools are not enhancing buyers’ understanding and awareness of flood risk. Accordingly, it is recommended that mandatory disclosure be introduced in Queensland so that buyers are more able to manage risk and investment decisions before the purchase of residential property. Originality/value: This paper contributes to existing literature on raising community awareness and understanding of natural disaster risks and makes a further contribution in identifying mandatory disclosure as a mechanism to highlight the risk of flooding and inform residential property purchasers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Brown C.; Christensen S.; Blake A.; Indraswari K.; Wilson C.; Desouza K.,Strategic,10.1108/JPPEL-08-2022-0029,Community resilience; Consumer behaviour; Disaster management; Flood risk; Natural hazard,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The paper discusses the long-term implications of flood risk disclosure on buyer behavior and property market dynamics, suggesting mandatory disclosure as a strategic approach to manage risk in residential property purchases.",scopus-big data,60,20,"Is mandatory seller disclosure of flood risk necessary?

"This study considers the use of digitalization technologies in the management of marketing of a commercial company. As a result, the problem of bringing empirical knowledge about the importance of digitalization technologies in the company’s marketing management to a theoretical model has been solved. Digitalization technologies for implementation in marketing activities were selected and the decomposition of marketing management in a commercial company was performed. On this basis, a theoretical model for assessing the impact of digitalization technologies on the marketing management of a commercial company has been developed. The results of an empirical study based on the developed theoretical model proved the truth of the hypothesis about the positive impact of the spread of the use of digitalization technologies on the marketing management components of commercial companies. The choice of specific digitalization technologies is explained by the essence of marketing as a management activity. Structural decomposition of the marketing management process is explained by traditional management functions and clarifies the criteria for choosing technologies. The results of calculations according to the formed theoretical model are explained by the development of the platform economy and ecosystems, which involve the studied big data technologies, cloud computing and social media, as well as blockchain. The methodical approach to substantiating the role of digitalization technologies proposed in this study is characterized by the use of fundamental provisions on cybernetic systems, management theory, and modern marketing concepts.

"Big data analytics (BDA) is widely used in sales, marketing, distribution, and finance; however, its implementation in supply chain management, specifically in purchasing and supply management (PSM), has been slow and uneven. This study investigates the impact of BDA on strategic PSM decisions and how it interacts with a company's absorptive capacity. We conducted a survey of 222 purchasing and supply chain managers in international companies across various industries. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the exploration, assimilation, and transformation capabilities of purchasing departments are crucial in facilitating the use of BDA for strategic decision-making in PSM. Companies that excel in BDA in the PSM space are better equipped to capitalize on new and existing knowledge sources, which improves their performance. However, only businesses with the right resources can fully leverage BDA for high-level strategic decision-making; when BDA is applied to operational PSM activities, the desired effects may not be achieved. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Patrucco A.S.; Marzi G.; Trabucchi D.,Strategic,10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102814,Absorptive capacity; Big data analytics; Knowledge management; Purchasing management; Supply chain management,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the impact of big data analytics on strategic purchasing and supply management decisions, indicating a focus on long-term goals and the interaction with absorptive capacity within organizations.",scopus-big data,70,20,The role of absorptive capacity and big data analytics in strategic purchasing and supply chain management decisions,2023
"Product service bundle (PSB) is a marketing strategy that offers attractive product-service packages with competitive pricing to ensure sustained profitability. However, designing suitable pricing for PSB is a non-trivial task that involves complex decision-making. This paper explores the significance of pricing optimization in the telecommunication industry, focusing on product-service bundling (PSB). It delves into the challenges associated with pricing PSB and highlights the transformative impact of big data analytics on decision-making for PSB strategies. The study presents a data-driven pricing optimization model tailored for designing appropriate pricing structures for product-service bundles within the telecommunication services domain. This model integrates customer preference knowledge and involves intricate decision-making processes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the paper conducts a case study encompassing two design scenarios, wherein the results reveal that the model offers competitive pricing compared to existing telecommunication service providers, facilitating PSB design and decision-making. The findings from the case study indicate that the data-driven pricing optimization model can significantly aid PSB design and decision-making, leading to competitive pricing strategies that open avenues for new market exploration and ensure business sustainability. By considering both product and service features concurrently, the proposed model provides a pricing reference for optimal decision-making.

"Business resources and processes such as Big Data Marketing Analytics (BDMA) are becoming increasingly focused on meeting the needs and objectives of customers. Consequently, this research aims to use PLS-SEM to explain the interaction and relationships between the core user-centric performance measures of BDMA, such as user satisfaction, value for money and reinvestment intention. Also, the significance of the decision-making role was explored in this context. Finally, the impact of perceived financial performance was investigated to see its impact on the examined relationships. The impact of value for money on user satisfaction, the impact of the decision-making role on user satisfaction, and finally, the impact of the decision-making role on the reinvestment intentions were found to be significant for individuals who scored either low or high perceived financial performance. Furthermore, all the observed relationships in the dataset were positive, whereas only three were positive and significant for individuals who scored low on perceived financial performance. Overall, it is clear that perceived financial performance has a vital role in BDMA deployment, where understanding the influence of user authority in decision-making enables managers to design better organizational plans by integrating inputs from multiple organizational cross-layers. Also, the results indicate that a user’s decision-making role influences user-centric measures in BDMA deployment, which reveals how user perceptions and authority play a vital role in the context of BDMA in firms. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Haverila K.; Haverila M.; Rangarajan A.,Strategic,10.1080/10696679.2024.2305445,,5.0,,10,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of BDMA on user satisfaction and decision-making roles, indicating a focus on strategic planning within organizations to improve customer-centric outcomes.",scopus-big data,60,25,"The impact of the decision-making role on perceived satisfaction, value for money, and reinvest intentions at varying levels of perceived financial performance in the context of Big Data Marketing Analytics",2024
"While marketing analytics plays an important role in generating insights from big data to improve marketing decision-making and firm competitiveness, few academic studies have investigated the mechanisms through which it can be used to achieve sustained competitive advantage. To close this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capability view to posit that a firm can attain sustained competitive advantage from its sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities, which are manifested by the use of marketing analytics, marketing decision-making, and product development management. This study also examines the impact of the antecedents of marketing analytics use on marketing related processes. The analysis of a survey of 221 UK firm managers demonstrates: (a) the positive impact of marketing analytics use on both marketing decision-making and product development management; (b) the effect of the latter two on sustained competitive advantage; (c) the indirect effect of data availability on both marketing decision-making and production development management; and (d) the indirect effect of managerial support on marketing decision-making.

"Purpose - This chapter demonstrates the strategic use of social media by firms interacting with stakeholders, not just customers. Corporations have seen how consumers can share their experiences with products and services. Smart companies find ways to leverage these conversations to engage current and potential customers and other stakeholders. Design/methodological approach - Our approach is theoretical, based on an examination of how the communication channel of social media can be used as a strategic tool throughout the organization, going well beyond marketing. Findings - This chapter looks at four advantages of social media. Social media provides a mechanism for firms to not just find customers, but also allow customers to find firms. Social media can engage customers, industry influencers, and thought pundits in cost-effective ways that benefit both the firm and stakeholders. The largest contribution of social media is the information from big data on customer needs and wants as well as on the processes underlying consumer decisions. The greatest opportunity lies in how a firm converts data into actionable intelligence in real time. Practical applications - We discuss how the words, social and media, need to be de-coupled: The concept of social can be practically applied very effectively to areas of strategy and internal learning, and product development. Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by social media requires a social enterprise to be effective. Originality - This chapter presents an original theoretical framework of social media that can be used by a company to examine the social aspects and implications of every element in the value chain.

"In the age of “Internet+” many Internet service platforms (ISPs) in China have been widely introduced to the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To further study the role of the Internet service platform, this paper considers a CLSC composed of a manufacturer, a retailer and an Internet service platform who invests in research and development (R&D), advertising and Big Data marketing, and develops the goodwill dynamic model based on the differential game theory. The construction of a goodwill dynamic model has two purposes, namely, to increase sales and the return rate. The optimal decisions for 3 players under two different cooperative scenarios are obtained, namely, the retailer payment scenario (scenario D) and the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario (scenario S). The supply chain members gain more profit or achieve a higher level of goodwill for products under certain conditions, i.e., a high residual value from remanufacturing, a high sharing rate of residual value from the retailer's recycled products, and a low recycling cost. Interestingly, the wholesale price increases with the residual value of recycled products when goodwill effectiveness is low, while the price declines when goodwill effectiveness is high. After comparing two cooperative scenarios, the result shows that an Internet service platform will invest more in Big Data marketing under the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario, and cooperation between the manufacturer and the Internet service platform can help improve the goodwill of enterprises or products. Moreover, the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario is payoff-Pareto-improving in most cases through the coordination of a cost-sharing rate, and the effectiveness of Big Data marketing exerts a positive effect on goodwill and the development of the industry. In addition, the retailer has “free rider” tendencies in the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario. The results encourage more enterprises to enhance the value of goodwill through cooperation with Internet service platforms because Internet service platforms conveniently utilize Big Data marketing to increase the sales of products and the collecting rate of used products, which in turn helps environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Xiang Z.; Xu M.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.310,Big data marketing; Closed-loop supply chain; Differential game; Internet service platform,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of integrating Internet service platforms into closed-loop supply chains, focusing on cooperation, goodwill enhancement, and R&D investment, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals.",scopus-big data,60,25,Dynamic cooperation strategies of the closed-loop supply chain involving the internet service platform,2019

"There is much hype associated with the term ‘Big Data’ (BD), and much opportunity in the data that are associated with that term, along with the tools and techniques in existence and being developed to leverage it for decision making and improving the condition of living beings, firms and society. However, many are not clear on what are, or what is meant by the term, ‘Big Data’. The focus of this research was to explore the meaning of BD and to identify important paths of research on BD. As part of this process, we called upon a diverse set of marketing scholars who possess expertise and special insights. We discovered that different communities have different perspectives. It could be argued that they are all correct as they reflect the preferred perspectives of different communities. We find it helpful to think of BD as a term that represents a period of time or era, a process, and data that are from a variety of sources, of various structures or forms, and in a variety of locations.

"We aim to investigate the impact of marketing science articles and tools on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools, which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term ""marketing science value chain"" to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain.In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual - academic and practice - impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers.

These findings point to exciting opportunities for future research, including increased attention on enabling promises made to tourists and development of strategic and research principles; increased use of experimental, quasi-experimental and longitudinal research designs, as well as unstructured qualitative designs; and an increased focus on the study of actual behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Dolnicar S.; Ring A.,Strategic,10.1016/j.annals.2014.03.008,Big data; Marketing knowledge; Promise management; Tourism marketing; Tourism marketing knowledge grid,10.0,,5,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the creation of a Tourism Marketing Knowledge Grid and highlights the need for strategic principles in tourism marketing research, indicating a long-term focus on understanding cause-effect relationships and improving managerial decision-making.",scopus-big data,70,15,"Tourism marketing research: Past, present and future",2014
"Big data is here for some and coming for many. It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies.

"Personal data and its use have become the front-line of businesses in the digital market. With the potential to be extracted for information, making this available for various purposes, big data transforms into a powerful tool for data controllers for effective marketing, defining strategic business decisions, and establishing a strong foothold in the market. The use of personal data for targeted marketing exemplifies this. While privacy has been subject to the regime of privacy protection, privacy violation might entangle competition law analysis when it involves abuse of market dominance. This paper addresses these problems by discussing three key issues: first, how competition law addresses the use of personal data as the new frontier of innovation and competition; second, whether big data plays a role to qualify dominance; and third, if non-negotiable policy on privacy infringes the prohibition of dominance abuse under competition law. © 2017, T.M.C.

"The manufacturing sector is under constant pressure to increase profitability in a growingly competitive international market in which differentiation is not tied to manufactured products or utilized technologies but to business processes optimization. In this context, business analytics offer the opportunity to harness the knowledge and value hidden within enterprise information systems to revolutionize innovation, enhance supply chain management and production, accurately target marketing and sales efforts, as well as develop and manage profitable after-sales services. While the literature to date presents numerous specific applications in which business analytics techniques were successfully deployed to improve specific business units, it is evident that a comprehensive enterprise approach is missing. In the present work, a pathway to attain market leadership through the effective use of business analytics is defined suggesting focus must center on three increasingly challenging barriers. Firstly, “standardization” of collection, aggregation and storage of data must be accomplished. Then, an “organizational culture evolution” that outgrows intuition and embraces data-driven decision-making is needed to create the perfect ecosystem for business analytics to produce actionable results and recommendations. In turn, these must guide “business model innovation” efforts to tackle new value creation, and capture and secure market leadership. © 2019",Omar Y.M.; Minoufekr M.; Plapper P.,Strategic,10.1016/j.orp.2019.100127,Big data; Business analytics; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract focuses on long-term goals for organizations by emphasizing the need for standardization, culture evolution, and business model innovation, which are essential components of strategic planning.",scopus-big data,70,15,"Business analytics in manufacturing: Current trends, challenges and pathway to market leadership",2019
"Understanding geospatial demand for destinations can improve management decisions affecting destination planning, marketing, natural preservation, and resident as well as visitor experiences. Visualization and analysis of demand markets are significantly enhanced by the capabilities of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and help to support management objectives. This study implements traditional desktop GIS as well as a free, web-delivered decision-support tool for tourism planning and marketing to assess ~7.5 million overnight accommodation reservations made for federal recreational facilities between 1999 and 2007. Visitor origin frequency and median travel distance for overnight accommodations are summarized by visitor zip code and by facility. National results indicate: (1) facilities in the west, the Great Lakes and the southern Appalachians regions draw overnight visitors from the greatest median distances; (2) residents in the Northeast have the lowest per-capita utilization; (3) residents within the south-central Midwest and central-west Southern States have the highest percapita utilization and tend strongly toward local overnight reservations. Three selected national park regions are used to illustrate destinations characterized by highly localized utilization (Hot Springs National Park, AR), both local and regional utilization (Yosemite National Park, CA) and regionally to nationally dispersed utilization with few local residents reserving overnight accommodations (Canyonlands National Park, UT).

"We examined the relationship between management characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) and this relationship was differentiated by the level of corporate governance. Our analysis was undertaken in firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE) from 2006 to 2015. We employed Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression after clustering the standard errors at the firm level in order to examine these relationships. The KEJI (Korea Economic Justice Institute) index was used as a proxy for CSR and a big data-based proxy estimated from multimedia was used as the level of advertising. We showed that there is a positive relationship between overconfident management and CSR activities. We then categorized the CSR activities as primary and social activities and found that overconfident management is more aggressive in primary CSR activities. In addition, overconfident management makes fewer CSR expenditures when the management is in a chaebol firm but promotes more CSR advertisement. This finding indicates that chaebol affiliation controls overinvestment in CSR activities but promotes CSR advertisements by overconfident managers. Similarly, we found consistent results with overconfident ownermanagers. Prior literature on CSR activities focuses on the impact of CSR activities on firm performance. In this paper, we elucidated the determinants of CSR activities, so that this research contributes to firms' decision-making about sustainable management. Our estimation of CSR variables with big data approaches will also guide future research on this issue.

"The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: The number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments.

This study reveals several technologies and practices in agriculture that are based on big data for taking right decision at right time in right way at the field level. The study reveals that use of agricultural big data technologies are still a low level and needs more investment for infrastructure establishment, related expertise, technological knowledge of farmers, attitude of adoption of technologies and awareness about the benefits of big data technologies. It also explores that application of big data technologies can help farmer to weather forecasting, crop selection, irrigation management, crop diseases and pest management, crop yield prediction, agricultural marketing, and agricultural policy decision.

"Digitalisation opens new channels for fi nancial transactions. Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefi t from this advantage if competition between fi nancial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about fi nancial products and an appropriate degree of data security.

"The objective of this article is to develop a methodology in order to implement real-time customers segmentation analysis in the decision making process of the enterprise. A review of big data usage in retail stores was conducted along with a document-based descriptive analysis of secondary data and further critical literature analysis. Decision making strategies and flow charts were used for the development of competitiveness methodology by referring to a case of a supermarket chain. Customer segmentation researchers analyse mainly the algorithms or behaviour pattern behind the clustering process; however, neither of them offers a proper strategy for implementing a realtime customer segmentation process inside the enterprise. Sustainable competitiveness advantage may be achieved by implementing the segmentation theory with concepts of data mining and internet of things (Iot). The process of developed data mining shows many ways for the enterprise to maximize competitiveness. However, time and large investments may be required to develop proper methods for unique solutions. A concrete case study of the selected retail store should be analysed before implementing the real-time customer segmentation methodology inside the enterprise. There is a multicultural population in every market that has different culture, beliefs, preferences and shopping patterns; therefore, constant analysis is essential for efficient usage of customer segmentation.

"The chief marketing officer (CMO) and chief information officer (CIO) often fight for recognition and impact on strategic decision-making within the top management team–if they are included at all. Technological improvements have greatly increased the ability to gather customer data, which elevates the roles of the CMO and CIO while increasing their dependence on each other. The research on the relationship between senior executives outside of that with the CEO is limited; this paper fills that gap by exploring CMO/CIO cooperation. To analyze the dynamics of the CMO/CIO relationship, this research introduces a conceptual framework that captures three antecedents of cooperation: interdependence, CMO/CIO relationship structure, and CMO/CIO diversity. In cases in which dependence between the two executives is asymmetric, this paper proposes four cooperation mechanisms expected to mediate the relationship between these individual and organizational level antecedents and CMO/CIO cooperation.

"The role of marketing is evolving rapidly, and design and analysis methods used by marketing researchers are also changing. These changes are emerging from transformations in management skills, technological innovations, and continuously evolving customer behavior. But perhaps the most substantial driver of these changes is the emergence of big data and the analytical methods used to examine and understand the data. To continue being relevant, marketing research must remain as dynamic as the markets themselves and adapt accordingly to the following: Data will continue increasing exponentially; data quality will improve; analytics will be more powerful, easier to use, and more widely used; management and customer decisions will increasingly be knowledge-based; privacy issues and challenges will be both a problem and an opportunity as organizations develop their analytics skills; data analytics will become firmly established as a competitive advantage, both in the marketing research industry and in academics; and for the foreseeable future, the demand for highly trained data scientists will exceed the supply. © 2018 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

"Purpose: This paper aims to establish how strategic target-market selection decisions are shaped, challenged and driven in response to the rapidly evolving technological landscape. The authors critically evaluate the implications of these changes for the role of marketers and the organizational function of marketing. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses qualitative methods. Key-informant interviews are conducted among senior organizational practitioners within client-side organizations, digital agencies and strategic marketing consultancies, seeking to contrast their views. Findings: The findings reveal an erosion of responsibility for the integrated strategic role of marketing decision-making. In particular, the authors reveal that the evolving digital landscape has precipitated a sense of crisis for marketers and the role of marketing within the firm. This extends beyond simply remedying a skills-gap and is triggering a transformation that has repercussions for the future of marketing and its practice, thus diminishing functional accountability.

"In recent years, big data has emerged as one of the prominent buzzwords in business and management. In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sheng J.; Amankwah-Amoah J.; Wang X.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.06.006,Big data; Literature review; Management research,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the overarching theme of big data's impact on management and organizational strategy, including the need for firms to implement data-driven strategies for long-term goals and competitiveness.",scopus-big data,70,15,A multidisciplinary perspective of big data in management research,2017
"The contemporary economic environment is characterised by the economic megatrends that are (re)shaping economic practice in the 21st century. The most important megatrend is the digitalisation, which triggers a whole new economic revolution, so called ‘fourth industrial revolution’. In the situation with the new data source, new technological means for harvesting and processing of data, digitalisation and fourth economic revolution is very relevant not only for the operation but the marketing function as well. Social media represent an excellent source of data and channel of communication with the customer. Marketing spending on digital media platform soon will be no. 1, and it will overtake TV as the dominant marketing channel. Introducing the big data analytical capabilities, adjustment of overall organisation scheme and hiring competent personnel, the company will be in a position to save money for marketing spending, but in same time overall marketing performances will increase. Introducing big data analytical capabilities and efficient use of available social media platform is a challenging task that lay ahead of senior executives. Support from the highest management instances is the critical preconditions in reaching desired outcomes in the possible synergy between big data (BD) and social media marketing (SMM).

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess how the study of consumer behavior can benefit from the presence of Big Data. Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers a conceptual overview of potential opportunities and changes to the study of consumer behavior that Big Data will likely bring. Findings – Big Data have the potential to further our understanding of each stage in the consumer decision-making process. While the field has traditionally moved forward using a priori theory followed by experimentation, it now seems that the nature of the feedback loop between theory and results may shift under the weight of Big Data. Research limitations/implications – A new data culture is now represented in marketing practice. The new group advocates inductive data mining and A/B testing rather than human intuition harnessed for deduction. The group brings with it interest in numerous secondary data sources. However, Big Data may be limited by poor quality, unrepresentativeness and volatility, among other problems. Practical implications – Managers who need to understand consumer behavior will need a workforce with different skill sets than in the past, such as Big Data consumer analytics.

"People and the computers they use are generating large amounts of varied data. The phenomenon of capturing and trying to use all of the semi-structured and unstructured data has been called by vendors and bloggers ‘Big Data’. Organisations can capture and store data of many types from almost any source, but capturing and storing data only adds value when it has a useful purpose. Big Data must be used to provide input to analytics and decision support capabilities if it is to create real value for organisations. Some bloggers, industry leaders and academics have become disillusioned by the term Big Data. It is a marketing term and not a technical term. More descriptive terms like unstructured data, process data and machine data are more useful for information technology (IT) professionals.

"Purpose: While big data (BD), a transformative emerging phenomenon on its youth, plays a growing role in organizations in improving marketing decision-making, few academic works examine the mechanism through which BD can be applied to guide future competitive advantage strategies. The purpose of this paper is to examine if BD’s predictive power helps business to business (B2B) firms selecting their intended generic (differentiation, focus, and cost leadership) strategies. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the learning theory, the study proposes the use of BD as a key driver of intended strategies. Based on data from a cross-industry sample of executives, a conceptual model is tested using path and robustness analyses. Findings: The use of BD plays a prominent role in the selection of intended future strategies in industrial markets. Additional tests demonstrate conditions of competitive intensity and strategic flexibility where BD is more and less beneficial. Research limitations/implications: The study furthers the understanding of traditional learning and intelligence use frameworks and of contemporary future strategies drivers. Practical implications: BD availability enables managers leveraging knowledge embedded in data-rich systems to gain predictive insights that help in guiding new strategic directions to maintain competitive advantage. Originality/value: The study reinforces the continued applicability of Porter’s generic positioning strategies in the digital era. It addresses the paucity of research on BD in B2B context and is the first to provide theoretical and practical reflections on how BD utilization influences industrial intended strategies.

"One of the key issues in studies on customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing budget allocation is to calculate the customer's lifetime value and apply it to macro-management decisions. A major challenge in this issue is considering the possibility of changes in the behavior of customers with the turn of time in the model. In this study, a new approach has been used to estimate the parameters of the model proposed for calculating the future lifetime value of Iran Khodro Spare Parts and After-Sale Services Co. (ISACO) customers. This method takes into consideration the possibility of changes in customer behavior throughout their interaction with the company. In this article, the customers of ISACO are first classified using clustering techniques and use multilayer neural network to calculate the monetary value of each group of customers during a specific period of time. Then, the Markov chain approach is used to develop a model for calculating the lifetime value of ISACO's customers considering the possibility of changes in their behavior in different periods. The results obtained here can be used in the allocation of marketing budget and adoption of macro-management decisions to envisage various projects for customers with different lifetime values. © 2019 Iran University of Science and Technology.",Ashkezari M.S.; Albadavi A.; Ashkezari M.S.,Strategic,10.22068/ijiepr.30.4.429,Clustering; Customer lifetime value; Future value; ISACO; Markov chain; Neural network,5.0,,10,0,Iran University of Science and Technology,"The study focuses on calculating customer lifetime value and applying it to macro-management decisions, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and planning.",scopus-data mining,60,25,Presenting a model for calculating ISACO customers lifetime value by Markov chain using data mining techniques,2019
"The main objective of this research study is to investigate the extent to which business intelligence, competitive intelligence and marketing intelligence are used within the mining industry. Business intelligence, competitive intelligence and marketing intelligence are the management tools used to mine information to produce up-to-date intelligence and knowledge for operative and strategic decision making. A structured questionnaire is used for the study. A total of 300 mines are randomly selected from a research population of mining organizations in South Africa, Africa and globally. The respondents are all part of senior management. A response rate of 64% is achieved. The results indicat that more than half of the respondents do not have real-time intelligence and proper data mining tools to identify patterns and relationships within a data warehouse. Although a large proportion agrees that their organizations have systematic ways of gathering these different types of intelligence and use them for strategic decision making, there is a significant proportion that did not have any systems.

"In the travel and hospitality industries, categorization of products, brands, and experiences permits efficient comparison and evaluation that aids decision making—from consumer choice to organizational strategy. However, categories often involve self-categorization (e.g., marketer defined) that may not reflect the reality of dynamic markets and industries. In this study of the cruise industry, we derive a new categorization approach using consumer perceptions of their cruise experiences to challenge a long-standing industry typology. Results using a variety of statistical tests of J.D. Power data from more than 3,000 cruisers yield a new and more informative category structure and assignment of cruise lines to it.

"In light of the widely discussed political divide and increasing societal polarization, we investigate in this paper whether the polarization of political ideology extends to consumers’ preferences, intentions, and purchases. Using three different data sets—the publicly available social media data of over three million brand followerships of Twitter users, a YouGov brand-preference survey data set, and Nielsen scanner panel data—we assess the evolution of brand-preference polarization. We find that the apparent polarization in political ideologies after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 stretches further to the daily lives of consumers. We observe increased polarization in preferences, behavioral intentions, and actual purchase decisions for consumer brands. Consistent with compensatory consumption theory, we find that the increase in polarization following the election of Donald Trump was stronger for liberals relative to conservatives, and that this asymmetric polarization is driven by consumers’ demand for “Democratic brands” rather than the supply of such brands. From a brand perspective, there is evidence that brands that took a political stance observed a shift in their customer base in terms of their customers’ political affiliation. We provide publicly available (http://www.social-listening.org) access to the unique Twitter-based brand political affiliation scores. © 2022 The Author(s).",Schoenmueller V.; Netzer O.; Stahl F.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2022.1408,branding; data mining; political marketing; political polarization; social media,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of political polarization on consumer behavior and brand preferences, suggesting long-term trends in market dynamics and brand positioning.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the drivers of visitation intention, including demographic, psychographic (animosity, national attachment and consumer ethnocentrism) and image factors on tourist decision-making in a situation of bilateral conflict between the destination country and the source country, that is, the USA and Russia, respectively. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected at two different points in time from two different samples but analyzed with the same research question in mind. To increase the robustness and validity of findings, three analytical approaches from the repertoire of statistics and data mining techniques such as hierarchical linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree analysis were applied to two independent samples of tourists with different demographic profiles. This multiple methods research employs a complementary design, as methods used have equal importance and are applied concurrently. Findings: The paper obtained generally consistent results across methods and samples: general animosity, destination image and country image are the most influential factors in the tourists’ decision-making to visit a destination country with which their own country has strained bilateral relations. Practical implications: Destination image is highly important in all analyses and is more favorable than country image. It indicates some degree of separation of the two images in the respondents’ mind, which indicates that marketing a country as a tourist destination on a not-so-friendly tourism market may still be effective. Results also tentatively indicate that for young adults, patriotic feelings matter more in their decision-making, while for more mature tourists, ethnocentric tendencies play a more important role. Originality/value: The paper examines the influence of general and situational animosity, national attachment, and consumer ethnocentrism on visitation intentions in a situation of conflict between the two nations and, thus, expands the empirical evidence accumulated to date on tourist behavior in conflict. The paper acts on the premise that if a connection between any two variables truly exists, it should be able to withstand variations in samples, timing of data collection and measurement, thus, leading to more robust findings. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.",Stepchenkova S.; Kirilenko A.P.; Shichkova E.,Strategic,10.1108/IJTC-11-2018-0085,Animosity; Consumer ethnocentrism; Decision tree; Multiple methods research; National attachment,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of factors influencing tourist decision-making in the context of bilateral conflict, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and understanding market behavior.",scopus-data mining,60,25,Influential factors for intention to visit an adversarial nation: increasing robustness and validity of findings,2019
"Purpose – Today the garment industry in México is vulnerable to complex problems. This type of industry is subject to influences which over time, modify the perceptions of those involved in the design process due to the fact that they face problems that have both objective and subjective characteristics. In this study the authors used interviews, direct observation methodology, and theoretical argumentation to obtain the experts knowledge as they describe the problems that arise in the process of garment design for Mexican markets. The purpose of this paper is to generate a methodology so that the expert in this field will become highly specialized, resulting in heightened abilities and reinforcing them with the methodology of soft systems and the design management model (DMM). The results suggest that they are applicable to any area of design. Design/methodology/approach – The success or failure of expert system (ES) depends directly on the acquisition of knowledge (Méndez-Gurrola, 2007, 2012), to accomplish that, three large groups of techniques are used to extract that knowledge: manual, semiautomatic, and automatic. Within the group of manual techniques, interviews, protocol analysis, questionnaires, direct on site observation, and the extraction of closed curves are emphasized. This technique is chosen for its ability to extract the particular type of knowledge being sought. The knowledge of the dominion expert in the design process applied to the clothing industry in México is based on processes and at the same time is episodic, meaning that part of the procedure is automated and each step of the process triggers the next. This knowledge is also based on experience which is of an autobiographical nature. Findings – First, when one simulates human behavior, the hardest thing is to choose a knowledge representation that conforms as closely as possible to its emulation. According to, choosing a given type of knowledge representation is an art that is discovered little by little. And this is true as one designs and assembles a representation, when one realizes how far the authors are from imitating the design of the human brain processes, and discovers or invents methodologies to achieve it, combining the results of investigations into knowledge representation, cognitive psychology, and cognitive engineering. Second, solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process. One needs the ability to identify the signals emitted by complex situations, and being able to stop them in time before they create irreversible damage. By merging the soft system methodology (SSM) and DMM with the experts’ abilities and knowledge (the result being the EXITUS model (EM)), makes knowledge modeling possible. A problem cannot be solved if it is unknown, if the problem persists and grows it becomes more complex. By describing a problem, based on: its origin, its relationship, and its effects, it also confers the ability to solve it. Thereby, an SBC with the characteristics presented in this paper, not only improves the design process function as a whole, it also contributes to achieving corporate success. Finally, it influences directly on: a quality product; market positioning; and good economic results. First, the SBC-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the SBC-EXITUS system, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Fourth, in this project an SBC named SBC-EXITUS has been implemented using the SSM and the DMM, with the purpose of detecting possible problems in the design process of the clothing industry. Its implementation is developed by the use of production rules. Fifth, utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation thnique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to other areas of design. Practical implications – Utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation technique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to the garment industry in the international context, as well as to other areas of design such as architecture, furniture, and others. The EM is a generic methodology. In this research and case, it has been applied in a design process within the garment industry, specifically in a case in Mexico. Yet this does not limit its use in a different context and problem situation. Having in mind the difference between countries in aspects such as sponsoring, technology, worker skills, marketing, etc. the tools for diagnostics in the Appendix 2, may be adapted to each context with enriched questions directed to specific aspects involved. Every new application allows facts and production rules that make the use of ES more efficient. Social implications – The ES-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the ES-EXITUS, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Originality/value – Solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process.

"The report “Accenture China Consumer Insight 2018 - New Consumption Power” published by FT Chinese Network and Accenture, a well-known international consulting company, has poined out one of the characteristics of new consumerism: experience is paramount. Consumers' demand for experiential shopping has led to the formation of a new sales pattern, and the O2O sales model emphasizing experiential marketing has become a hot topic of common concern in the business and academic circles. The formulation of product quality level and sales service level strategies by enterprises is often affected by both consumers’ behaviors and supply chain members’ behaviors: On the one hand, considering the influence of the difference between the reference level and the actual experience level on consumer demand, this paper incorporates both the reference quality effect of online consumers and the reference service effect on offline channels into goodwill dynamics and demand function of consumers. On the other hand, supply chain members often do not comply with the assumption of “economic man” in traditional economics when they interact with each other, While they often have a certain social preference - reciprocity altruism, that is, they not only consider their own benefits, but also pay attention to each other's benefits to a certain extent. For this reason, this paper regards the utilities maximization of reciprocity altruism as the objectives of supply chain members when making decisions. To sum up, considering the inherent dynamics of supply chain operation and consumers’ reference effects in the supply chain system under O2O mode which is composed of a dominated manufacturer and a retailer selling through both online and offline, the differential game models among decentralized, centralized and reciprocal altruistic decision-making pattern are constructed by using differential game theory, manufacturer's quality level strategy, retailer's dominant service level strategy, and supply chain's profits and utilities are obtains among three decision-making modes. Through comparison, we find that: 1) The reference effects of consumers cause the “anchoring psychology”, which leads to manufacturers' lowering quality level, retailers' lowering service level, and also damages the performance of the product-service supply chain. 2) Consumer's channel preference has an important impact on supply chain members' strategies and performance. Retailers should encourage consumers to purchase products online and use offline channel services as sales assistance measures to satisfy consumers' experience utility. 3) Members' reciprocal altruistic behavior as a positive social preference can obtain Pareto improvement in supply chain performance compared with decentralized decision-making model. and also result in additional social benefits; 4) If and only if both manufacturer and retailer have pure altruistic behavior preferences, i. e. the lowest return and the highest altruism, the total profit of supply chain can reach the situation of centralized decision-making. To this end, the management inspiration of this paper is: due to many management drawbacks of centralized decision-making, such as high management costs and difficulty in implementation, supply chain members should actively display the social preferences of mutual benefit and altruism, and deepen the vertical cooperation of supply chain on the basis of independent decision-making. On the one hand, manufacturer can improve product quality through product innovation, strictly control product quality to enhance brand goodwill, form quality identity and lay a good quality foundation for retailer sales links. On the other hand, retailer should undertake the sales link of supply chain to serve consumers' experience consumption: recommending personalized products to customers at lower cost through advanced technologies such as data mining, setting up 24-hour online customer service, solving customers' pre-sale doubts, reducing the adverse effects of reference service in online channel. While in offline channel, he can establish a reasonable membership system, take feedback promotion activities regularly and feed old customers to improve their retention rate and loyalty, even use word-of-mouth effect to attract new customers and tap new consumer market potential. Through the mutual benefits and altruism of manufacturer and retailer, the supply chain division of labor can be carried out to comprehensively improve the quality level and service capacity from the production end to the sales end, build brand goodwill, and promote win-win situation in all channels. © 2021.

"Location analytics offers statistical analysis of any geo-or spatial data concerning user location. Such analytics can produce useful insights into the attractions of interest to travellers or visitation patterns of a demographic group. Based on these insights, strategic decision-making by travel marketing agents, such as travel package design, may be improved. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an original method of location analytics to analyse travellers' social media data for improving managerial decision support. The method proposes an architectural framework that combines emerging pattern data mining techniques with image processing to identify and process appropriate data content. The design artefact is evaluated through a focus group and a detailed case study of Australian outbound travellers. The proposed method is generic, and can be applied to other specific locations or demographics to provide analytical outcomes useful for strategic decision support. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.",Miah S.J.; Vu H.Q.; Gammack J.G.,Strategic,10.1142/S0219649219500047,geotagged data; location analytics; social media; Travel agency; travel marketing,5.0,,10,5,World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Purpose: Tourism development can reduce the economic disadvantages of indigenous tribes; however, it is also reproached for the destruction of local culture. The challenge for tourism and culture is to reach those diverse audiences through a multicultural marketing perspective for managers to make decisions. Therefore, learning the activity preferences of tourism experiences and creating the value of indigenous tourism by strategies are essential indicators of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The knowledge lacks cultural understanding and the acceptance of prices concerned with indigenous tourism. This research introduces the value of cultural experience into indigenous tourism experiences and establishes a link between the attributes of tourists' preferences and tourism. The data mining methods are used to analyze relevant indigenous tribal data on the cultural experience. Findings: By providing a different quality of service for various tourists, it is expected to improve the sustainable tourism of the tribe through the experiential value of different attributes and strategies of push–pull factors. Research limitations/implications: The experiential activities are based on second-hand data collected from Taitung's indigenous tourism activities, and sample data are the domestic tourism experiences of tourists over the past year.

"How to increase competitiveness of SMEs? How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews.

"Due to the proliferation of information systems and technology, businesses increasingly have the capability to accumulate huge amounts of customer data in large databases. However, much of the useful marketing insights into customer characteristics and their purchase patterns are largely hidden and untapped. Current emphasis on customer relationship management makes the marketing function an ideal application area to greatly benefit from the use of data mining tools for decision support.

"This article develops a more comprehensive understanding of data mining by examining the application of this technology in the marketplace. In addition to exploring the technological issues that arise from the use of these applications, we address some of the social concerns that are too often ignored. As more firms shift more of their business activities to the Web, increasingly more information about consumers and potential customers is being captured in Web server logs. Sophisticated analytic and data mining software tools enable firms to use the data contained in these logs to develop and implement a complex relationship management strategy. Although this new trend in marketing strategy is based on the old idea of relating to customers as individuals, customer relationship management actually rests on segmenting consumers into groups based on profiles developed through a firm's data mining activities. Individuals whose profiles suggest that they are likely to provide a high lifetime value to the firm are served content that will vary from that which is served to consumers with less attractive profiles. Social costs may be imposed on society when objectively rational business decisions involving data mining and consumer profiles are made. The ensuing discussion examines the ways in which data mining and the use of consumer profiles may exclude classes of consumers from full participation in the marketplace, and may limit their access to information essential to their full participation as citizens in the public sphere.

"As the higher education (HE) sector has expanded, so has the variety of courses on offer, with applicants now choosing between greater numbers of potential options. Where applications to HE are administered through centralised admission services, applicants will often make multiple initial course choices, which offers an opportunity to examine systematic groupings of interest within course choice sets, and assess whether certain types of student are more likely to make concentrated or diffuse subject selections. Utilising a national database of an entire cohort's application behaviour, the empirical findings presented in this article indicate that there are clusters of subjects that are applied for in combination, and that certain ethnic minority, socio-economic groups and neighbourhood types are more likely to make more diffuse subject choices. This creates an information base of generalised course choice behaviours that HE institutions could utilise for targeted marketing, recruitment and selection activities, and additionally forms the basis of a decision support framework that could be implemented in a variety of online tools to help guide student courses. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.",Singleton A.D.,Strategic,10.1057/jt.2009.13,"Data mining, marketing; Geodemographics; GIS; Higher education",5.0,,10,5,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,The abstract discusses the broader implications of course choice behaviors in higher education and how these insights can inform the long-term goals and strategies of higher education institutions for recruitment and marketing.,scopus-data mining,60,20,Data mining course choice sets and behaviours for target marketing of higher education,2009
"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the concepts of business intelligence (BI), knowledge management (KM) and analytical CRM (aCRM) and to establish a framework for integrating all the three to each other. The paper also seeks to establish a KM and aCRM based framework using data mining (DM) techniques, which helps in the enterprise decision-making. The objective is to share how KM and aCRM can be integrated into this seamless analytics framework to sustain excellence in decision making using effective data mining techniques and to explore how working on such aCRM system can be effective for enabling organizations delivering complete solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on focused and dedicated study of the literature present on the aCRM, KM and data mining techniques. The paper considered how to develop a strategy and operational framework that would build aCRM on the foundation of existing DM techniques and KM approach to meet the business challenges. Based on this research, a customized, integrated framework, to match the needs of business was designed. Findings: KM focuses on managing knowledge within the organization and aCRM focuses on gaining analytical information from the customer data. Both KM and aCRM help in the decision making process and understanding. This knowledge is difficult to uncover. Hence, this paper explains the importance of data mining tools and techniques to uncover knowledge by the integration between KM and aCRM. This paper presents an integrated KM and aCRM based framework using DM techniques. Research limitations/implications: All the firms may not be in favor of adopting KM while implementing aCRM. The KM requires a convalesce of organizational culture, technology innovations, effective work force in culminating knowledge dissemination in all business domains. Practical implications: The organizations implementing this knowledge enabled aCRM framework would be easily able to convert their business knowledge via the analytical CRM to solve many business issues, such as increase response rates from direct mail, telephone, e-mail, and internet delivered marketing campaigns, increased sales and increased services. With aCRM, firms can identify their most profitable customers and use this knowledge for promotional schemes for those customers as well as identify future customers with prediction on ROI.

"Decision making in marketing becomes more and more sophisticated and two important issues in marketing decisions are market segmentation and segment evaluation and selection. These decisions are two focal points of all companies which many strategies are followed or influenced by them. Decision making is based on information and data mining aims to extract useful information form implicit, unknown and raw data. Clustering techniques are one of the widely used data mining tools which have been used for dividing market into different segments. In recent years, numerous papers about using data mining or multi attribute decision making (MADM) for marketing decisions have been published. MADM tools are used as a natural approach for evaluating alternatives with respect to conflict criterion. Thus, this study aims to integrate these two fields for improving quality of market segmentation's decisions. The proposed methodology is a combination of data mining tools for market segmentation and MA DM tools for evaluation and selection of the best market. More precisely, clustering is used to divide a whole market into different segments. Two MA DM tools including, step-wise weight assessment ratio Analysis (SIVARA) and complex proportional assessment of alternatives with grey relations (COPRAS-G), were applied for market segment evaluation and selection. The most desirable features influencing the choice of a market segment evaluation and selection are identified based on literature study. Grey relation analysis allows incorporating the vague and imprecise information in to the decision model. A real-world data on a laptop market is put forward to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The proposed model could help companies to segment, evaluate and select the best market.",Aghdaie M.H.; Zolfani S.H.; Zavadskas E.K.,Strategic,,Clustering; COPRAS-G; Data mining; MADM; Market segment evaluation and selection; Market segmentation; SWARA,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses integrating data mining and multi-attribute decision making for improving market segmentation decisions, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",scopus-data mining,60,30,A hybrid approach for market segmentation and market segment evaluation and selection: An integration of data mining and madm,2013
"Purpose - The paper seeks to address the viability of planning and executing the integration of four often independent marketing information management techniques, i.e. competitive intelligence (CI), customer relationship management (CRM), data mining (DM) and market research (MR).

"As the economy has tightened, retailers have been challenged in recent years to be more strategic in their planning. They struggle to find answers to: • Who can I consider a loyal customer? • What kind of marketing strategy is most likely to increase sales? • What can customer-purchasing patterns reveal about improving inventory control? • What is the most effective way to manage customer relations to increase revenues? (Rabinovitch, 1999). With the exponential growth in the amount of data being collected, improvements in technology, and research in machine learning, retailers are now able to reduce the ever growing difficult and complex decision making process by recruiting the efforts of data mining (Barry & Linoff, 1997). Data mining is a computerized technology that uses complicated algorithms to find relationships and trends in large data bases, real or perceived, previously unknown to the retailer, to promote decision support. Currently being utilized by such retail giants as Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom, and Wal-Mart, Inc., data mining is touted to be one of the greatest technologies to hit the retailing industry this decade (Rabinovitch, 1999). The purpose of this study is to critique data mining technology in comparison with more familiar analytical tools for strategic decision making by small to medium size retailers.

"To improve the marketing activity and brand management and justify the most effective marketing decisions, organizations should implement different information technologies, mathematical methods and models into the marketing decision support system (MDSS). The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analysis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attracting new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing investments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and business indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports. The research findings offer a scientific basis for making effective marketing decisions based on data, and the proposed MDSS can become part of an intelligent system for planning marketing activities. © Galyna Chornous, Yana Fareniuk, Vincentas Rolandas Giedraitis, Erstida Ulvidienė, Ganna Kharlamova, 2023.",Chornous G.; Fareniuk Y.; Giedraitis V.R.; Ulvidienė E.; Kharlamova G.,Strategic,10.21511/im.19(2).2023.04,decision-making; enterprise; intelligent agent; marketing mix; marketing strategy; modeling; multi-agent system,5.0,,5,0,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,"The abstract discusses the formation of a marketing decision support system (MDSS) with long-term implications for marketing activities, brand management, and effective marketing decision-making through the use of data science tools.

"The article deals with the issue of a client's creditworthiness assessment in the insurance industry. The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of new factors which have relation to a client’s creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client’s creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry.

"Purpose - Time to market is the essential aim of any new product introduction process. Performance measures are simple quantities that indicate the state of manufacturing organisations and are used as the basis of decision-making at this crucial early stage of the process. Fuzzy set theory is a method for using qualitative data and subjective opinion. Fuzzy sets have been used extensively in manufacturing for applications including control, decision-making, and estimation. Type-2 fuzzy sets are a novel extension of type-1 fuzzy sets. Aims to examine this subject. Design/methodology/approach - This research explores the increased use of type-2 fuzzy sets in manufacturing. In particular, type-2 fuzzy sets are used to model ""the words that mean different things to different people"". Findings - A model that can leverage design process knowledge and predict time to market from performance measures is a potentially valuable tool for decision making and continuous improvement. A number of data sources, such as process maps, from previous research into time to market in a high technology products company, are used to structure and build a type-2 fuzzy logic model for the prediction of time to market.

"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to determine the convenience of using a contract model as an integration mechanism for decision-making in a decentralized supply chain of small agricultural producers in a developing country, taking as hypothesis coordinated chain achieves better management. The analysis is based on information obtained by direct inquiry to 99 small producers in the region, about planning, production, marketing and distribution in the chain, supplemented with secondary information sources. Design/methodology/approach: As a methodology an analysis of maturity in the chain based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration is done, whose evaluation is later analyzed as a fuzzy logic model, with the support of the fuzzy logic of the MATLAB toolbox, to study the convenience of the use of the contract against the other mechanisms, and to establish an approximation to the level of readiness of the chain toward integration. Findings: Results obtained show that the small farmer supply chain studied, from a maturity perspective, has a strong disposition for the use of contracts as an integration mechanism. Research limitations/implications: The supply chain for small producers presents a high dispersion, little consolidated offer capacity and lack of coordination. Limitations in terms of information and criteria unification are a challenge for future research. Results have socioeconomic implications for small producers and can serve as a guide to formulate policies by the governments in Latin American countries. Practical implications: As practical implications, it can be stated that the use of supply contracts is a real mechanism that can be implemented in this type of chain, to break the mistrust between the echelons and improve the supply chain performance. This research will allow to establish support programs from local governments for the sustainability and improving income of small producers. In addition, contracts will allow to formalize the linkage of small producers to a sustainable commercial network. Social implications: Small agricultural producers in developing countries live in unfavorable conditions, with socioeconomic limitations. This work offers an alternative for their productive activity development that will allow them access to marketing chains in a safe way and improve their living conditions.

"The managers spend most of their time to take critical decisions in each level of the organizational hierarchy. Basically, the decision process is to weight diverse alternatives each having the purpose to attain some of the desired objectives and to figure out the best solution in the complete challenging goals set. In today's rapidly changing and highly uncertain environment, the strategic decisions have an extremely complex and fuzzy nature. In the meantime, the enterprises have tendency to appreciate the new product development (NPD) activities so as to deal with the innovation in the new economy and to fulfill the customer demands adequately. The aim of this study is then to improve the accuracy of decision-making in NPD under uncertainty. We first identify the decision points in the NPD process and the uncertainty factors affecting those points.

"Purpose: In today’s intense global competition, agility is advocated as a fundamental characteristic for business survival and competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical methodology to achieve and enhance organizational agility based on strategic objectives. Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the organization being studied are recognized and classified under the perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC). Critical success factors are then identified by ranking the KPIs according to their importance in achieving organizational strategic objectives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In the second step, three houses of quality (HOQs) are constructed sequentially to identify and rank the main agile attributes, agile enablers, and improvement paths. In addition, in order to translate linguistics judgments of practitioners into numerical values in building HOQs, fuzzy logic is employed. Findings: The capability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a case of a multi-national food company in Iran. Through the application, the company could find the most suitable improvement paths to improve its organizational agility. Research limitations/implications: A limited number of KPIs were chosen due to computational and visual constraints related to HOQs. Another limitation, similar to other agility studies, which facilitate decision making among agility metrics, was that the metrics were more industry-specific and less inclusive. Practical implications: A strong practical advantage for the application of the methodology over directly choosing agility metrics without linking them is that through the methodology, the right metrics were selected that match organization’s core values and marketing objectives. While metrics may ostensibly seem unrelated or inappropriate, they actually contributed to the right areas where there were gaps between the current and desired level of agility. It would otherwise be impossible to choose the right metrics without a structured methodology. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel methodology for achieving organizational agility. By utilizing and linking several tools such as BSC, fuzzy TOPSIS, and quality function deployment (QFD), the proposed approach enables organizations to identify the most appropriate agile attributes, agile enablers, and subsequently agile improvement paths. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Nejatian M.; Zarei M.H.; Nejati M.; Zanjirchi S.M.,Strategic,10.1108/BIJ-09-2016-0147,Agile organization; Balanced scorecard; Enterprise agility; House of quality; Organizational agility; Quality function deployment,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a methodology for enhancing organizational agility, which is closely aligned with long-term strategic planning and decision-making.

"Relationship marketing considers customers as the main asset of organizations and the source of their profitability. Allocation of marketing budgets to these valuable assets is critical; because the way companies allocate their marketing budgets to customers affects their profitability. The purpose of this research is to provide a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments in a long-term view and a dynamic process. The contribution of the model is as follows: (1) unlike the previous modeling efforts where a predefined budget level was assigned to acquisition and retention, the suggested model sets and allocates marketing budgets simultaneously; (2) the model is multi-period which means the strategies for setting and allocation of marketing budgets may be different in each period. The proposed approach aims at maximizing customer equity in a long-term planning horizon with several periods. Decision variables determine how the budgets should be assigned to customer acquisition and retention in each period. Formulation of the model is followed by a numerical illustration. Since the model is nonlinear and non-convex, none of exact mathematical programming approaches may solve it. Therefore, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing approaches were employed. The results showed the effectiveness of the model compared with other extant models. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Koosha H.; Albadvi A.,Strategic,10.1007/s12351-017-0356-z,Budget allocation; Customer acquisition; Customer equity; Customer retention; Decision calculus; Genetic algorithm; Simulated annealing,5.0,,5,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments with a long-term view, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals.",scopus-genetic algorithm,70,20,Allocation of marketing budgets to maximize customer equity,2020

"Product line planning (PLP) aims at an optimal combination of product feature offerings, suggesting itself to be a determinant decision for a company to satisfy diverse customer needs and gain competitive advantages. Fulfilment of planned product lines must make trade-offs between product variety and production costs. To balance the costs of product lines, manufacturers often adopt a product platform configuration (PPC) approach to redesign product and process platforms by adding new modules to the legacy platforms. The PPC is an effective means of providing product variety while controlling the manufacturing costs. The PLP and PPC problems have traditionally been investigated separately in the marketing research and engineering design fields. It is important to coordinate PLP and PPC decisions within a coherent optimisation framework. This paper proposes a bilevel mixed 0–1 nonlinear programming model to formulate coordinated optimisation for platform-driven product line planning. The upper level deals with the PLP problem by maximising the profit of an entire product line, whilst the lower level copes with the multiple product platforms optimisation for the optimal PPC in accordance with the upper level decisions of product line structure. To solve this bilevel programming model, a bilevel genetic algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution. A case study of coordinated optimisation between an automobile line and its product platforms is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bilevel programming in comparison with a typical ‘all-in-one’ approach and a non-joint optimisation programming. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Miao C.; Du G.; Jiao R.J.; Zhang T.,Strategic,10.1080/00207543.2017.1294770,bilevel programming; coordinated optimisation; decision-making; design methods; product line; product platform,5.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract focuses on product line planning (PLP) and product platform configuration (PPC), which are long-term decisions aimed at optimizing product offerings and profitability.

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key technologies for the digital transformation of both business and society. The paper primarily aims to investigate the structure and dynamics of academic publications in English dealing with issues of IoT development – from a marketing perspective, using methods of systematic mapping, i.e., co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords in the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases. Analysis of research papers enables the identification of the most influential articles, papers, and journals, as well as visualization of the keywords and co-authorship co-occurrences. There has been an exponential increase in studies on IoT applications in marketing, indexed in Scopus and WoS citation databases.

"Servitization is a well-recognised phenomenon in the manufacturing industry. Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market. © The Operational Research Society 2022.",Chen K.-L.; Lassen A.; Li C.; Møller C.,Strategic,10.1080/0960085X.2022.2046515,action design research (ADR); business system; digital servitization; digital transformation; Internet of Things (IoT); resource-based view (RBV),5.0,,10,5,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses long-term transformations in a product-oriented manufacturing company towards a digital services business model.

"The automotive sector usually has a benefit due to commonality of vehicle parts, but planners still find it difficult to keep a balance. From one vendor to different vendors, they must meet niche demands. To keep a balance between these differences, cost effectiveness and ensuring product quality is a big challenge for them.

"The term “smart city” has recently become greatly widespread in academic and political discourse. Nevertheless, this is rather a marketing term that unites a number of technological (and other) areas: Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), communication networks. The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research. The results of the study can be used in further theoretical and applied research, in the formation of government policy in research and development, as well as in decision-making in the field of urban management. © 2019, Geographical Institute ""Jovan Cviji"" of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

"The newspaper industry in South Africa has been placed under severe pressure with the digital era in recent years. Circulation figures have dropped and profits have decreased. The influence of the Internet and news online could have a significant impact on the manner in which newspaper publishers generate revenue and profits in the future. If the current decrease in circulation continues, there could be as little as 750 000 newspapers in circulation in South Africa by the year 2020. The latest figures still confirm the decline in all classes of newspapers: daily newspapers, pdf replicas, weekly newspapers, weekend and free newspapers. The study shows that one-fifth of SA has partially or completely migrated to online news, which can be the dominant factor for the decrease in circulation rates. The dilemma manifests itself in South Africa’s traditional largest daily newspapers in an increasingly thinning newspaper versus higher than inflationary price increases. The latter culminates in price sensitive readers who respond by purchasing their favourite daily newspaper on selective days only. The Internet of Things in South Africa will grow exponentially as data costs decrease and Internet access improves so that online media usage will grow accordingly. The growing phenomenon of digital media is changing the market landscape significantly and could have dire consequences for the newspaper publisher who does not manage any migration strategically. Is this a case of the famous newspaper cliché: “stop the press!” – especially for Afrikaans daily newspapers? The Internet undermines newspapers’advertising revenues and news became a commodity that could dramatically change the traditional business model. From the contrasting market trends pointed out in the article, it is clear that this complex news ecosystem requires interaction with the readers to pinpoint future consumer journeys. A major challenge is advertisers who now reach larger audiences with digital and broadcast media at a much lower price than those of newspaper advertising. The worrying aspect for the industry is that a loss of advertising revenue in printed newspapers has not been supplemented by an increase in revenue for digital advertising on newspaper websites or online newspapers. Although most newspapers in the world already have an online version, the majority struggle to run it profitably. The news industry is therefore still looking for a sustainable business model. Market structures are constantly changing due to market dynamics. The article indicates that in a fully competitive market, the industry’s demand and supply determine the prevailing market price, and with the concentrated media market in South Africa, several strategies can be followed to win market share. In essence, the South African media industry is oligopolistic in nature. The growing presence of complementary and substitute products in the media industry for printed newspapers has caused significant changes with the ecosystems in terms of the quantity demanded versus changes in demand. Newspaper publishers in the new fragmented media market need to make strategic decisions for sustained growth and improved operational efficiency. In response to the challenges of newspapers, several strategic considerations are proposed – a series of consolidations are already happening in the industry with larger media houses that aggressively acquired smaller competitors. Mergers and acquisitions can provide traction to newspapers and rationalize the number of major players in the industry. The above implies changing business models that are adaptable for strategic considerations to increase subscription and advertising income levels and revenue from other avenues. The strategic options aim to realize greater scale, increasing circulation and income stability. A sustained factor for the printed newspaper is the existing brand value created. Confidence will play a more important role in today’s news landscape with its escalating fake news. The research found that trends in the printed newspaper market have yielded confusing results over the last few years. It represents a world of increasing openness, media diversity and complex choices on both sides of the market. The newspaper industry in South Africa is still navigating through the many variables and hence there is no single optimizing business model. The successful transformation of the printing industry with news as commodity will be driven by relevant research data. The demand for newspapers as a whole is under pressure due to a growing consumer empowerment for other substitutes. Undoubtedly, the industry in South Africa will also increasingly integrate print and digital operations into a hybrid model with the continuous pursuit of critical mass in a multi-channel marketing landscape. For Afrikaans newspapers it implies that the business model going forward needs to be more diversified. The newspaper industry is increasingly becoming a scale business and the overall characteristic is therefore a consolidation phase that strives for optimal mixtures between the various media formats. There is still a viable demand for the printed Afrikaans newspaper, but creative innovation is required to make it sustainable. In the end, it is still market forces that will be the major determinant and, by implication, the Afrikaans reader who is going to drive the quantity demanded. © 2018 South African Academy for Science and the Arts.

The IoT is expected to help the retailers in controlling the quality of food products, plan waste management of the items that have exceeded their shelf life, manage the temperature at the store, freezers and other equipment's contributing to the reduction of energy consumption. Despite the vast potential of IoT in food retail supply chains, the adoption of IoT is still in its nascent stage. Therefore, this study attempts to identify the various barriers that affect the adoption of IoT in the retail supply chain in the Indian context and also investigates the inter-dependences between the factors using a two-stage integrated ISM and DEMATEL methodology. Lack of government regulations and poor internet infrastructure were identified to be the significant drivers for IoT adoption. © 2019",Kamble S.S.; Gunasekaran A.; Parekh H.; Joshi S.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.02.020,DEMATEL; Internet of things; ISM; Multi-criteria decision-making technique; Retail supply chain,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of IoT adoption in retail supply chains, focusing on strategic goals such as improving operational efficiency and customer relationships.

"This study aims to propose and investigate the key factors that predict the Utilization of Green Internet of Things (U-GIoT) applications by business organizations. This study will also look at the effect of using GIoT applications on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, which in turn, contributes to the sustainable green performance. Therefore, value-belief-norm theory (VBN) was chosen as the theoretical basis for this study's conceptual model. Two constructs derived from VBN (i.e. biospheric value and ecological worldview) are suggested as key predictors for the use of GIoT applications. The conceptual model is extended by considering the role of green marketing orientation (GMO); green energy awareness; and energy knowledge/technical capabilities. The current model also suggests that the utilization of GIoT applications would impact both energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Online questionnaires are used to gather data from a purposive sample (n = 500) of managers and employees at different levels in different service organizations. Statistical results show strong evidence demonstrating the significant effect of biospheric value; ecological worldview; green marketing orientation (GMO); and energy knowledge/technical capabilities with GIoT. This study presents a valuable contribution that helps researchers; policy-makers, and practitioners to identify and understand the most important antecedents and consequences of U-GIoT. It is also worth noting for future studies looking at different applications of pro-environmental behaviour such as sustainable practices, green mobility and transportation, paperless work; recycling; reducing waste levels; and smart green solar. Policy-makers, decision-makers, practitioners and specialists in green energy systems (i.e. GIoT) will be able to use this information for future improvement. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Alalwan A.A.; Baabdullah A.M.; Dwivedi Y.K.; Al-Sulaiti K.I.; Khoualdi K.; Albanna H.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142956,Carbon footprint; Green IoT; Green marketing orientation; Value-belief-norm theory,5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on long-term implications of utilizing Green Internet of Things (GIoT) applications within organizations, aiming to enhance sustainability and energy efficiency.

"Industry 4.0 is the realization of digital transformation including enhanced productivity and flexibility due to real-time decision-making, which is possible due to the high-speed internet, the internet of things, and smart machines capable of autonomously exchanging information, triggering actions, and controlling each other independently. A high level of education and skills is increasingly more important in the job market over the next years necessitating finding a balance among behavioural, technological, analytical, and entrepreneurial skills. EU and governments worldwide should invest in closing the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education as this will directly impact the economic growth. Even though there is some progress in the hiring percentage of women in large technological companies, a clear glass ceiling in leadership roles is still remains. Here, we have undertaken a pilot study at University Complutense of Madrid (UCM, Spain) aimed at empowering women in academia to transition from the “publish or perish” paradigm towards creating and protecting their intellectual property to close the gender gap in STEM fields and leadership roles as well as training to fuel the development of innovative start-ups addressing societal challenges. A total of 20 participants inclusive of UCM staff and postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers were enrolled after successfully obtaining at least a score of 5 out of 10 in custom-made Entrepreneurial competency test provided by Business and Professional Women Association (BPW, Spain) and theGrowBox Innovation Ltd. The study, approved by the UCM ethical committee, was conducted after participants engaged and completed a training programme on “Enterpreneurship in STEM-related fields in Higher Education” aimed to introduce the participants to the entrepreneurial world. This involved a structured training programme covering the (i) business canvas design; (ii) development of minimum viable product (MVP); (iii) market evaluation; (iv) finance analysis using the Growbox platform; (v) introduction to venture capital; and (vi) human resources management followed by individual mentoring sessions prior completion of their business plans that were pitched to a panel of mentors and BPW representatives. Finally, all participants completed an anonymous survey of 12 open questions to evaluate the impact of the training in awakening the entrepreneurial spirit in academic researchers in Higher Education in STEM-related fields. Three-quarters of participants were novices in terms of Entrepreneurship, but all participants after the programme presented a complete business plan. The three points that women identified as prohibitive factors were lack of self-confidence, ambition, and knowledge in the fields of patent filing, finance and marketing. Participants were likely to initiate their own start-up in the next five years, but had mixed fillings regarding the complexity of the process. Nine months after the course ended, four out of 20 participants have been successful in attracting initial funding to support the initiation of a start-up involving protected intellectual property and managed to secure an award to provide them with office space to build their company. The long-term impact of this training programme will need to be followed up. Entrepreneurial training is crucial to be embedded in curricula for postgraduate and if possible undergraduate students to pursue a major transformation targeting the STEM-related fields in Higher Education to enable women in becoming key participants and leaders in the Industry 4.0 era. © 2023, The Author(s).",Serrano D.R.; Fraguas-Sánchez A.I.; González-Burgos E.; Martín P.; Llorente C.; Lalatsa A.,Strategic,10.1186/s13731-023-00346-4,"Higher Education; Industry 4.0; Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; Women entrepreneurship",5.0,,10,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The abstract discusses a long-term initiative aimed at empowering women in STEM and fostering entrepreneurship in academia, which aligns with strategic goals of creating lasting change in education and workforce participation.",scopus-Internet of Things,60,25,Women as Industry 4.0. entrepreneurs: unlocking the potential of entrepreneurship in Higher Education in STEM-related fields,2023
"Digitalization of marketing forms preconditions for personalization and individualization of advertising promotion of goods (works, services). Databases about consumer preferences and market situation are at the disposal of major international corporations, which makes it difficult for advertisers and admen. It is envisaged that the development of technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 6G cellular communication should change the situation in the field of processing and using information for accounting, management and marketing purposes. The purpose of the scientific research lies in optimization of accounting and international marketing in terms of determining income, expenses and, accordingly, profits from the lease of commercial and advertising space in all international participants of lease relations on the basis of information generated by innovative technologies of the Internet of Things and cellular communication of the sixth communication generation. In particular, the method of using technologies of the Internet of Things and 6G cellular networks was developed for obtaining information about the movement of visitors of commercial establishments and their consumer preferences. The procedure for recognition and accounting of all market participants’ income, expenses and, accordingly, financial results from the lease of commercial and advertising space has been developed, including operators of commercial establishments, advertisers, admen, and leasers. The organization of accounting the lease of commercial and advertising areas as part of international economic activity of enterprises has been optimized by providing international access to information and software and technical resources of the Internet of Things and cellular communication. Management decisions have been made as a reaction to information from a database about visiting commercial establishments. Based on the authors’ proposals, the order of circulation of accounting and management information and funds from buyers to operators of trade networks, trade establishments, advertising agencies and, finally, producers of goods (works, services) are proposed through the systems of international information relations that form a closed cycle of economic activity at the global level and require further scientific research. © 2023 The Author(s).",Zadorozhnyi Z.-M.; Muravskyi V.; Pochynok N.; Ivasechko U.,Strategic,10.34021/VE.2023.06.01(3),6G cellular communication; accounting; commercial and advertising areas; international economic activity; international marketing; lease profit; the Internet of Things,5.0,,10,0,Institute for International Cooperation Development,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of digitalization, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 6G communication in shaping international marketing and accounting practices.

"With contemporary life becoming more instantly connected and as the disruptiveness of technologies is occurring at a faster pace, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is now even more accessible and common, prompting companies to adopt IoT solutions to improve their customers' experiences. IoT enables physical devices to connect and exchange data through the Internet by collecting strategic information, thus creating opportunities for companies to become more efficient and responsive to market changes. This paper thus investigates how companies are blending IoT solutions into their relationship marketing strategies and focuses on finding how this combination can boost business performance and what the challenges are when dealing with disruptive technology changes. To explore the subject's detailed information and to get a better understanding of managerial decisions concerning IoT, this research conducts in-depth case design analysis from a company's point of view. The data presented herein come from two main sources: open-ended interviews and direct observations, with the interviewees holding high managerial positions in Taiwan's IoT industry. This study aims to contribute to the literature by bringing awareness to the importance of closely following technological trends in combination with relationship marketing strategies and how they help firms remain competitive and profitable. The results of this empirical research shed light on the importance of understanding the impacts of IoT solutions on businesses, especially on clients' behaviors and the development of targeted strategies. The cases herein present similarities on the awareness of the speed of disruptive technologies like IoT, the importance of developing new solutions aligned with new technologies, their impact at creating new business solutions, and their contribution to the development of firm strategies. The findings also show that the application of innovative IoT solutions positively affects the process of developing long and successful relationships through relationship marketing actions. Conversely, concerns related to data security vary according to business segments and relationship marketing pillars such as trust, commitment, and reliability, which could help reduce feelings of ambiguity. This research contributes to filling the gap in the literature by offering a deeper understanding of the correlation between IoT and relationship marketing. Moreover, we illustrate how a combination of these two factors can contribute to the development of stronger marketing strategies, as well as their implications on business. The results of this research suggest further and more comprehensive investigations are needed in the future in order to explore the topic in greater depth and to see how the speed of technology is evolving. © 2018",Lo F.-Y.; Campos N.,Strategic,10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.029,E-commerce; In-depth case study; Innovation; Internet-of-Things; IoT; Relationship Marketing,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses how companies are integrating IoT solutions into their relationship marketing strategies to enhance business performance and respond to technological changes, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategies.",scopus-Internet of Things,60,25,Blending Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions into relationship marketing strategies,2018
"China’s soybean spot price has historically been highly volatile due to the combined effects of long-term massive import dependence and intricate policies, as well as inherent environmental elements. The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy. After applying the decomposition part, the results have RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values of 49.59%, 22.58%, and 21.99% lower than those of the individual prediction part, respectively.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate perceptual differences between employees characterized by various levels of internal brand commitment and sustainability importance. The identified clusters of employees are compared considering the main determinants of internal brand commitment and their evaluations of a company’s sustainability performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted among employees of industrial companies operating in Belarus. Two hundred thirty-eight responses were analyzed by using the K-means cluster analysis. The analysis of variance was applied for evaluating differences between the three identified clusters. Findings: Based on internal brand commitment and sustainability importance, the paper identifies three alternative clusters of employees: uncommitted sustainability laggards, committed sustainability followers and committed sustainability leaders. The results show that the three clusters differ in regard to the main determinants of internal brand commitment, which are brand orientation, internal brand knowledge and internal brand involvement. The findings demonstrate significant perceptual differences between the three clusters regarding their evaluations of a company’s sustainability performance. The assessment of sustainability performance focuses on sustainability objectives, sustainability policies and sustainability decision-making and disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in the context of a transition economy. Future studies are recommended to develop a cross-cultural comparison of relationships between employees’ perceptions about sustainability performance, different determinants and the outcomes of internal brand commitment.

"The effects of the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis call for more active support for the tourism industry. To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism. This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy. The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method - decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies. © This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Polyakov M.; Bilozubenko V.; Nebaba N.; Korneyev M.; Saihak Y.,Strategic,10.21511/im.16(4).2020.10,Asymmetry factors; Country clustering; Marketing strategy; Supranational policy; Tourism,5.0,,5,0,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,"The abstract discusses long-term objectives for the tourism industry, including the formation of marketing strategies and identifying competitiveness drivers across EU countries, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-k-means,70,20,Analysis of asymmetry factors in the development of the EU tourism industry,2020

"Purpose- Nowadays, managers achieve superior performance and greater efficiency by evaluating their firm's readiness for mass customization before committing their company to such a strategy. The purpose of this article is to handle this issue by proposing a managerial framework- named FIRM- for firm profiling, which offers the strategic shift toward mass customization concept. The aim is to provide a tool for executives, which helps them discuss strengths and weaknesses in the internal production and information technology areas before utilizing these policies. Design/methodology/approach- The research procedure consists of measurement scales generation, data gathering, purification phase, firm clustering and profiling. Using Delphi method and brainstorming sessions, a questionnaire is developed, pretested and administered for a firm's profiling in today's marketing and production environment. Findings- A validation test of FIRM is presented and satisfactory levels of Cronbach's α are obtained at the end of the purification process. The results lead us to believe that the five-dimension structure of FIRM may be reduced to a four-dimension construct. Using k-means cluster analysis results, three different groups of firms are founded. We claim that FIRM would help strategic decision-makers to identify the particular policies and configurations necessary for their business. Clear directions on how to manage customization policies for each firm belonging to special cluster is provided.

"Accurately predicting the sales trajectory of a product in its life cycle is critically important for firms’ medium- and long-term planning. Because classic product-diffusion models such as the Bass model consider only initial product purchases, they are ill-fitted for sales prediction for today’s technology products with a shorter life cycle and frequent repeat purchases or subscription renewals. Despite the long tradition of product diffusion research, there exists no viable model option when repeat purchases constitute a large proportion of product sales. The present study introduces a new sales growth model, termed the generalized diffusion model with repeat purchases (GDMR), to fill this void. The GDMR formulates the growth rate of sales using a noninteger-order integral equation rather than the integer-order differential equation typically adopted in existing diffusion models. The GDMR is parsimonious and easy to implement. Empirical results show that the GDMR fits sales data with varying proportions of repeat purchases quite well, making it suitable for predicting sales of a wide variety of products. In addition, the GDMR can be extended to incorporate marketing mix variables, thus enhancing its applicability in business decision making. Furthermore, using both real and simulated data, we show that the GDMR can reliably recover a product’s adoption trend using only sales data, thus cementing its theoretical validity and empirical effectiveness. Finally, we show that the GDMR is superior to generic time series and machine learning models in predicting future product sales. 2022 INFORMS.",Lotfi A.; Jiang Z.; Lotfi A.; Jain D.C.,Strategic,10.1287/isre.2022.1131,diffusion of innovations; fractional calculus; multiunit ownerships; repeat purchases; replacements,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the development of a new sales growth model to predict long-term sales trajectories, which aligns with strategic planning aimed at defining organizational goals and adapting to changing market conditions.",scopus-machine learning,60,30,Estimating Life Cycle Sales of Technology Products with Frequent Repeat Purchases: A Fractional Calculus-Based Approach,2023
"A strategic market intelligence mechanism is essential for stakeholders to make well-informed decisions on production, pricing, and marketing strategies; however, the complex behaviour of agricultural markets, coupled with the presence of non-stationarity, non-normality, and non-linearity in the arrivals and prices of perishable agricultural commodities pose challenges for traditional statistical models in modelling and forecasting. This study sought to overcome these challenges by employing machine learning and hybrid models for vegetable crops. Machine learning techniques, known for their flexibility with non-stationary, non-normal, and non-linear data, were showcased in the empirical illustration, highlighting their effectiveness. The trends of arrivals and prices were found to be significantly positive (p<0.01) for tomato and capsicum. Time delay neural network (TDNN) and hybrid models outperformed the seasonal ARIMA models based on lower RMSE and MAPE for the modelling and forecasting. Utilizing the best-fit models, the prices of tomato and capsicum were forecasted to be highest during June 2024 with ₹2267 and 2623 per q.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the concept of distrust of traditional banking institutions as a factor that can explain the choice to remain unbanked in a marketplace that is designed to be financially inclusive. Design/methodology/approach: Earning, spending, saving and borrowing data collected between May 2021 and February 2022 from 17,819 consumers living in the United States were used to examine the factors associated with distrust of banks. Using a conceptual framework borrowed from the health services profession, the study was conducted in two stages. At the first stage, distrust among the unbanked and banked was estimated using a Boruta-random forest algorithm. At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis. Findings: Results from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked. Research limitations/implications: This study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field.

Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Gao H.; Liu H.; Ma H.; Ye C.; Zhan M.,Strategic,10.1108/APJML-12-2020-0872,Credit scoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power-law distribution; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the development of a robust credit scoring system that leverages multi-source data in the context of telecom operators.

"Purpose: This study aims to examine the technical efficiency of the chemical-free farming system in India using a hybrid combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the efficiency scores of decision-making units’ efficiency (DMUs) are obtained using an input-oriented DEA model under the assumption of a variable return to scale. Based on these scores, the DMUs are classified into efficient and inefficient categories. The 2nd stage of analysis involves the identification of the most important predictors of efficiency using a random forest model and a generalized logistic regression model. Findings: The results show that by using their resources efficiently, growers can reduce their inputs by 34 percent without affecting the output. Orchard's size, the proportion of land, grower's age, orchard's age and family labor are the most important determinants of efficiency. Besides, growers' main occupation and footfall of intermediaries at the farm gate also demonstrate significant influence on efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The study used only one output and a limited set of input variables. Incorporating additional variables or dimensions like fertility of the land, climatic conditions, altitude of the land, output quality (size/taste/appearance) and per acre profitability could yield more robust results. Although pineapple is cultivated in all eight northeastern states, the data for the study has been collected from only two states. The production and marketing practices followed by the growers in the remaining six northeastern states and other parts of the country might be different. As the growers do not maintain farm records, their data might suffer from selective retrieval bias. Practical implications: Given the rising demand for organic food, improving the efficiency of chemical-free growers will be a win-win situation for both growers and consumers. The results will aid policymakers in bringing necessary interventions to make chemical-free farming more remunerative for the growers. The business managers can act as a bridge to connect these remote growers with the market by sharing customer feedback and global best practices. Social implications: Although many developments have happened to the DEA technique, the present study used a traditional form of DEA. Therefore, future research should combine ML techniques with more advanced versions like bootstrap and fuzzy DEA. Upcoming research should include more input and output variables to predict the efficiency of the chemical-free farming system. For instance, environmental variables, like climatic conditions, degree of competition, government support and consumers' attitude towards chemical-free food, can be examined along with farm and grower-specific variables. Future studies should also incorporate chemical-free growers from a wider geographic area. Lastly, future studies can also undertake a longitudinal estimation of efficiency and its determinants for the chemical-free farming system. Originality/value: No prior study has used a hybrid framework to examine the performance of a chemical-free farming system. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Paul U.K.,Strategic,10.1108/BIJ-08-2021-0494,Chemical-free farming; Data envelopment analysis; Machine learning; Technical efficiency,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The study aims to improve the efficiency of chemical-free farming, which aligns with long-term goals of enhancing agricultural practices and market connections for growers.

"It is complex to explain how sustainable tourism indicators are incorporated in the governance structures of destination marketing/management organisations (DMMOs) to inform policymaking. This paper develops realist evaluation methods to explain under which conditions four European DMMOs adopt a relevant group of indicators (acquisition), to provide meaning to these indicators (assimilation), which creates the conditions to make indicator-informed decisions (transformation) that can eventually generate benefits attributable to the use of indicators (exploitation). The methodological novelty of this paper is the use of outcome mapping to systematically outline the process of data collection and analysis to reach the context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining the factors that facilitate or impede the absorptive capacity in these DMMOs. Interventions to increase the uptake of sustainability indicators need to create better opportunities for DMMOs’ formal and informal learning; to use indicators to disrupt prevalent mindsets; with easily understandable data that is perceived as relevant to their needs. © 2023 The Authors",Torres-Delgado A.; Font X.,Strategic,10.1016/j.tourman.2023.104879,Absorptive capacity; Destination marketing/management organisations; Evidence-based policy; Outcome mapping; Sustainable tourism indicator,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the incorporation of sustainable tourism indicators into the governance structures of destination marketing/management organizations (DMMOs) and explores long-term implications for policymaking and decision-making processes, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-machine learning,70,15,Outcome mapping the absorptive capacity of destination marketing/management organisations to use sustainability data to inform policy,2024
"Purpose: In a volatile agricultural postharvest market, producers require more personalized information about market dynamics for informed decisions on the marketed surplus. However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Tripathi P.K.; Singh C.K.; Singh R.; Deshmukh A.K.,Strategic,10.1108/BIJ-12-2021-0780,Agricultural decision support system; Agricultural supply chain; Market intelligence system; Optimal marketing strategy; Predictive modelling; Risk management,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses designing an Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) aimed at long-term strategic planning for crop producers facing volatile postharvest markets.

"Sentiment analysis has demonstrated its value in a range of high-stakes domains. From financial markets to supply chain management, logistics, and technology legitimacy assessment, sentiment analysis offers insights into public sentiment, actionable data, and improved decision forecasting. This study contributes to this growing body of research by offering a novel multi-view deep learning approach to sentiment analysis that incorporates non-textual features like emojis. The proposed approach considers both textual and emoji views as distinct views of emotional information for the sentiment classification model, and the results acknowledge their individual and combined contributions to sentiment analysis. Comparative analysis with baseline classifiers reveals that incorporating emoji features significantly enriches sentiment analysis, enhancing the accuracy, F1-score, and execution time of the proposed model. Additionally, this study employs LIME for explainable sentiment analysis to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enabling high-stakes businesses to understand the factors driving customer sentiment. The present study contributes to the literature on multi-view text classification in the context of social media and provides an innovative analytics method for businesses to extract valuable emotional information from electronic word of mouth (eWOM), which can help them stay ahead of the competition in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In addition, the findings of this paper have important implications for policy development in digital communication and social media monitoring.

"This article introduces algorithmic bias in machine learning (ML) based marketing models. Although the dramatic growth of algorithmic decision making continues to gain momentum in marketing, research in this stream is still inadequate despite the devastating, asymmetric and oppressive impacts of algorithmic bias on various customer groups. To fill this void, this study presents a framework identifying the sources of algorithmic bias in marketing, drawing on the microfoundations of dynamic capability. Using a systematic literature review and in-depth interviews of ML professionals, the findings of the study show three primary dimensions (i.e., design bias, contextual bias and application bias) and ten corresponding subdimensions (model, data, method, cultural, social, personal, product, price, place and promotion).

"Given the pervasive ubiquity of data, sales practice is moving rapidly into an era of predictive analytics, using quantitative methods, including machine learning algorithms, to reveal unknown information, such as customers’ personality, value, or churn probabilities. However, many sales organizations face difficulties when implementing predictive analytics applications. This article elucidates these difficulties by developing the PSAA model—a conceptual framework that explains how predictive sales analytics (PSA) applications support sales employees’ job performance. In particular, the PSAA model conceptualizes the key contingencies governing how the availability of PSA applications translates into adoption of these applications and, ultimately, job performance. These contingencies determine the extent to which sales employees adopt these applications to revise their decision-making and the extent to which these updates improve the decision outcome. To build the PSAA model, we integrate literature on predictive analytics and machine learning, technology adoption, and marketing capabilities. In doing so, this research provides a theoretical frame for future studies on salesperson adoption and effective utilization of PSA. © 2023, The Author(s).",Habel J.; Alavi S.; Heinitz N.,Strategic,10.1007/s13162-022-00252-0,Advanced analytics; Machine learning; Personal selling; Predictive analytics; Sales force effectiveness; Sales management,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the development of a conceptual framework (PSAA model) that addresses long-term goals related to the adoption of predictive analytics in sales organizations.

"The demand for urban delivery services (UDS) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been growing due to the spike in e-commerce activities. This phenomenon has led to the search for more innovative UDS modes, such as drones, as they provide fast, safer, and eco-friendly services. Although researchers have examined the perceptions regarding the adoption of drone delivery, there are many unknowns about the intentions to use this futuristic delivery mode. By employing survey data obtained through an online survey conducted in Ghana, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the current UDS user profiles and investigate their intentions to adopt drone deliveries in the future, considering the lived experiences of traditional UDS usage pre/post the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding UDS user profiling, the study applied an advanced unsupervised machine learning method known as cluster correspondence analysis to simultaneously identify critical clusters in the data as well as key factor associations for each group. The findings demonstrated that most people in Ghana who seldom used the traditional UDS usually experienced poor service levels. Females living in the capital of Ghana who are frequent users of UDS mainly experienced acceptable service levels. Using an ordered probit regression model, the study identified that variables such as males, people who desired contactless UDS, and frequent UDS users at work or school during the COVID-19 pandemic were more inclined to embrace drone deliveries when introduced. Conversely, individuals who frequently used UDS services at home, those living in large cities, and those with lower income levels expressed reluctance toward drone delivery services. This study augments the urban logistics literature in LMICs by offering insightful suggestions in the areas of education, enhanced marketing strategies, and delivery optimization, which are instrumental for informing policy decisions.

"Identifying the determinants of firms' investment in knowledge, this study first explores the heterogeneous impacts of research and development (R&D) on product, process, organization, and marketing innovation. Second, it examines if there exists a complementary (substitute) relation in terms of firms' preference between four types of innovation. Studying 1500 firms of seven developing economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a machine learning-based regression, to identify key predictors likely to influence firms' R&D propensity and intensity. Estimating the knowledge function, we found-in line with LASSO-that medium-sized firms, human capital (training) and credit facilities favorably affect firms' decision to invest in R&D. Contrarily, the impact is adverse if the first or main product generates firms' large share of revenue, a unique finding not captured by previous studies. The marginal effects of four univariate probit models indicate that firms' investment in R&D translates into innovation. However, the application of the Geweke-Hajivassiliour-Keane (GHK)-simulator based multivariate probit, which considers simultaneity of firms' innovation decisions that univariate probit ignores, suggests that the relationship between different types of innovation is complementary. Firms' strategy to adopt a particular type of innovation is influenced by other types. This led to the estimation of R&D's impact on technological and nontechnological innovation, which shows that while firms innovate both types, there is a skewed link between nontechnological innovation and the services sector. © 2020 by the author.",Zhang J.; Islam M.S.,Strategic,10.3390/su12041643,LASSO; Multivariate probit; Nontechnological innovation; R & D; Technological innovation; Tobit,5.0,,10,5,MDPI,"The abstract discusses the determinants of firms' investment in R&D and their implications for various types of innovation, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and defining organizational goals.",scopus-machine learning,60,20,The heterogeneous impacts of R&D on innovation in services sector: A firm-level study of developing ASEAN,2020

"This study addresses the following question: For a given managerial, firm, and industry setting, which individual metrics are effective for making marketing-mix decisions that improve perceived performance outcomes? We articulate the key managerial takeaways based on testing a multi-stage behavioral framework that links decision context, metrics selection, and performance outcomes. Our statistical model adjusts for potential endogeneity bias in estimating metric effectiveness due to selection effects and differs from past literature in that managers can strategically choose metrics based on their ex-ante expected effectiveness. The key findings of our analysis of 439 managers making 1287 decisions are that customer-mindset marketing metrics such as awareness and willingness to recommend are the most effective metrics for managers to employ while financial metrics such as target volume and net present value are the least effective. However, relative to financial metrics, managers are more uncertain about the ex-ante effectiveness of customer-mindset marketing metrics, which attenuates their use. A second study on 142 managers helps provide detailed underlying rationale for these key results.

"This article highlights how social media data and language analysis can help managers understand brand positioning and brand competitive spaces to enable them to make various strategic and tactical decisions about brands. The authors use the output of topic models at the brand level to evaluate similarities between brands and to identify potential cobrand partners. In addition to using average topic probabilities to assess brands’ relationships to each other, they incorporate a differential language analysis framework, which implements scientific inference with multi-test-corrected hypothesis testing, to evaluate positive and negative topic correlates of brand names. The authors highlight the various applications of these approaches in decision making for brand management, including the assessment of brand positioning and future cobranding partnerships, design of marketing communication, identification of new product introductions, and identification of potential negative brand associations that can pose a threat to a brand's image. Moreover, they introduce a new metric, “temporal topic variability,” that can serve as an early warning of future changes in consumer preference.

"In recent years, global urbanization and overdevelopment have resulted in environmental degradation and an energy crisis. Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed.

"The article materials are accented to the identification of the concept of the innovative culture of personnel management and the possibility of implementing universal project management methods in its formation. The urgency of the research is determined, first of all, by the need for a constant dynamic correction of techniques and instrument management personnel in order to build an innovative culture of personnel management at domestic enterprises. When writing, analytical and statistical methods are used during the detection and processing of domestic and foreign statistical data, the method of expert assessments in the formation of structural models, historical and logical methods in the extrapolation of the state of the past years for the future. The article materials emphasize the definition and characteristics of the concept of «Innovative Culture of Personnel Management». It is determined that the practical implementation of the instrument of the personnel management of the enterprise needs to use innovative techniques. Among these techniques, it is crucial to underscore Gantt charts, the Dupon method and Game Theory, personal marketing management, and others. Particular attention is focused on a graphical display of a Gantt chart, which reflects the time interval from the time of decision-making on the introduction of innovative methods in managing personnel to increase labor productivity and the growth of other enterprise performance indicators. It is noted that when making decisions on the expediency of changing the existing personnel management culture at the enterprise, it is worth using neural network models based on which it is possible to reveal a causal relationship between the decision and the reaction of the entire organizational system or a separate personality. It is detected that one of the main methods of investigation of the probable results from the introduction of an innovative culture of personnel management at the enterprise is to identify strengths and weaknesses in the process of implementing changes. The study of the LIFT methodological approach that uses the tools of ballroom assessments of the groups of attractiveness indicators of decisions on introducing an innovative personnel management culture and indicators that determine their risks are distinguished.

"Bidding for international construction projects is a critical decision for companies that aim to position themselves in the global construction market. Determination of attractive projects and markets where the competitive advantage of a company is high requires extensive environmental scanning, forecasting, and learning from the experience of competitors in international markets. In this paper, a neuronet model has been developed as a decision support tool that can classify international projects with respect to attractiveness and competitiveness based on the experiences of Turkish contractors in overseas markets. The model can be used to guide decision makers on which type of data should be collected during international business development and further help them to prepare priority lists during strategic planning. Information derived from the model demonstrates that the most important factors that increase attractiveness of an international project are availability of funds, market volume, economic prosperity, contract type, and country risk rating. Similarly, level of competition, attitude of host government, existence of strict quality requirements, country risk rating, and cultural/religious similarities are the most important factors that affect competitiveness of Turkish contractors in international markets.",Dikmen I.; Birgonul M.T.,Strategic,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:1(59),Bids; Construction industry; Contractors; Foreign projects; Neural networks; Turkey,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a decision support tool for classifying international construction projects, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and understanding competitive advantages in global markets.",scopus-neural network,60,25,Neural network model to support international market entry decisions,2004
"As part of the increasing efforts toward the prevention and control of motor vehicle pollution, the Chinese government has practiced a range of policies to stimulate the purchase and use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Zhejiang Province, a key province in China, has proactively implemented and monitored an environmental protection plan. This study aims to contribute toward streamlining marketing and planning activities to introduce strategic policies that stimulate the purchase and use of BEVs. This study considers the nature of human behavior by extending the theory of planned behavior model to identify its predictors, as well as its non-linear relationship with customers' purchase intention. To better understand the predictors, a substantial literature review was given to validate the hypotheses. A quantitative study using 382 surveys completed by customers in Zhejiang Province was conducted by integrating a structural equation model (SEM) and a neural network (NN). The initial analysis results from the SEM revealed five factors that have impacted the customers' purchase intention of BEVs. In the second phase, the normalized importance among those five significant predictors was ranked using the NN. The findings have provided theoretical implications to scholars and academics, and managerial implications to enterprises, and are also helpful for decision makers to implement appropriate policies to promote the purchase intention of BEVs, thereby improving the air quality. © 2019 by the authors.",Xu Y.; Zhang W.; Bao H.; Zhang S.; Xiang Y.,Strategic,10.3390/su11113164,Battery electric vehicles; Neural network; Purchase intention; Structural equation model; Theory of planned behavior,5.0,,5,0,MDPI,"The study aims to contribute toward the long-term planning and strategic policies to stimulate the purchase and use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), indicating a focus on overarching goals and the nature of environmental protection in the context of vehicle pollution.",scopus-neural network,70,20,A SEM-neural network approach to predict customers' intention to purchase battery electric vehicles in China's Zhejiang Province,2019

"Purpose: Recent studies have observed rise in consumer’s ethical concerns about the online retailers while making a purchase decision. The impetus for businesses to use corporate social responsibility (CSR) is evident, but the effects of CSR motives on corresponding processes underlying cause-related marketing (CRM) patronage intention have not been thoroughly examined. This study, anchored on attribution theory, established a research model that better explains the influence of CSR motives on patronage intentions toward CRM-oriented online retailers. Additionally, this study aims to examine the moderating role of spirituality (SPT) on CSR motives and CRM patronage intention (CPI). Design/methodology/approach: Primary data has been collected from 722 respondents and analyzed by using deep neural-network architecture by using the innovative PLS-SEM-ANN method to predict/rank the factors impacting CPI. Findings: The results revealed the normalized importance of the predictors of CPI and found that value-driven motive was the strongest predictor, followed by strategic motive, SPT, age and stakeholder-driven motive. In contrast, egoistic motive, education and income were found insignificant. Originality/value: The pandemic has transformed the way consumers shop and fortified the online economy, thereby resulting in a paradigm shift toward usage of e-commerce platforms. The results offer valuable insights to online retailers and practitioners for predicting patronage intentions by CSR motives and, thus, effectively engage CRM consumers by designing promotions in a way that would deeply resonate with them.

"Leasing is a popular channel for marketing new cars. However, the pricing of leases is complicated because the leasing rate must embody an expectation of the car's residual value after contract expiration. This paper develops resale price forecasting models in order to aid pricing decisions. One feature of the leasing business is that different forecast errors entail different costs. The primary objective of this paper is to identify effective ways of addressing cost asymmetry. Specifically, this paper contributes to the literature by (i) consolidating prior work in forecasting on asymmetric functions of the cost of errors; (ii) systematically evaluating previous approaches and comparing them to a new approach; and (iii) demonstrating that forecasting using asymmetric cost of error functions improves the quality of decision support in car leasing. For example, if the costs of overestimating resale prices are twice those of underestimating them, incorporating cost asymmetry into forecast model development reduces costs by about 8%. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters",Dress K.; Lessmann S.; von Mettenheim H.-J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.01.008,Asymmetric cost of error; Automotive industry; Ensemble learning; Neural networks; Quantile regression,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The paper focuses on developing forecasting models to aid pricing decisions in car leasing, indicating long-term strategic planning to improve decision support systems related to pricing and residual value expectations.",scopus-neural network,70,20,Residual value forecasting using asymmetric cost functions,2018
"India has become one of the world's largest gaming destinations, and in the last few years, the rapid rise of online gaming has led to the domination of fantasy sports gaming platforms. Very little is understood about how users on fantasy sports gaming platforms perceive and approach giving and what essentially matters to users before selecting or engaging with such fantasy sports gaming platforms. This study aims to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards fantasy sports gaming platforms by examining philanthropic actions, well-being (WB) and flow experience (FE). A large-scale research study on 2091 samples was undertaken by adopting three-fold SEM-ANN-NCA (structural equation modeling-artificial neural network-necessary condition analysis) for establishing and empirically testing a comprehensive model by integrating philanthropic actions, WB and FE to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards online fantasy sports gaming platforms. The findings add depth to our understanding of philanthropic actions linked to fantasy sports gaming platforms and users' loyalty and donation intentions towards such platforms. The results of ANN indicated the normalized importance of the predictors of user loyalty and found that philanthropic action was the strongest predictor. Likewise, philanthropic actions, WB, and FE were necessary conditions (must-have) to determine user loyalty during NCA. The findings would provide invaluable intelligence to fantasy gaming companies to oversee critical philanthropic decisions proficiently. In addition, the results would provide valuable insights to decision-makers in philanthropic foundations and other entities, such as practitioners and online fantasy gaming companies, to devise effective marketing strategies to gauge user loyalty and shape donation intentions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Suryavanshi A.K.S.; Thomas S.; Trivedi T.; Patel R.; Bhatt V.,Strategic,10.1002/nvsm.1819,and fantasy sports gaming; flow experience; philanthropic actions; repeat intention to donate; user loyalty; well-being,5.0,,10,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study provides insights into user loyalty and donation intentions towards fantasy sports gaming platforms, focusing on long-term implications for marketing strategies and philanthropic actions.

"One of the substantial challenges in marketing efforts is determining optimal markets, specifically in market segmentation. The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets.

"Purpose: Businesses embark on cause-related marketing (CRM) initiatives as a marketing strategy to fortify consumers' behavioural intentions. Prior research indicates that human values could be tapped to understand the consumers' responses to perceived organizational motives behind undertaking social cause initiatives. This research employs Schwartz's theory of human values to examine consumers' patronage intentions towards CRM-linked fashion products. Moreover, fashion leaders play a crucial role in the diffusion of the latest fashion and fashion trends. This research investigates by integrating human values and fashion leadership, offering insights into CRM-linked fashion consumption motives. Design/methodology/approach: The overarching goal was to investigate the complex interplay between human values and female fashion leadership to predict CRM patronage intention (CPI). Hence, a large-scale research study on 2,050 samples was undertaken by adopting threefold partial least squares–multigroup analysis–artificial neural network (PLS-MGA-ANN) to establish and empirically test a comprehensive model. Findings: This study is unique as it establishes and validates the relative or normalized importance placed on human values by fashion leaders, thereby predicting CPIs. The results revealed that women with high-fashion leadership and specific value types (benevolence, universalism, self-direction) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion retailers. In addition, the findings validated that women with low-fashion leadership and specific value types (tradition, security, conformity) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion stores.

"Learning outcomes: Upon completion of the case study, the students will be able to analyze the brand equity construct through the associative neural network model for decision-making; identify prospective scenarios through the Delphi method for the construction of strategic plans in organizations; and propose the innovation of a product by applying creativity techniques to enter international markets. Case overview/synopsis: Cafe Galavis was one of the leading family businesses in industrial development and had the highest business recognition, with a century of experience in producing and commercializing roasted and ground coffee in Cucuta, Colombia. In 2015, the diplomatic crisis between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela led to the indefinite closure of the Colombian–Venezuelan border, which caused an increase in income from smuggled coffee. In addition, the presence of different competitors and traditional brands negatively impacted the level of sales, which considerably affected financial stability. Likewise, internal difficulties of family nature and administrative management led to the change of senior management. By 2016, Juan Yáñez was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) and was in charge of avoiding the company’s closure. In January 2023, he received feedback from his consulting team, and upon evaluation of the new market challenges with his collaborators, he realized a great challenge that merited the search for a priority alternative solution. How to design a new product considering the loss of brand identity in the face of the generational change of its consumers? These were some of the challenges posed by the CEO that consequently required starting a strategic management process of innovation. Complexity academic level: The teaching case is aimed at students of postgraduate academic programs in the areas of knowledge of innovation, product design, industrial design, marketing or MBA. In the modules of marketing, strategic management, brand management and strategic foresight, the case allowed for the orientation of the concepts of brand value or branding as well as the analysis of the value chain for the implementation of strategies that promote competitive advantages of companies.

"Mall managers tend to believe that purchasing decisions are made inside the shopping malls. These decisions, however, are influenced by various antecedent factors. This implies that shoppers look beyond the basic chore of shopping and experience while shopping plays a vital role. To attract the attention of shoppers, mall developers make huge investments in mall promotion and ambient factors in order to enhance the shopping experience. As the Indian shoppers’ euphoria about shopping malls gets toned down with time, mall managers need to focus on something more substantive. Such fundamental benefits can be offered to shoppers only if mall managers know what is more relevant for the shoppers visiting the malls. Past studies have identified a number of factors such as ambience, physical infrastructure, convenience, safety, and marketing activities. This research posits that a more optimal and focused approach in mall management requires identification of relative significance of various influencing factors. This way, mall managers would be able to offer the most meaningful benefits to shoppers at a very optimal level of investment. Once shoppers get what they value the most, they are expected to be more loyal to the shopping mall. Despite the development of various forecasting techniques, predicting mall loyalty has remained under-explored in marketing literature. This article addresses the gap by using neural network model to predict shoppers’ loyalty towards a particular mall. To gain more insights from the model, the authors have also identified relative significance of the factors impacting shoppers’ mall selection. This study establishes that mall shoppers value ‘convenience’ as the most influencing factor in their selection of malls. This factor alone garners one-third of the total weightage among the five factors, which reflects that significance of convenience is 66 per cent more than what is expected in a scenario when all determinants contribute equally. This strongly indicates that Indian mall shoppers are more utilitarian than hedonic. © 2017, © 2017 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.",Prashar S.; Singh H.; Parsad C.; Vijay T.S.,Strategic,10.1177/0256090917731431,Malls selection; Neural network; Predictive analysis; Retailing; Shopping environment; Shopping experience; Shopping mall,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract focuses on long-term strategies for mall management, emphasizing the importance of understanding shopper preferences and loyalty as critical factors in the overall success of shopping malls.

"In this paper, we propose a principled approach to building and evaluating neural network classification models for decision support system (DSS) implementations. First, the usefulness of neural networks for use with e-commerce data and for Bayesian classification is discussed. Next, the theory concerning model accuracy and generalization is presented. Then, the principled approach, which is developed with consideration of these issues, is described. Through an illustrative problem, it is seen that when problem complexity is considered, the classification performance of the neural networks can be much better than what is observed. Furthermore, it is seen that model order selection processes based upon a single dataset can lead to an incorrect conclusion concerning the best model, which impacts model error and utility. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper investigates the potentialities of the new technology based on neural networks to realize a DSS that might help the marketing and product planning management of a factory in conceiving strategic decisions regarding prices and product performance levels in an oligopolistic market. A possible oligopolistic market scenario assumes a multiplicity of customers whose choices on a given product set have to be explained; the individual choices of these subjects contribute to defining some market shares to be estimated—with their possible evolution—by a multicriteria model (management’s problem formulation). Very few computer based systems to support such a complex problem are found in literature; developed essentially with “classic” methodologies and techniques, they suffer from considering either one single decisional subject (the market/consumer) or a multiplicity of monocriterion choices under uncertainty conditions, without taking into account any integrated representation wich might permit a multiactorial interpretation of “the market” to be given. An approach based on neural networks seems to allow such limits to be overcome, as it has been applied successfully to design and develop a prototype of DSS (MUTANT) for the problem formulated. Some first computational experiments allow some positive judgements to be expressed about the system’s validity and the promising potentialities of a new “modelling and problem solving” approach that might be usefully applied so as to enlarge some potentialities of other multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) methods. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Boscarino M.; Gianoglio P.; Ostanello A.,Strategic,10.1080/12460125.1993.10511571,Explicative models; Multicriteria decisions; Multiple choices; Neural networks,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a decision support system (DSS) based on neural networks to assist in strategic decision-making related to pricing and product performance in an oligopolistic market, which aligns with long-term goals and market strategy.",scopus-neural network,70,20,A Neural Network Design to Support Decision Making with a Complex Multicriteria Problem,1993
"Store branded lookalike packaging resembling national brand product (NB) packaging creates confusion for consumers who are uncertain about their quality preference of the store brand product (SB). This paper presents a model for exploring the NB manufacturer's wholesale price decision, and the response of the SB retailer, considering consumer confusion. Consumers differ in their quality preferences for products and are classified into two groups: deliberate and confused, depending on whether they have precise quality preferences of the SB. We find that when facing a hybrid structure of consumers, the retailer will introduce the SB only when the quality preference difference between high- and low-end consumers is moderate. When the SB is offered, the retailer may not always benefit from targeting low-end consumers with the SB only; a mixed strategy by attracting low-end (high-end) consumers to the national (store) brand product can bring higher profit. Examining the effect of consumer confusion, we find that it may bring a win-win, lose-lose, or win-lose situation for the manufacturer and retailer, depending on the quality preference difference and proportion of high-end consumers. We then consider the case when being deliberate is a choice of the consumer, finding that the retailer will induce consumers to be deliberate only when the store brand quality is low. Consumer confusion will always create a win-win outcome for the manufacturer and retailer when (1) SB quality is higher than NB quality, (2) SB quality is endogenized, or (3) consumers are confused about their quality preference for both the NB and SB. The consumer surplus may be enhanced or weakened, depending on the retailer's market segmentation strategy. Our results reconcile some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical findings regarding the impacts of consumer confusion about the SB derived from lookalike packaging on a two-echelon supply chain, and our insights are robust. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Zha Y.; Guo X.; Chen H.; Ling L.,Strategic,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102841,Competition; Consumer confusion; Store brand; Store branded lookalike packaging; Supply chain management,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of consumer confusion and pricing strategies for national and store brands, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making in marketing.",scopus-prediction,60,25,How does Store Branded Lookalike Packaging Affect Competition in a Dyadic Supply Chain: A Consumer Confusion Perspective,2022
"Purpose: This research article aims to understand the role of brand image, service quality and price (charge) in revitalising functional mass brands into prestigious mass brands. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical research framework was developed by synthesising the past literature on masstige marketing and brand extension. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire from 396 respondents availing M-Wallet. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the brand revitalization attributes; further, the binary logistic regression model examined the effect of revitalization attributes on the chance of increasing customer's perception of masstige. Findings: The exploratory study suggested brand image, service quality and value for money pricing as essential attributes to revitalize mass brands into masstige brands; furthermore, path analysis validated the positive effects of these attributes on the perception of masstige. The proposed binary logistic regression model suggested brand image as sensitive attributes, increasing the odds ratio by 9.39 times in favour of perceiving brand as masstige followed by the perceived service quality that is 5.87 times. The prediction capability of the proposed binary logistic regression model is found to be 96%. Practical implications: The methodology of this study provides the basis for future researchers to advance research on masstige. This study will assist the marketers of mass brands to make better marketing decisions related to how masstige image can be sustained or a new or less known brand can be revitalized into a prestigious brand.

"The purpose of this study was to expand existing knowledge of hotel consumers’ green behaviors by merging value-belief-norm theory and the theory of planned behavior into one theoretical framework to understand comprehensively consumers’ decision-making processes with respect to their intentions to visit a green hotel. Data collected from 757 respondents were analyzed. The results indicate that our integrated framework demonstrates a favorable level of prediction power for guests’ behavior, which verified the superiority of the suggested framework. Furthermore, its findings from fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis indicate that: (a) attitude toward green hotels, perceived behavioral control, sense of obligation, and corporate image are key drivers of guests’ intentions to visit green hotels; (b) three distinct configurations of guests’ intention drivers are likely to result in a high degree of intentions among customers to visit green hotels. The three solutions all contain the conditions of high attitude, corporate image, biospheric value, and green activities, which means that these conditions are vital components of a high intention among customers to visit green hotels.

"This article focuses on the critical importance of demand estimates for effective planning and decision-making in the railway freight transportation industry. Various departments within transportation companies, including marketing, production, distribution, and finance departments, heavily rely on accurate demand forecasts to make informed decisions. Forecasting demand is a crucial aspect of managing business processes, and the methods for doing this can vary across different industries. The ultimate goal remains consistent—to obtain precise predictions of future demand by analyzing historical data and current environmental factors. In the context of transportation services, accurate demand forecasting is essential for successful operational planning and management of functional areas such as transportation operations, marketing, and finance. The current case study specifically examines the National Company Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ), a transport and logistics holding engaged in rail transportation in Kazakhstan. KTZ’s main sources of income are related to freight transportation. The volume of cargo transportation (in tons) and the freight turnover play a significant role in assessing demand and forecasting future revenues from freight traffic. Different techniques for demand forecasting are explored, including qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods rely on judgments and opinions, while quantitative methods utilize historical data or identify causal relationships between variables. Overall, the present study highlights the critical role of demand forecasting in the railway freight transportation industry and its impact on efficient planning and decision-making processes. © 2023 Silesian University of Technology.

"Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between organizational capacity, slack resource, platform strategic choice and firm performance. It also tackles the endogenous issues regarding the strategic choice of platform types. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Heckman’s two-stage procedures to examine the relationship between the variables. The sample in this study comes from Compustat annual company and segment files. The sample used in the main analysis consists of 252 individual corporations globally and 3,528 firm-year observations from 2004–2017. Findings: The empirical results suggest that: (1) firms are more likely to develop physical platforms than virtual platforms when they possess higher levels of available slack, potential slack, research and development (R&D) capacity and marketing capacity; (2) in general, firms developing physical platforms perform better than firms developing virtual platforms after the endogeneity bias are controlled; and (3) firms that choose to develop physical platforms perform better than if they had chosen to develop virtual platforms. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the platform research literature by proposing the endogenous role of platform type choice in firm performance in the context of the retail industry. Prior conceptual and theoretical platform studies have seldom focused on the retail industry through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. This study also presents many opportunities for further explorations on the relationship between firm strategic choice and firm performance in the context of platform retail industry. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that firms must realize that their performance is not necessarily affected by these platform type choice determinants in terms of potential slack, available slack, R&D capacity and marketing capacity. By contrast, they should pay more attention to developing physical platforms if it is possible. The study findings indicate that although virtual platforms have grown rapidly because of the development of technology, firm performance is at all times superior when firms choose to develop physical platforms. Originality/value: Prior platform studies have focused on the topic of network structure, platform architecture, pricing strategy, platform leadership and platform design and governance within the context of video game industry, software industry, hardware industry and telecommunications industry. Seldom of them focus on other industries through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Lee H.; Hsiao Y.-C.; Chen C.-J.; Guo R.-S.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-07-2019-0341,Business strategy; Electronic commerce; Organizational capacity; Physical platform; Retail industry; Slack resource; Strategic management; Virtual platform,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the relationship between organizational capacity, platform strategic choice, and firm performance, which aligns with long-term planning and defining organizational goals.

"Purpose: This study explores the impact of owner chief executive officers' (CEO) narcissism on the exporting small to medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) decision-making on the international market expansion speed after their initial entry. Specifically, the authors use the mechanism of firms' international entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) to examine how owner CEO narcissism may influence SMEs' post-entry speed of internationalization (PSI), both directly and indirectly. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors draw on data from a two-wave questionnaire and on archival export data from 291 Chinese exporting SMEs in three municipalities and 17 provinces from 2019 to 2020. Findings: The results support the theoretical predictions that owner CEO narcissism shapes exporting SMEs' decisions on PSI, both directly and indirectly, through the mediation of firm-level IEO. Originality/value: The study extends emerging research on the role of CEO narcissism in the upper echelons literature into the international marketing (IM) context. It also offers new insights into what drives exporting SMEs' IM decision-making from a psychological microfoundations perspective.

"Marketing practices like money-back guarantees (MBGs) are prevalent in many expert-service markets but are often decried as marketing gimmicks that take advantage of vulnerable and poorly informed consumers. In this research, conducted in the market for in vitro fertilization services, the authors empirically assess differences in quality of care between clinics that offer MBG programs and those that don't, to investigate whether MBG programs can serve a purpose consistent with signaling and insurance theories. The analysis is conducted on a unique longitudinal data set that includes information on clinic-level treatment, outcome statistics, clinic characteristics, and marketing practices for fertility clinics in the United States, state-level insurance mandates, competition environments, and demographic and geographic characteristics. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogeneity of MBG decisions made by fertility clinics, the authors find that MBG clinics, on average, offer better treatment outcomes in terms of success rates while undertaking lower risks. The results are consistent with signaling theory predictions that market-based programs like MBGs can serve as signals of unobservable clinic quality despite the incentives for clinics to engage in opportunistic behaviors. © American Marketing Association 2022.",Yu S.; Ghosh M.; Viswanathan M.,Strategic,10.1177/00222437211060733,expert services; health care marketing; in vitro fertilization; information asymmetry; insurance; money-back guarantees; quality of care; signaling,5.0,,10,5,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The research assesses the long-term implications of marketing practices (money-back guarantees) in the context of in vitro fertilization services, and how these practices can influence clinic quality and consumer trust.

"The behavioral theory of the firm is an important fundamental theory in the management domain. It describes the strategic decision-making process of a firm as a performance feedback process and argues that performance shortfall, i. e., firms′ failing to achieve their aspirations, would make decision makers launch problemistic search to seek solutions to settling the problem of performance shortfall, consequently leading to organizational changes. Previous studies have established theoretical relationship between performance shortfalls and various kinds of organizational changes. However, no consensus has been reached about the effect of performance shortfalls. On one hand, many studies support the classic predictions of the behavioral theory of the firm and it′s found that performance shortfalls would lead to organizational changes of the firm. On the other hand, some studies indicate contrary evidence that performance shortfalls would reduce firms′ tendency to make organizational changes. This study holds that the way a firm responds to performance shortfall depends on decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfall and on the characteristics of that organizational change. To make up for the research gap described above, this study incorporates managerial ability into the behavioral theory of the firm and focuses on the quantity and the quality of firms′ patent applications with inherent tension. Specifically, this study examines how performance shortfall influences firms′ patenting strategies involving the quantity and the quality of patent applications and how managerial ability moderates the relationships between performance shortfall and patenting strategies. This study investigates managerial ability, because it would influence the performance feedback process of the two patenting strategies by altering decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfalls. This study focuses on firms′ patenting strategies for the following reasons. First, patenting strategies are common and important strategies for manufacturing firms to respond to performance shortfalls. Second, there is often a tension between the quantity and the quality of patent applications; therefore, decision makers have to weigh up those two options. Investigating the performance feedback processes of them may reveal the different effects of performance shortfall on organizational changes. This study uses a sample of Chinese A-share manufacturing listed firms in the period of 2011—2017. The data used in this study are from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR) and Wind Database (WIND), which have been widely employed in empirical studies on Chinese firms. To alleviate the potential effect of outliers, this study winsorizes variables with possible outliers at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their distributions. This study employs fixed effect models for panel data to test hypotheses. Fixed effect models can solve the problem that the explanatory variables are correlated with unobserved individual effects. This study uses Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to correct the problems of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation. The measurement of the quantity of patent applications is natural logarithm for the total number of patent applications of a firm. The quality of patent applications is measured as the ratio of the number of invention patent applications to the total number of patent applications. Performance shortfall means performance falls below the aspiration level. This study uses return on assets (ROA) to measure firm performance and focuses on social aspiration. Social aspiration is the average performance of all the other firms in focal firm′s industry. This study uses two-step data envelopment analysis (DEA) to obtain the measurement of managerial ability. As to control variables, this study controls R&D intensity, marketing intensity, unabsorbed slack resources, firm size, income tax ratio, the independence of the board, the size of top management team, ownership concentration, proportion of state-owned shares, positive performance discrepancy, industry dummy variables, and year dummy variables. This study suggests that there is a negative relationship between performance shortfalls and the quantity of patent applications so that the more the performance falls short of the performance aspiration, the smaller the quantity of patent applications would be. In addition, managerial ability would undermine this negative relationship. Moreover, there is a positive relationship between performance shortfalls and the quality of patent applications so that the more the performance falls below the performance aspiration, the higher the quality of patent applications would be, and managerial ability would strengthen this positive relationship. © (2023).

"Many e-commerce platforms provide marketing tools to help their sellers attract customers and enhance user experience. However, there is virtually no theoretical framework or systematic evidence that provides insights to platforms on how their business customers use these marketing tools. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework and apply it to an empirical setting to understand how business customers choose between two service offerings (paid search and hot shop) provided by an e-commerce platform. A unique aspect of our modeling framework is that we incorporate two types of heterogeneous strategic considerations in sellers’ choice decisions of marketing tools: competitor and consumer reactions. To capture seller consideration of competition, we adapt the cognitive hierarchy framework by modeling sellers’ differing abilities to predict how competition affects their decisions. To capture seller consideration of consumer response, we first specify a sales-response model in which sales are affected by the marketing tools used and then incorporate the response parameters in sellers’ payoff functions. Our empirical analysis indicates that these two types of strategic considerations are both important. Our estimation results show that, in making decisions on which marketing tool(s) to use, sellers tend to differentiate themselves from the competition. We also find that sellers with a higher rating tend to be more strategic. This finding provides a useful metric associated with firms’ strategic ability, which is often difficult to quantify, and helps researchers to test theoretical predictions related to firms’ strategic thinking using field data. We perform two comparative statics exercises to derive managerial insights. The first exercise offers a benchmark analysis to help platforms evaluate which targeted promotion strategies are most effective. The second exercise indicates that an increase in seller strategic ability would reduce the overall seller usage of marketing tools, and we offer specific suggestions to help platform managers increase the use of their marketing tools. © 2021 INFORMS.",Yang B.; Yang S.; Dutta S.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2021.1325,behavioral economics; business-to-business marketing; choice modeling; cognitive hierarchy; competition; competitive analysis; electronic commerce; marketing tools; sales response parameters,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a theoretical framework for understanding business customers' choices regarding marketing tools on e-commerce platforms, indicating long-term strategic planning and decision-making.

"Purpose: The authors aim to obtain the optimal combinations of factors from institutional environment adaptation mechanisms and internal resources or capabilities that influence the sustainability of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a new index, called the sustainability index, based on the stakeholder perspective by employing a corporate credit risk index, an evaluation of a firm's corporate governance, corporate financial performance and firm age. The authors then apply both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Analysis and Fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (FsQCA) to obtain the optimal models for firms' sustainability. Findings: The OLS analysis shows that the variables including financial leverage, slack, innovation capability, manufacturing capability and human capital that have significant influences on the sustainability of firms. Our FsQCA analysis obtains configurations of several solutions for firm sustainability and concludes that the fit of combinations of institutional factors and/or internal resources and capabilities of a firm is related to its sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The limitations in our new index include these: first, one may add more key metrics to measure the index; second, the findings do not provide any necessary nor a sufficient condition to get sustainability for sure. The limitations of using multiple regression analysis are that it is not able to reveal the combinations of causal conditions that can lead to the outcome in the real world as well as to the sustainability of a firm in our study. To overcome the limitations, the authors apply fsQCA analysis to identify combinations of causal conditions to a firm's sustainability in our study. Practical implications: Introducing the sustainability index enables us to find out all factors influencing the sustainability of a firm. The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world. Their analysis enables managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. For example, the authors’ fsQCA analysis shows that low marketing capability will lead to the high sustainability of the firm. This information helps managers to make the decision or plan to achieve good results toward their businesses and get better allocate their resources and get a better investment. Social implications: The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world and enable managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. A correct prediction can assist companies in developing their future operations, which would enhance their competitiveness vis-à-vis rivals during this time of global economic volatility, which, in turn, enables firms to perform better and employ more employees that could help the entire society. Originality/value: The sustainability index the authors developed in our paper is new in the literature and the findings obtained by both OLS Regression Analysis and FsQCA are new in predicting a firm's sustainability.

"Increasing numbers of consumers who engage in the development of new products are selling their innovations on online marketplaces. We contribute to the scarce research on the commercialization activities of consumer innovators by comparing the consumers’ price decisions with the pricing of firms. Our predictions build on the baseline assumption that the price decisions of consumers are influenced by the same motivations that originally prompt them to innovate. We use a sequential mixed-method approach with a quantitative main study and follow-up qualitative research. The quantitative results draw on a matched-pair analysis of 4,242 computer games released on the online game platform Steam. We find that consumer innovators charge lower prices than firms for comparable games and that consumers and firms show different inclinations in aligning prices with the games’ development costs and perceived quality. The subsequent interview study with 29 hobbyist game developers provides clear support for the motivational explanations of consumers’ pricing decisions. The findings contribute to research on consumer innovation marketing and nascent entrepreneurship. They also improve the understanding of welfare effects resulting from increasing commercial activities of consumers. © 2020",Ebbing T.; Lüthje C.,Strategic,10.1016/j.respol.2020.104169,Computer games; Consumer innovators; Innovation; Marketplaces; Pricing; User innovation,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on the long-term implications of consumer innovators' pricing decisions compared to firms, which is relevant to strategic planning and understanding market dynamics.",scopus-prediction,60,25,Pricing decisions of consumer innovators,2021
"This research explores how tourist site management and human attitudes and behaviours can help decrease the pressure of tourism on the environment. Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site. Lastly, tourism bodies and businesses could increase their partnerships with local custodians to add cultural value and understand the visitor experience. © 2020 by the authors.

"E-commerce has become an integral part of businesses for decades in the modern world, and this has been exceptionally speeded up during the coronavirus era. To help businesses understand their current and future performance, which can help them survive and thrive in the world of e-commerce, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that conducts performance prediction and evaluation of the e-commerce industry by combining the Grey model, i.e., GM (1, 1) and data envelopment analysis, i.e., the Malmquist-I-C model. For each e-commerce company, GM (1, 1) is applied to predict future values for the period 2020–2022 and Malmquist-I-C is applied to calculate the efficiency score based on output variables such as revenue and gross profit and input variables such as assets, liabilities, and equity. The top 10 e-commerce companies in the US market are used to demonstrate model effectiveness. For the entire research period of 2016–2022, the most productive e-commerce marketplace on average was eBay, followed by Best Buy and Lowe’s; meanwhile, Groupon was the worst-performing e-commerce business during the studied period. Moreover, as most e-commerce companies have progressed in technological development, the results show that the determinants for productivity growth are the technical efficiency change indexes. That means, although focusing on technology development is the key to e-commerce success, companies should make better efforts to maximize their resources such as labor, material and equipment supplies, and capital.

"Customer metrics help firms manage their performance and predict financial outcomes. While many firms focus on customer satisfaction metrics for this purpose, dual-process theories in psychology and neuroscience show that customer decisions are based on two processes. This suggests that metrics which measure the impulsiveness of purchase decisions might effectively complement customer satisfaction metrics. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics make distinct but strong predictions of consumer choices. Satisfaction and impulsiveness influence choice in different ways. While impulsiveness relates to choice directly, the satisfaction-choice path is mediated by loyalty intention. Moreover this relationship is moderated by product involvement such that impulsiveness metrics provide a better prediction for low-involvement than for high-involvement situations. Finally, a field study of 750 customers of 101 firms demonstrates these relationships at a firm level, indicating that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics have equally strong but distinct relationships with shareholder value. Therefore firms may be able to benefit from complementing customer satisfaction metrics with customer impulsiveness metrics. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.",Arens Z.G.; Rust R.T.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-011-0256-3,Customer metrics; Customer satisfaction; Financial impact; Impulsiveness,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses how customer metrics, specifically satisfaction and impulsiveness, can affect financial outcomes and shareholder value, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",scopus-prediction,60,25,The duality of decisions and the case for impulsiveness metrics,2012

"Building behavioral-pricing models-in-contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. The general theory of behavioral strategy includes a set of tenets that describes alternative configurations of decision processes and objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments associating with different outcomes involving specific price-points. This article explicates these tenets and discusses empirical studies which support the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytical tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, ethnographic decision-tree-modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis). The general theory of behavioral pricing involves the blending of cognitive science, complexity theory, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices. Consequently, behavioral pricing theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only price-setting. Capturing and reporting contextually-driven alternative routines to price setting by a compelling set of tenets represent what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory. The general theory serves as a useful foundation for advances in pricing theory and improving pricing practice. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Woodside A.G.,Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.02.004,Behavioral; Configuration; Empiricism; Pricing; Theory,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses a general theory of behavioral pricing that blends multiple disciplines to provide insights into decision processes and objectives, which aligns with long-term strategic goals of pricing theory and practice.",scopus-prediction,60,25,The general theory of behavioral pricing: Applying complexity theory to explicate heterogeneity and achieve high-predictive validity,2015
"Although conceptual research in the accounting literature suggests that the use of performance-measurement systems affects the influence of organizational actors, empirical evidence for this suggestion is largely limited to anecdotal evidence and a few qualitative case studies. Drawing on institutional theory, we develop predictions that link the use of performance measures to the influence of functional subunits in strategic decision making. Our research model tests the effects of two types of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence: (1) decision-facilitating use and (2) use for accountability. Moreover, we propose that the effects of using performance measures for these two purposes depend on the reliability and functional specificity of the measures the functional subunits use. We empirically test our hypotheses and a research question with survey data from 192 marketing directors of German firms. We find that the effect of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence depends on the two properties of the performance measures. We find no significant effects when these properties are not considered. However, decision-facilitating use of performance measures has a positive effect on functional strategic decision influence when the measures are specific to the functional subunit. With respect to the use of performance measures for accountability we find countervailing effects, as the effect on functional strategic decision influence is positive when the measures are more reliable but negative when they are more specific to the functional subunit. We discuss these findings in light of existing evidence and theory. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Artz M.; Homburg C.; Rajab T.,Strategic,10.1016/j.aos.2012.07.001,,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the influence of performance-measurement systems on strategic decision-making within organizations, linking it to long-term goals and overall organizational structure.

"Purpose: Given the growing supply of wines and the large number of new consumers with purchasing power but lacking knowledge of the subtleties of high-quality wines, expert opinions are used for consumers as proxies for quality. This study aims to determine the determinants of prices in top-quality wine market. The authors also seek to estimate the role for country of origin, grape, producing region and winery in prices. And, finally, the authors try to show how countries, regions and wineries can help increase their position in international rankings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors try to answer: What factors explain the price of top-quality wines (defined as best rated in a standardized ranking)? To some extent, in the hands of producers influence prices, which imply long-term decisions or large investments in land and marketing. Other variables that consumer value does affect prices. The authors try also to detect undervalued or overvalued wines, grapes, regions, wineries or producer countries. The authors estimate an econometric model of hedonic prices using a 14-year sample of the Wine Spectator’s 100 top-rated wines for the American market between 2003 and 2016, totaling 1,400 observations. The sample is a great cross-section because each wine is unique. Findings: The authors’ contribution is twofold: the determination of the price explanatory values and the identification and attribution of price differences by country, grape, region and winery. Also, the authors detected grapes, countries, regions and wineries which are overvalued or undervalued with respect to the average prediction of the model. Research limitations/implications: The findings are useful to understand the role of price explanatory variables, as well as for making policy and managerial decisions. From the model, collective or managerial actions can be derived to increase particular wines’ positions in international rankings. The proxy for “quality” in the study is not the only possible definition. Practical implications: In some cases, managerial choices could be conditioned by the policies or history. There is some room for collective action and public policies to improve regions’ and countries’ reputation. Social implications: There are clear synergies for policies that can raise the prestige of countries and regions and their spillovers on the brand name reputation of individual wineries.

Taking the original data of the amount of import and export commodity during the years from 2007 to 2013, the author tries to establish a mathematical model of Grey forecasting to make a prediction of the total value of imports and exports of top commodities in Taiwan for the next 05 coming years from 2014 to 2018. The analysis results show that the usage of Grey forecasting models resulted in a very low mean absolute percentage error, which demonstrate its applicability in practice to provide accurate forecasts. This research also indicates that for the future period of time (2014-2017), there will be a steady increase in both exports and imports value of all top commodities. The current study may offer a good idea for the control and scheduling for the terminal operators in decision making and planning. © 2019, International Journal of Analysis and Applications.

"In the economic field, business development is crucial for the socioeconomic development. On the one hand, the creation of companies can be an effective solution of the unemployment. On the other hand, business development is an essential factor of economic growth. Thus, the development of a country is correlated with its business development. However, business results are not always guaranteed. For this reason, controlling a number of factors related to results is an absolute necessity. Our research aims at studying a set of elements contributing to the results of the success and failure of Turkish companies. For this purpose, we considered a sample of 46 companies, which is subdivided into two sub-samples, the first represents the “Successful companies ""; this category represents 74% of the total sample. The second represents the remaining 26% formed the “Failure companies”. Empirical results highlight the importance of factors related to; the Business plan, the innovation, the marketing strategy, and the human resources. However, ignoring these factors lead to the business failure. Therefore, the prediction of success or failure factors will deliver key information to decision-makers on the mistakes to be avoided and the precautions to be taken. © BEIESP.",Alasaad T.; Gök M.Ş.,Strategic,10.35940/ijrte.B1186.0882S819,Business plan; Failure; Human Research; Innovation; Marketing; Success; Turkish Companies,5.0,,10,0,Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication,"The abstract discusses the factors influencing the success and failure of companies, emphasizing long-term economic development and the importance of strategic elements like business plans, innovation, and marketing strategies.

"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Harmeling C.M.; Palmatier R.W.; Fang E.; Wang D.,Strategic,10.1509/jm.15.0495,Conforming purchase behavior; Dynamic group influence; Group dynamics; Group marketing; Group norms,5.0,,10,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the theoretical foundations of group marketing and its impact on customer behaviors, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",scopus-prediction,60,25,"Group marketing: Theory, mechanisms, and dynamics",2017
"Olive oil is a strategic sector in Spanish agriculture, as a main producer country in the world and as a symbolic product for Spanish society (in terms of economy and culture). However, in the last decade olive oil sector is supporting very low commercial margins and it has important problems of profitability. In a context where retail distribution plays an essential role in final price fixing and, therefore, in the total shared amount by all sector agents, the effectiveness of buy-and-sale strategies along the chain influences the commercial results of the different agents. In particular, the main income of olive oil producers comes from oil marketing in the market of origin, which integrates the maximum percentage of dealings (80%). The commercial operations in this market are the references for price negotiations in other levels of the agri-food chain, for example, with distributors. In this scene, Andalusia has a predominant role because it concentrates the Spanish production of olive oils (72,40%). So, the trading operations in this area determine, in part, the national price level and they have a high influence in worldwide prices. Due to its position as a supplier row material, the market of origin is playing a key role in the incomes of all the agents in the chain. For this reason, the study of price formation, its dynamic and the variables that can influence in this process, is needed in order to know the price evolution and therefore, to decide the best moment to buy and sell. In this sense, from our point of view, in the literature is possible to underline two main characteristics that could influence in price's evolution. (1) The prices of different quality levels are very similar Price's differences are small and this fact contrasts with the public strategy to improve the quality of Spanish olive oil production (quality programmes from national and regional government and the European Union). And (2), in the last decade, these differences between qualities are constant and with a similar evolution. So, it could be possible to predict price's evolution only with the price of a quality and adding some cents in order to know the price of the rest. Based on the social context and the development of databases in the market of origin in Andalusia, the objective of this paper is to analyse the casual relationship between the prices of three qualities that are sold in origin: extra virgin, virgin and lampante. The methodology used to study the price evolution and its relationships is based on the cointegration theory, the Error Correction Model and it is completed with the study of short-run relationships through Granger's causality, variance decomposition of forecast errors and impulse response functions. Analysis includes 106 monthly data of each price series for the most instability period in the market of origin (since January'01 to October'09). This information was provided by the Foundation for the Promotion and Development of the Olive Grove and Oil, based on the POOLred System of origin prices. This system collects the features of bulk olive oil transactions of a sample of Andalusian olive oil mills that represents 55.30% of Spanish olive oil production. It is currently the main price reference in this sector. Results show that, in long term, origin is a strong integrated market and it is in equilibrium because the prices of three qualities move together during all the period. However, in short term it is possible to highlight the virgin olive oil as a leader in the market. It is the quality more independent and with more influence over the rest. So, price movements of virgin quality could predict the evolution of the other price's qualities. These outcomes are coherent with the role of virgin quality in the market of origin. Virgin olive oil is the quality with more number of commercial operations in the market. This volume is a consequence of its versatility, because can be used as direct consumption product, to mix with other olive oils or to refine. On the one hand, the direct consumption of virgin quality, similar to the virgin extra olive oil could be an influence in the price of the last one, adopting a role of direct competitor. In this sense, the use of extra virgin as a bait product for distributors reduces the differences between both prices and increase the competency. Furthermore, the consumer's confusion between different qualities of olive oils favours this situation. On the other hand, because a part of virgin's production is used to refne in order to produce olive oil, its prices could be a reference for the price of lampante. At the same time, the strategy of quality implemented by public administration is increasing the volume of virgin and extra virgin olive oils produced in Andalusia and, therefore, the numbers of commercial operations with these qualities in the market of origin. So, when quality production exceeds consumption, a part of these olive oils is destined to elaborate low quality olive oil and it increases price competition. In sum, the large number of operations and its versatility transform the virgin olive oil into the quality more important in the market of origin, from the point of view of price influences. This conclusion is useful to develop managerial strategies, specifically in the forecasting of price behaviour in the market. Because the prediction of price evolution in origin market is affected by several subjective aspects (crop level or weather prevision, for example), the use of an objective predict variable, as a virgin olive oil price, could improve the results of the models. Particularly, these results affect to the study of prices in order to request to government the intervention of the market through private storage system (Spanish Ministry of Agricultural and European Union). Furthermore, in general these results are useful for the development of agri-food policies by sector institutions, which analyse the prices in the market of origin in order to make decision about funding and grant. Finally, this paper could be a starting point to analyse causal relationship between different olive oils in the two main market of the agri-food chain (origin and final market), with the objective to know what variables have to be included in price's forecast models.",Gutiérrez-Salcedo M.; Murgado-Armenteros E.M.; Ruiz F.J.T.,Strategic,,Causality; ECM; Olive oils; Price; Quality,5.0,,5,0,Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia,"The abstract discusses the pricing dynamics and market behavior of olive oil, which are crucial for long-term strategies in agricultural pricing and market positioning.

"The term 'viral' is used to describe a phenomenon that tends to be shared by those who encounter it. This paper considers the act of responding positively to a phenomenon by sharing it with others, something exemplified by the online social media acts of choosing to 'like' on Facebook, 'retweet' on Twitter, or by a similar mechanism on websites such as LinkedIn, Flickr or Pinterest. Using a threshold model of influence, simulations are run on four network structures where a critical mass chooses to share a phenomenon that eventually either goes viral or does not. The data collected are examined to determine whether an individual node can make an accurate prediction about the state of the entire network just from information on the behavior of their neighbors. The intention is to study what it is in terms of network structure that makes an individual good at sensing the zeitgeist, or 'spirit of the age'. Findings show that those best placed to predict are 'important' as measured by network centrality, and members of numerous communities. The characteristics of the critical mass are important in determining the spread of a phenomenon and it is possible for an individual node to predict an outcome as well as an observer who has access to the state of every node in the network. Potential applications might be found in monitoring the success of marketing campaigns, or in organizations wishing to keep abreast of current trends in a situation where data on network structure is available but data on the activity of network members is limited. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Chesney T.,Strategic,10.1016/j.dss.2013.07.006,Consensus decision; Simulation; Social network; Viral marketing,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the prediction of viral phenomena within social networks, which relates to long-term strategic planning in marketing and organizational behavior.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explain that theories provide an important tool for practitioners in guiding decisions by explaining and predicting consumer decision making when new specific research data might be unavailable. This is true despite the problems caused by some academic journal articles’ use and abuse of theory development. The argument for this crucial role of theory in marketing practice explains reasons why many practitioners dislike academic research and related theory development, as well as points out where practitioners’ criticisms are valid. Design/methodology/approach – Delineation of problems in journal articles and some research notes the overall value of work for marketing practice and (indirectly) points out the important value of practitioner-focused research publications. Findings – While marketing practitioners are wrong to condemn all theory development as useless, too often in too many ways, researchers and journals deserve it.

"The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%–6% in transactions’ prices. Our results lend ample support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic behavior. © 2016 INFORMS.",Mantin B.; Rubin E.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2015.0965,Airline industry; Decision support; Information availability; Revenue management; Strategic consumers,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the impact of online decision support tools on consumer behavior and pricing strategies within the airline industry, indicating a focus on long-term strategic implications for pricing decisions and competition.",scopus-prediction,60,25,Fare prediction websites and transaction prices: Empirical evidence from the airline industry,2016
"This paper examines to what extent, if any, natural environmental factors affect consumer purchase decisions regarding “green” products. We collect and combine several unique datasets to study the impact of air pollution on consumers’ choices of passenger vehicles in China. Exploiting cross-city variation, we find that air pollution levels negatively affect the sales of fuel-inefficient cars on average. This relationship, though, is U-shaped over the observed air pollution levels, in that fuel-inefficient car purchases rise with air pollution beyond some threshold. Furthermore, a city’s income level is a significant factor in this non-monotonic relationship, in the sense that consumers of higher-income cities are less likely to suffer this reversal.

"Given the dynamic business environment of today, companies need accurate and timely information in order to make the best decisions for the company and to respond promptly to any market changes, competitors and customers needs. The emergence and development of the Internet has changed the business model. Now, the notion of quantity and quality as the only references for the growth and development of a business, have been replaced with the visibility of the company and its products on the market.

"This study examines the effects of a relatively new channel structure on prices and sales in a large department store, which in recent years has switched the management of many of its product categories from a traditional retailer-managed system to a manufacturer-managed system. We find that the change caused overall retail prices to decrease. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the response across brands. In the cell phone category, brands with high market shares and inelastic demand did not change prices. In the watch category, the retail prices of relatively low-end brands decreased while the prices of premium brands increased substantially after the switch. In addition to sales increases due to lower prices, we find that the channel structure change further caused sales to increase by 9–10% in the cell phone category and by 11–17% in the watch category. These results are consistent with previous theoretical predictions.

"The proliferation of the Internet has enabled platform intermediaries to create two-sided markets in many industries. Time-series data on the number of customers on both sides of the markets allow platform intermediaries for estimating the direction and magnitude of network effects, which can then support growth predictions and subsequent information technology (IT) or marketing investment decisions. This article investigates the conditions under which this estimation of same-side and cross-side network effects should distinguish between its impact on the number of new customers (i.e., acquisition) and existing customers (i.e., their activity). The authors propose an influx-outflow model for doing so and conduct a simulation study to benchmark the new model against the traditional model. Further they compare the models in an illustrative empirical study in which they study the growth of an Internet auction platform. The results show that this separation of effects is beneficial because the existing customers on both sides of the market can influence the acquisition and dropout of other customers asymmetrically.

"The development of industrial marketing theory has been largely characterized by descriptive approaches in the scrutiny of B2B marketing phenomena. In its pursuit for scientific legitimacy and credibility to academics and practitioners alike, research into B2B relationships as a subject of scientific enquiry will need to seriously engage into what can be termed a true paradigm shift, one that advances discovery in this area from sheer descriptive analysis and reporting to the development of explanatory schemata and theoretical frameworks of a kind that allow for more accurate prediction of underlying B2B phenomena. In doing so, theoreticians and practitioners alike will be better equipped to understand both current and emerging issues at hand as well as their implications to organizations across any geography, cultural context, or business situation.

"In marketing and finance, surprisingly simple models sometimes predict more accurately than more complex, sophisticated models. Here, we address the question of when and why simple models succeed - or fail - by framing the forecasting problem in terms of the bias-variance dilemma. Controllable error in forecasting consists of two components, the ""bias"" and the ""variance"". We argue that the benefits of simplicity are often overlooked because of a pervasive ""bias bias"": the importance of the bias component of prediction error is inflated, and the variance component of prediction error, which reflects an oversensitivity of a model to different samples from the same population, is neglected. Using the study of cognitive heuristics, we discuss how to reduce variance by ignoring weights, attributes, and dependencies between attributes, and thus make better decisions. Bias and variance, we argue, offer a more insightful perspective on the benefits of simplicity than Occam''s razor. © 2015 .",Brighton H.; Gigerenzer G.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.01.061,Bias bias; Bias-variance dilemma; Occam's razor; Out-of-sample prediction; Simple heuristics; Uncertainty,5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the bias-variance dilemma in forecasting and the benefits of simplicity in predictive models, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and decision-making in marketing and finance.",scopus-prediction,60,20,The bias bias,2015

"Purpose: Given the high uncertainty in the quality perception of experiential products, manufacturers use signals to influence consumers’ decisions. In the movie industry, literature shows that performance of the main channel (e.g. cinema) strongly influences the performance of auxiliary channels (e.g. DVDs). The success of a movie in the home country is also to be resonated by its good performance in host countries. However, the cultural contingency of these success-breeds-success (SBS) effects has not been examined. This paper aims to test the influence of cultural values on the SBS effects across channels and countries. Design/methodology/approach: Borrowing concepts from the signaling literature and analyzing DVD sales data from six international markets using a multilevel mixed-effects model, the study finds that culture plays a significant role to influence both SBS effects. Findings: In countries with low power distance, short-term orientation and high indulgence, consumers who purchase from auxiliary channels are more likely to be influenced by the box office performance of movies. Meanwhile, cultural distance between the home and host nations significantly decreases the cross-national SBS effect. Research limitations/implications: The findings are likely to be generalized to online auxiliary channels of movies, but empirical testing is required to ensure that no major adaptation is required in the process. Future research can also extend the framework of this paper to include more countries into the analysis and investigate cultural variables beyond Hofstede’s dimensions. Practical implications: This paper suggests that the SBS effects may vary across nations. When managers plan for the sequential distributions of experiential products, the cultural values of target markets should be considered to decrease the uncertainty in sales prediction. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the international auxiliary channels of movies and incorporating cultural values into the framework of sequential distributions.

"The general theory of behavioral strategies includes a set of propositions supporting alternative configurations of objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments by executives. The theory includes the outcomes of selections of specific decision alternatives. Building behavioral-strategy models in contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. This chapter is a primer to the general theory. A brief review of relevant empirical studies supports the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytically tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, statistical hypothesis testing, ethnographic decision tree modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., qualitative comparative analysis, QCA). The general theory is the blending of cognitive science, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices in explicit contexts. Consequently, behavioral-strategy theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only decision-making. Capturing and reporting contextually driven alternative routines to strategy setting by a compelling set of propositions represents what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory. The general theory serves as a useful foundation for advances theory and improving the practice of implemented strategies.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature about the use of agent-based simulation (ABS) in the study of organizational behavior, decision making, and problem-solving. It aims at contributing to the consolidation of ABS as a field of applied research in management and organizational studies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out a non-systematic search in literature published between 2000 and 2016, by using the keyword “agent-based” to search through Scopus’ business, management and accounting database. Additional search criteria were devised using the papers’ keywords and the categories defined by the divisions and interest groups of the Academy of Management. The authors found 181 articles for this survey. Findings: The survey shows that ABS provides a robust and rigorous framework to elaborate descriptions, explanations, predictions and theories about organizations and their processes as well as develop tools that support strategic and operational decision making and problem-solving.

"Mixed strategies are widely used to model strategic situations in diverse fields such as economics, marketing, political science, and biology. However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects. We find that the EWA learning model tracks the investment decisions of our subjects well, whether we hold out trials or an entire group of subjects.",Amaldoss W.; Jain S.,Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.48.8.972.165,Competitive strategy; Decision analysis; Experimental economics; Learning; Marketing; R & D,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a model of competitive behavior in a patent race, which involves long-term strategic decision-making by firms regarding their investment in product development and patent acquisition.

"The emphasis on consumer decision models implies that purchases largely result from a deliberate conscious search. In truth, purchases of even the new are largely unconcious automatic responses (habits, perceptions, attitudes, roles, ect.). The difficulty the customer experiences in changing such automatic response patterns is the key to understanding the widely disparate rates of adoption and diffusion of successful new products. Forecasting the timing and speed of market growth is crucial for the introducer. A mistake in either direction is serious and may be disastrous. Fortunately, prediction of the expected speed of acceptance is possible once the role of these responses is understood. *** DIRECT SUPPORT *** A00BV020 00006 © 1980 Academy of Marketing Science.",Wasson C.R.,Strategic,10.1007/BF02729685,,10.0,,10,0,Springer-Verlag,"The abstract discusses the importance of understanding consumer behavior and automatic responses in the context of product adoption and market growth forecasting, aligning with long-term strategic planning and decision-making.",scopus-prediction,60,20,"Consumer choice processes: Search, or automatic response?",1979
"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the prediction of competitive response based on the characteristics of market and non-market actions comprehensively, and develop a four-stage decision-making model of firm's competitive action, which is significant for Chinese practicing managers when formulating and implementing the strategies, and further predicting competitors' strategic choices. Design/methodology/approachThe research adopted the method of structured content analysis and carried out the survey in Chinese home appliance industry, mainly covering the largest firms, including TCL, Hisense, Changhong, Konka, Haier, and Skyworth. The method of multiple regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. FindingsThe results show that in order to comprehensively forecast competitor's responding behaviors, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market. Additionally, in the process of dynamic interaction, the attacking or responding action is not independent and it is related significantly to another three type decisions, which are market and non-market, strategic and tactic, and collective and individual. Further, the study asserts that, in market field, tactic activity is more likely to trigger competitor's response than strategic one, while in non-market, the situation is just the opposite. Meanwhile, the study figured out that individual market attack is easier to trigger individual market and non-market response, as well as collective market response. While for non-market action, whatever it is individual or collective, both would be easy to provoke competitor's collective response. Originality/valueThe research findings extend the existing competitive interaction theory to non-market field. When forecasting competitor's choice of the competitive action, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market, attaching importance to certain situation of competitor's taking such non-market action as corporate philanthropy, etc. to launch an attack or a response for gaining competitive advantage. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Deng X.; Tian Z.; Fan S.; Abrar M.,Strategic,10.1108/20408741011082570,China; Competitive advantage; Marketing strategy,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the development of a four-stage decision-making model for predicting competitive response, which focuses on long-term strategic planning and understanding competitors' strategic choices in both market and non-market contexts.

"Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition between independent information sellers can result in prices that are negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers. © 2007, American Marketing Association.",Christen M.; Sarvary M.,Strategic,10.1509/jmkr.44.1.42,,5.0,,10,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses theoretical work on pricing strategies that impact long-term market behaviors and decisions regarding information quality, which aligns with strategic decision-making in marketing.",scopus-prediction,60,25,Competitive pricing of information: A longitudinal experiment,2007
"Both the size and the rapid growth of global exporting have focused the attention of marketing researchers on the factors associated with firms' export performance. However, knowledge of this increasingly important domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities, competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to structure-conduct-performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance. However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages realized.",Morgan N.A.; Kaleka A.; Katsikeas C.S.,Strategic,10.1509/jmkg.68.1.90.24028,,5.0,,10,5,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the development of an integrative theory of export venture performance, focusing on long-term factors such as available resources, capabilities, and competitive strategies, which align with strategic planning.",scopus-prediction,60,20,Antecedents of Export Venture Performance: A Theoretical Model and Empirical Assessment,2004
"Purpose - The frequency and sophistication of consumer boycotts continue to increase from already high levels. Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study 1 show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Ettenson R.; Klein J.G.,Strategic,10.1108/02651330510593278,Brands; Consumer behaviour; International business,10.0,,10,0,,"The paper provides a strategic analysis of consumer boycotts and suggests implications for managerial decisions, indicating a focus on long-term goals and organizational strategy.",scopus-prediction,60,20,The fallout from French nuclear testing in the South Pacific: A longitudinal study of consumer boycotts,2005
"Most supermarket firms choose to position themselves by offering either everyday low prices (EDLP) across several items or offering temporary price reductions (promotions) on a limited range of items. While this choice has been addressed from a theoretical perspective in both the marketing and economic literature, relatively little is known about how these decisions are made in practice, especially within a competitive environment. This paper exploits a unique store level data set consisting of every supermarket operating in the United States in 1998. For each of these stores, we observe the pricing strategy the firm has chosen to follow, as reported by the firm itself. Using a system of simultaneous discrete choice models, we estimate each store's choice of pricing strategy as a static discrete game of incomplete information. In contrast to the predictions of the theoretical literature, we find strong evidence that firms cluster by strategy by choosing actions that agree with those of its rivals. We also find a significant impact of various demographic and store/chain characteristics, providing some qualified support for several specific predictions from marketing theory. © 2008 INFORMS.",Ellickson P.B.; Misra S.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1080.0398,Discrete games; EDLP; Positioning strategies; Promotional pricing; Supermarkets,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the strategic positioning of supermarket firms with respect to pricing strategies, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and market behavior.

"Few are the efforts in Brazil directed towards the investigation of the relationship between consumers’ behaviors, values, and social beliefs (i.e, axioms), although there is evidence that in the country, consumer values also explain part of the consumption decision process, enhancing the cultural validity of the Two Route Model (TRM). This study’s objective was to evaluate the influence of cultural aspects in the buying decision, going beyond the TRM, and proposing the Consumer Cultural Influence Model (CCIM), which analyses the consumer choice based not only on values, but also on the social axioms construct, as proposed by Leung et al. (2002). To test the CCIM, the Brazilian higher education market was chose as study object. Participated in the study 2,483 students from the entire country, with an average age of 22.6 years old (SD = 6.9) and 59.2% of them female. They completed an importance of tangible attributes measure, the Schwartz Values Scale (SCHWARTZ, 1994), the Social Axioms Scale, the Services Meaning and Judgment Scale, and demographics questions. After checking whether the assumptions were met, and Factor Analyses procedures, binary logistic regressions, among direct and sequential, were accomplished using only values, only axioms, and finally, values and axioms as criteria variables. In general, results show the stability of the CCIM, its superiority towards the TRM, with an increase in prediction of up to 89.5%. Whilst values are transituational and prescriptive, axioms are descriptive, accomplishing instrumental functions of attitudes related to objects description. Cognitively, the description of a social object is more available to the person than its prediction, due to the proximity of the attributes to the object, allowing a better explanation of the consumer behavior. Results have implications to a more effective marketing positioning, as the survival in the market also depends on subjective aspects, such as those included in the CCIM. © 2012 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.
