"Herbicides are used worldwide to protect agricultural crops, glyphosate being among the most frequently applied. In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient—AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup® Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from ~20% to ~50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released ~70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use. © 2023 by the authors.",Venâncio C.; Barbosa C.; Lopes I.,Out of scope,10.3390/su151612428,environmentally relevant; green hydra; herbicide; life cycle parameters; plant protection products,0.0,,0,100,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses the ecological and toxicological effects of glyphosate and its commercial formulations on living organisms, which falls outside the realm of marketing and strategic business decisions.",scopus-ai,0,0,Glyphosate and Roundup® Ready Effects in Hydra viridissima: New Data in an Old Issue,2023
"Background: In an effort to improve the quality of medical care, the philosophy of patient-centered care has become integrated into almost every aspect of the medical community. Despite its widespread acceptance, among patients and practitioners, there are concerns that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence may threaten elements of patient-centered care, such as personal relationships with care providers and patient-driven choices. This study explores the extent to which patients are confident in and comfortable with the use of these technologies when it comes to their own individual care and identifies areas that may align with or threaten elements of patient-centered care. Methods: An exploratory, mixed-method approach was used to analyze survey data from 600 US-based adults in the State of Florida. The survey was administered through a leading market research provider (August 10–21, 2023), and responses were collected to be representative of the state’s population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Results: Respondents were more comfortable with the use of AI in health-related tasks that were not associated with doctor-patient relationships, such as scheduling patient appointments or follow-ups (84.2%). Fear of losing the ‘human touch’ associated with doctors was a common theme within qualitative coding, suggesting a potential conflict between the implementation of AI and patient-centered care. In addition, decision self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of comfort with AI, but there were also concerns about losing decision-making control, workforce changes, and cost concerns. A small majority of participants mentioned that AI could be useful for doctors and lead to more equitable care but only when used within limits. Conclusion: The application of AI in medical care is rapidly advancing, but oversight, regulation, and guidance addressing critical aspects of patient-centered care are lacking. While there is no evidence that AI will undermine patient-physician relationships at this time, there is concern on the part of patients regarding the application of AI within medical care and specifically as it relates to their interaction with physicians. Medical guidance on incorporating AI while adhering to the principles of patient-centered care is needed to clarify how AI will augment medical care. © The Author(s) 2024.",Witkowski K.; Okhai R.; Neely S.R.,Out of scope,10.1186/s12910-024-01066-4,Artificial intelligence; Patient-centered care; Patient-physician relationship; Public perception,,0.0,0,100,BioMed Central Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implications of AI in medical care, which falls under healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-ai,0,0,Public perceptions of artificial intelligence in healthcare: ethical concerns and opportunities for patient-centered care,2024
"Purpose: This research examines whether anthropomorphizing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots alters consumers' risk preferences toward financial investment options involving differential risks. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3). Originality/value: Anthropomorphizing AI has undeniable relevance in the contemporary marketing landscape, such as humanoid robotics and emotion AI algorithms. Despite of anthropomorphism's significance and relevance, the downstream impact of anthropomorphism remains unfortunately underexplored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cui Y.,Out of scope,10.1108/IJBM-09-2021-0451,Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence (AI); Political ideology; Psychological closeness; Psychological risk attachment; Risk aversion,0.0,,0,100,Emerald Publishing,"The research focuses on financial investment options and risk preferences, which are related to financial services rather than marketing.",scopus-ai,0,0,"Sophia Sophia tell me more, which is the most risk-free plan of all?

"Purpose: Digital transformations are altering service models and care delivery methods in healthcare. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next wave of transformation in healthcare. This study aims to understand patient perceptions of AI and its impact on value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed to investigate how value co-creation operant resources (digital self-efficacy and relational service quality) impact value co-creation engagement (shared decision-making) and value co-creation outcomes (anticipatory AI value co-creation and intention to adopt AI). Data were collected from 332 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that the value co-creation process for AI technologies is a function of inputs, experiences and AI outputs. Operant resources were found to be positively associated with shared decision-making. However, not all operant resources directly and positively impacted AI outcomes. The indirect and positive mediated relationships through shared decision-making to AI outcomes suggest an interactive AI value co-creation process. Research limitations/implications: AI technologies are still in early stages of consumer adoption in healthcare. Future research is warranted that investigates the validity of the model through maturing service life cycles. Practical implications: Customer perceptions of new digital innovations are formed in the context of previous digital experiences. Marketers need to understand how customers view their current non-AI technologies. Strong engagement and perceived value of current technologies will help ease customers into the usage of AI technologies. Originality/value: This study investigates the unique stages of the value co-creation process for AI technologies in healthcare. The results demonstrate that the value co-creation process is a function of inputs, tech-enabled experiences and AI outputs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Swan E.L.; Peltier J.W.; Dahl A.J.,Out of scope,10.1108/JRIM-09-2022-0293,Artificial intelligence; Digital transformation; Healthcare; Service-dominant logic; Services marketing,,0.0,0,100,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the impact of AI in healthcare, which is not related to marketing applications.

"This paper introduces an IT artifact called MoFiN DSS that comprises hard- and software components that provide the basis for a prototype of a financial decision support system (DSS) to support individual investors reacting to unforeseen market events. We have derived our motivation for building such a system design from behavioral finance research. Analyses of the behavior of individual investors provide evidence that this segment does react more significantly to any public news published compared to institutional investors. On the other hand, the analyses show that they react significantly slower than their institutional counterparts. Since empirical intraday event study analyses show that capital markets react promptly to new information and that excess returns decrease over a specific period of time, individual investors miss significant trading opportunities due to their current strategies of information research. We address the problem that this market segment is not able to continuously observe diverse information channels and to assess all the new information available. Our prototype decision support system continuously observes company announcements and forecasts their potential impact on the corresponding stock price. After identifying those events for which significant market reactions can be expected, wireless push-based message services provide the technical basis for prompt and location-independent information supply. Based on a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology we have developed, we demonstrate and quantify the advantages that the developed system provides to the individual investors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Assembling financial instruments such as equities, bonds, options, and other derivatives into a portfolio requires a thorough understanding of how the portfolio will behave in response to changes of specific economic variables and parameters of the instruments. With more information about a more diverse set of instruments becoming available to traders, it is becoming important to limit the complexity of the analysis involved. We show how this complexity can be limited by using qualitative analysis, where the objective is to construct a few good vehicles which can then be analyzed quantitatively. We illustrate how two qualitative reasoning techniques - qualitative simulation and qualitative synthesis - are used to design investment vehicles for risk management purposes. These techniques are currently employed by a prototype expert system that aims at assisting traders solving a risk management problem called hedging. © 1995.",Benaroch M.; Dhar V.,Out of scope,10.1016/0167-9236(94)00031-M,(QR); (QSIM); (QSYN); Financial instruments; Financial risk management; Investment decisions; Payoff-profile; Qualitative reasoning; Qualitative reasoning techniques; Qualitative simulation; Qualitative synthesis; Risk management vehicle; Vehicle configuration,0.0,,0,100,,"The abstract discusses financial instruments and risk management, which fall outside the realm of marketing applications.",scopus-artificial intelligence,0,0,Controlling the complexity of investment decisions using qualitative reasoning techniques,1995
"The use of machine learning (ML) in medicine is becoming increasingly fundamental to analyse complex problems by discovering associations among different types of information and to generate knowledge for medical decision support. Many regulatory and ethical issues should be considered. Some relevant EU provisions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, are applicable. However, the regulatory framework for developing and marketing a new health technology implementing ML may be quite complex. Other issues include the legal liability and the attribution of negligence in case of errors. Some of the above-mentioned concerns could be, at least partially, resolved in case the ML software is classified as a 'medical device', a category covered by EU/national provisions. Concluding, the challenge is to understand how sustainable is the regulatory system in relation to the ML innovation and how legal procedures should be revised in order to adapt them to the current regulatory framework. © 2020 Copyright 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",Bonifazi F.; Volpe E.; Digregorio G.; Giannuzzi V.; Ceci A.,Out of scope,10.1163/15718093-BJA10009,artificial intelligence; ethical issues; health data; machine learning (ML); regulatory issues,5.0,,5,75,Brill Nijhoff,"The abstract discusses the regulatory and ethical issues surrounding the use of machine learning in medicine, which falls outside the marketing context and pertains to healthcare technology.",scopus-artificial intelligence,10,5,Machine Learning Systems Applied to Health Data and System,2020

"A simulation model is developed for Vietnam to project smoking prevalence and associated premature mortality. The model examines independently and as a package the effects of five types of tobacco control policies: tax increases, clean air laws, mass media campaigns, advertising bans, and youth access policies. Predictions suggest that the largest reductions in smoking rates will result from implementing a comprehensive tobacco control policy package. Significant inroads may be achieved through tax increases. A media campaign along with programs to publicize and enforce clean air laws, advertising bans and youth access laws would further reduce smoking rates. Tobacco control policies have the potential to make large dents in smoking rates, which in turn could lead to many lives saved. In the absence of these measures, deaths from smoking will increase. The model also helps to identify information gaps pertinent both to modeling and policymaking. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Aims: In the literature, it is still unclear if the decisions for selecting the type of implant crown-retaining system are based on scientific-based research or if the Universities’ choices, Implant marketing trends, or finances could have a major influence on the private dentists’ decisions. Objectives: Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the crown-retaining system (cement- or screw-retained) used in dental schools and private dental practices. Methods: A 13-item questionnaire was sent to Canadian dental schools (n = 10) and dental offices in London (n = 298), Canada. The questionnaire included demographic questions and questions to reveal the dentists’ perspectives on prosthetic implant treatment between the two-retaining systems. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression (p = 0.05). Results: Twenty-four private dentists and five dental schools responded to the survey – 62.5% of private practitioners and 60% of universities reported using both systems. A trend was observed in using screw-retained systems by dentists who graduated 5–10 years ago. Straumann, Astra, and Nobel Biocare were the private practices and dental schools’ preferred implant systems. The use of platform switching for all cases was selected by 54.2% of the private practitioners and 40% of the dental schools. Resin cement was the private practice's preferred cementation method; the dental schools used glass ionomer and zinc phosphate cement. The multinomial logistic regressions showed no statistical difference between the crown-retaining system chosen and the decision factors. The laboratory technician's recommendations and cost influenced the decision-making process for private dentists. For the universities, perio-restorative outcome, implant position, survival rates, institute preferences, and evidence-based research influenced the crown-retaining system's decision-making process. Conclusion: The Canadian dental schools and private practice reported using both screw- and cement-retaining systems. However, there was a difference in the selection criteria as the universities showed a tendency towards a more research-based approach in their decision, while for the private practices, the technicians’ recommendations and cost played a major role in the decision process. It was noted that the implant systems preconized by the Universities were observed to be used in private practices. © 2024 The Authors.

"Background: Active transport has numerous environmental and health benefits. However, these benefits are not evenly distributed across the population because its utilization is strongly linked to a person's socioeconomic and cultural factors. Through the lens of intersectionality, this systematic review analyzed how gender and its interactions with other socioeconomic and cultural factors influence a person's decision to utilize active transport in urban settings. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the authors screened 1,993 titles and abstracts that were published between January 2000 and December 2021. Twenty-one articles were included for data extraction and synthesis. Results: A person's decision to walk or cycle is highly contextual. In general, women with lower socioeconomic status tend to walk more out of necessity. Women with higher socioeconomic status, higher education level, more free time, and access to safe and convenient infrastructure tend to cycle more. Gendered social and cultural factors might also deter some women from active transport. The following recommendations may attract more people to walk or cycle for transportation: developing community-based programs that empower girls and women to cycle; building a safe environment that protects all vulnerable road users; creating media and social marketing campaigns that shift the cultural narratives around active transport; designing neighourhoods with higher mixed land usage; and advocating for gender and income equality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Yuan Y.; Masud M.; Chan H.; Chan W.; Brubacher J.R.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.jth.2023.101572,Active transportation; Gender; Intersectionality; Socioeconomic status,0.0,,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the impact of socioeconomic and cultural factors on active transport, specifically in relation to gender.

"This study revealed two different sets of push and pull factors affecting the medical travel decision process of two groups of mainland Chinese to Hong Kong, including potential and experienced medical tourists. The relations between identified factors and their willingness of personal visit and recommendation were also investigated. Regarding the recommendation intention, interpersonal acquisition and personal needs satisfaction are mostly considered by travelers in psychological level while recognized high medical reception capacity and quality are also prioritized in the pull aspect. However, local medical service constraints, perceived quality of medical experience shaped by healthcare suppliers, and destination attributes determine the two groups' responses to personal visit intention. Besides, the advantages of developing medical tourism in Hong Kong are implicated as can-be-perceived unique cultural attribute, mass tourism fame as medical tourism development basis, and reputation for high-quality care formed with unintentional or deliberate promotion from third parties and various marketing channels. © 2024 The Authors.

"The purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, the paper calls attention to a unique subset of professional service providers (PSPs) who have obvious product expertise related to their profession yet are only minimally involved in the sales process. Despite this, they are considerably influential in regard to their clients’ brand decision-making process. Examples of these include veterinarians recommending a given pet food brand and dentists recommending a brand of dental floss. Secondly, since environmental sustainability is an important facet of corporate social responsibility, we considered factors that help predict PSPs’ propensity to recommend environmentally friendly brands to their clientele.The conceptual model argues that PSPs’ degree of identification with their profession, self-assessed knowledge in environmental concerns and expectation that sustainable brands will engage in eco-based marketing are all positive influences on PSPs’ likelihood to recommend sustainable brands and generate positive word of mouth. Responses from 467 veterinarians, representing this unique class of PSPs were analysed, and structural equation modelling determined that identification with the profession was a motivating factor in learning more about sustainability. In turn, self-assessed expertise in environmental issues was shown to increase the likelihood that PSPs would recommend sustainable brands. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.",Stoica M.; Hickman T.M.,Out of scope,,brand recommendation; corporate social responsibility; professional service provider; social identity theory; sustainability; word of mouth,0.0,,5,85,Henry Stewart Publications,"The abstract primarily discusses professional service providers (PSPs) in contexts such as veterinary and dental services, focusing on their influence on brand recommendations and environmental sustainability.

"This study analyzed the perceived effects of COVID-19 on smallholder farmers’ agricultural production practices in the South Wollo and Oromo Administrative Zones of Ethiopia. Data were collected from 270 randomly selected respondents from September 5 to October 10, 2020. Data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The severity of problems is analyzed using a four-point Likert scale. The quantitative data were analyzed using mean and one sample t-test, while qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The one sample t-test result revealed that the respondents' level of agreement is statistically and significantly different from neutral in all cases at the 95 and 99% levels of confidence. These immediate problems caused the smallholder farmers to develop concerns about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Smallholder farmers in Jige faced challenges like a lack of markets, collaboration issues, delayed agricultural activities, spoilage of produce, labour issues, and increased input prices. The government and development practitioners should prioritize timely agricultural input delivery through cooperative unions, transfer of information and advisory services, and the marketing of agricultural products using alternative strategies.

"Purpose: This article investigates how medical specialists as professionals and elective cosmetic surgery tourists as consumers relationally negotiate decisions within the cosmetic surgery clinic. Drawing on a Goffmanian approach, this article explores the processual social structures that shape consumer logics in the clinic as a social space and as a type of professional institution. Design/methodology/approach: This article is based on ethnographic fieldwork in cosmetic surgery clinics in South Korea. Findings: This article identifies two genres of professional strategies (spatial arrangements and dramaturgical performances) that are leveraged by medical specialists to assert control over and persuade consumers to purchase cosmetic surgery. Research limitations/implications: The valorization of surgery captured in this article suggests that surgical modifications may serve as another vehicle for entrenching class inequality between those able and those unable to afford surgery. Practical implications: This article offers recommendations for future policymaking in terms of the regulatory oversight of the consumer profiles eligible for surgery and the marketing practices of clinics.

"Research purpose. The main goal of the article is to determine the current level of financial literacy among clients of the selected bank in Slovakia. This finding will be compared with the average level in the country. In the survey, we focused on determining their financial literacy level. Currently, a lot of attention is paid to the issue of financial literacy. In connection with financial literacy, a lot is said about education. Therefore, in the paper, we focused on finding out the relationship between financial literacy and the level of education as such. We also compared the financial literacy of the survey sample with the overall financial literacy in Slovakia. Design / Methodology / Approach. For the purposes of this article, an anonymous online questionnaire survey focused on the financial literacy of customers of the selected bank was conducted. By analysing theoretical knowledge and existing surveys, we established hypotheses, which we subsequently verified statistically. When analysing theoretical knowledge and surveys in the Slovak Republic, we found that there is a large number of surveys focused on financial literacy. The output and support of each of them are primarily focused on increasing financial literacy through education. We, therefore, assumed, given that financial literacy has been in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools for several years, that financial literacy is related to the availability of goods. We also assumed that financial literacy in the Slovak Republic is increasing. To verify the hypothesis, we used two statistical methods - the Chi-Square test and the Mean Congruence Test. The reason for choosing customers of a specific bank for the purposes of our survey was the number of respondents' answers. We managed to collect the most answers for the bank mentioned. Findings. Through the selected statistical method, we found that in our survey, the number of correct answers is not affected by the level of education. It was also interesting to find that the level of financial literacy of the selected region in 2022 is not higher than the overall level of financial literacy of the Slovak Republic determined on the basis of a survey from 2012. Originality / Value / Practical implications. The proposals and recommendations that emerged from the survey relate to increasing the financial literacy of customers of the selected bank. We focused our recommendations on education and conducting surveys, both for customers and for the bank's management. The bank can use these recommendations as a basis for managerial decisions. It is necessary to increase the financial literacy of customers. It is also necessary to support the field of marketing, especially communication with customers. It is only up to the management of the bank to decide which customers it will have and how it will retain or expand them.  © 2023 Eva Kicova et al.",Kicova E.; Ponisciakova O.; Rosnerova Z.,Out of scope,10.2478/jec-2023-0008,Customer; Financial literacy; Management; Managerial decision-making,,10.0,0,90,Sciendo,"The article focuses on assessing financial literacy among bank clients in Slovakia, which falls under financial services rather than marketing-related applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Financial Literacy of Customers of the Selected Slovak Bank as a Basis for Managerial Decision-Making,2023
"Regression analysis is a widely used modelling tool in business decision making. However, proper application of this methodology requires that certain assumptions, associated with the model, be satisfied. The assumption we focus on is the normality of the response variable, which is directly related to the assumption of normality of the error component. In a variety of fields in business, such as finance, marketing, information systems, operations, and healthcare, the selected dependent variable does not inherently have a normal distribution. In the regression context, where the model parameters and independent variables are assumed to be constant, the distribution of the random error component thus influences the distribution of the dependent variable. Here, we study the impact of symmetric and asymmetric error distributions on the performance of the estimated model parameters. To create robust estimates, through a process of trimming the response variable, we study the effectiveness of the trimmed estimators with respect to the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) via a simulation procedure. Accordingly, to minimise the ratio of the mean squared error of the trimmed estimator to that of the OLS, a recommendation is developed for the optimal trimming proportion. © Operational Research Society 2021.",Mitra A.; Kalgotra P.,Out of scope,10.1080/2573234X.2021.2007803,Analytics; kurtosis; mean square error; optimal trimming proportion; simulation; skewness; trimmed estimator,10.0,,10,60,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses regression analysis and statistical methods primarily applicable in various fields such as finance, marketing, operations, and healthcare, but does not directly relate to marketing decisions or strategic implementation in marketing contexts.",scopus-recommendation,10,10,Optimal trimming proportion in regression analysis for non-normal distributions,2022
"Purpose: Health systems are progressively stressed by health spending, which is partially explained by the increase in the cost of health technologies. Countries have defined processes to prioritize interventions to be covered. This study aims to compare for the first time health technology assessment (HTA) processes in Canada and Chile, to explain the factors driving these decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This is a health policy analysis comparing HTA processes in Canada and Chile. An analysis of publicly available documents in Canada (for CADTH) and Chile (for the Ministry of Health (MoH)) was carried out. A recognized political science framework (the 3-I framework) was used to explain the similarities and differences in both countries. The comparison of processes was disaggregated into eligibility and evaluation processes. Findings: CADTH has different programmes for different types of drugs (with two separate expert committees), whereas the MoH has a unified process. Although CADTH’s recommendations have a federal scope, the final coverage is a provincial decision. In Chile, the recommendation has a national scope. In both cases, past recommendations influence the scope of the evaluation. Pharmaceutical companies and patient associations are important interest groups in both countries. Whereas manufacturers and tumour groups are able to submit applications to CADTH, the Chilean MoH prioritizes applications submitted by patient associations. Originality/value: Institutions, interests and ideas play important roles in driving HTA decisions in Canada and Chile, which is demonstrated in this novel analysis.

"Purpose: This investigation builds on two domains. First, professional service providers, such as dentists and veterinarians, represent an understudied link in the distribution channel. Their recommendation of products, such as toothpaste and pet food, are impactful to their clientele. Second, for consumers, sustainability is growing as a motivating factor in product consideration. Consequently, brands committed to sustainability want to promote their products accordingly to connect with the consumer. The purpose of this study is to determine how to trust in sustainable brands is built in the mind of professional service providers, as they are influential in their clients’ decision process. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model that predicted how brand trust of sustainable products is built in the mind of the professional service provider using a sample of 457 veterinarians. Findings: Results revealed that trust in sustainable brands is built via professionals’ expertise in sustainability and their perception of the importance of sustainability. Additionally, the perception of altruistic motivations had a positive impact on brand trust while the perception of strategic motivations had no influence on trust in sustainable brands. Originality/value: Previous studies typically examine sustainability in an organizational context or as a brand consideration factor for consumers. This research focuses on professional service providers, who operate independently of the organization, alongside the formal distribution channel. The study examines how their perception of sustainability importance and their perceived motives of brands engaging in sustainability activities impacts their trust in sustainable brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Stoica M.; Hickman T.M.,Out of scope,10.1108/JPBM-05-2021-3466,Brand evaluation; Brand image; Brand trust; Cause related marketing; Professional service provider; Social responsibility; Sustainability; Values,,0.0,0,100,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on professional service providers such as veterinarians and their trust in sustainable brands, which is outside the marketing context and relates more to healthcare and professional services.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Sustainability through the lens of the professional adviser: the case for brand trust,2022
"Background: The purpose of this study is to construct and validate a measurement model of women’s preferences in Obstetrician and Gynecologist (OB/GYN) selection in the private sector of non-clinical parameters. Methods: This methodological study included 462 respondents in OB/GYN’s offices to a researcher-made questionnaire. The patients visited 57 offices of OB/GYNs in the city of Mashhad in Iran and completed women’s preferences in OB/GYN selection questionnaire over a 2-month period from January to February 2018. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to verify the instrument’s construct validity. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to test whether the data fit our hypothesized model obtained from EFA model. Results: The first draft of the questionnaire was prepared with 118 items based on literature review. The outcome of content validity assessment was a 51-item questionnaire. Scale-Content Validity Index (S-CVI) turned out to be 0.80. The results of EFA yielded an instrument with 33 items in six domains, which explained 52.657% of the total variance of the questionnaire. With performing CFA, the 6-factor model with 29 items demonstrated a good fit with the data (CFI=0.952, CMIN/DF=1.613, RMSEA=0.036). Availability and Accessibility, Communicational Skills, Office Environment, Recommendation by Others, Special Services, and Cost and Insurance were found to define the women’s preferences in OB/GYN selection in private sector, Iran. Conclusion: The developed measurement model considers the patient’s preferences that influence decision-making process on OB/GYN selection. It can provide useful knowledge for OB/GYNs and policymakers to design appropriate and efficient marketing strategies according to the consumer preferences priority. © 2020, Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

"Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is commonly used to manage symptoms in conditions and diseases for which there is limited clinical research for its application. How consumers arrive and decide to use CBD for medical treatment, despite lacking clinical evidence, is largely unknown. In this paper, we seek to identify the informational pathways through which consumers arrive at CBD for medical purposes. Methods: GoFundMe.com campaigns fundraising to purchase CBD between June 2017 and May 2019 were collected using the Crowdfunding for Health Research Portal (CHRP). Product descriptions were thematically analyzed to determine pathways leading to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment. Campaign characteristics such as fundraising ask, funding received, location, campaign title, description, Facebook shares, and number of donors were recorded. Specific medical uses of CBD proposed in campaigns were tabulated. Results: The study identified 164 crowdfunding campaigns primarily from the USA (n=159), with several from Canada (n=5). The campaigns requested $2,219,284.24 (median, $7000) and raised $610,612.87 (median, $1805) from 6825 donors (median, 26). Many campaigns asked for other treatments or illness-related costs not specific to CBD. The campaigns were shared 42,299 times on Facebook (median, 156 shares). Three informational pathways were identified leading to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment, which were self-directed research (n=149), recommendations from a trusted care provider (n=36), and/or experiential insights shared by someone associated with or influencing the crowdfunders personal network (n=30). The proposed uses of CBD were for cancer (n=96), seizure-inducing diseases/conditions (n=48), other/unspecified (n=6), joint/inflammatory diseases (n=6), mental health disorders (n=3), nervous system diseases (n=3), and autoimmune diseases (n=2). Conclusions: Our results suggest that consumers crowdfunding come to CBD through internally motivated reasons versus exposure to advertisements or other forms of marketing. Campaign beneficiaries generally had an unmet medical need that other forms of treatment were not satisfying. Then, through one or more of the informational pathways identified, CBD is considered a potential solution. © 2021, The Author(s).",Zenone M.A.; Snyder J.; Crooks V.A.,Out of scope,10.1186/s42238-021-00069-x,Cannabidiol; Cannabis; Crowdfunding; Decision-making; Medical treatment,,0.0,0,100,BioMed Central Ltd,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior related to the use of CBD for medical purposes, which falls under healthcare and not marketing.

"As a result of creative accounting, many firms in the Iraqi stock market are able to achieve two very significant goals: first, to boost the market value of their shares and thus gain the biggest trading volume in shares, and second, to lower their earnings in order to decrease the tax burden. First by growing its profits, then by evading taxes and denying the state its right to its money. Using this research, we hope to demonstrate how financial institutions that use innovative accounting tools in the preparation of their financial statements impact trade activity. Trading volume is critical to accurately forecasting stock price patterns, allowing investors to maximize their wealth. So, without accounting information, the financial markets can't play their function in drawing in investment, ensuring a well-balanced use of resources, and making reasonable economic decisions, because they don't have the accounting knowledge to do so. There were four sections to the research, which included a look at the research methodology and previous studies, a look at creative accounting practices, and an analysis of the financial statements for the top and bottom ten companies in terms of trading volume using Miller's model to detect profit manipulation that occurred in those companies.

"Access to medicines treating rare diseases (‘orphan medicines’) has proven challenging due to high prices and clinical uncertainty. To optimise market access to these medicines, some healthcare systems are implementing specialised pathways and/or processes during marketing authorisation (MA) and/or health technology assessment (HTA). Comparing one setting where these medicines are classed as “orphan” (Scotland) to another where they considered “non-orphan” (Canada), this study aims to explore whether the presence of specialised pathways and processes at MA and HTA levels is associated with more favourable funding recommendations and faster time to market access. A matched sample of 116 medicine-indication pairs with MA approval from 2001 to 2019 in Europe and Canada was identified, and publicly available sources were used for data extraction. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. All medicines were commercially marketed in both countries, except one instance in Scotland. In Scotland, more orphan medicines (68.1%) had a favourable HTA recommendation than in Canada (60.4%), while Canada issued more negative HTA recommendations (20.7%) than Scotland (15.5%). Low levels of agreement on HTA recommendations and the main reasons driving recommendations were found between settings. In both countries, medicines with specialised MA approval were less likely to receive negative HTA recommendations than medicines with standard MA. Time to market access was faster in Canada than Scotland, though medicines with specialised MA approval had slower timelines than medicines with standard MA approval in both countries. However, it is unclear whether the presence of orphan designation and HTA specialised processes alone could result in favourable funding recommendations without accounting for other healthcare system-related factors and differences in the decision-making processes across settings. Holistic approaches and better alignment of evidentiary requirements across regulators are needed to optimise access to orphan medicines. © 2022",Fontrier A.-M.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115119,Access; Health technology assessment; HTA; Marketing authorisation; Orphan medicines; Rare diseases; Specialised pathways; Specialised processes,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract focuses on the challenges and processes related to access to orphan medicines, which falls outside the realm of marketing-related decisions and applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Market access for medicines treating rare diseases: Association between specialised processes for orphan medicines and funding recommendations,2022
"Emphasized by the World Health Organization as one of its key topics, patient empowerment (PE)-i.e., the set of self-determined behaviors based on patients' individual needs for developing autonomy and competence with their disease-is today regarded as a key component of a patient-centered approach to healthcare. Unfortunately, research lacks a clear understanding of the drivers of PE, its relationship to therapy compliance, and its role in different types of diseases. Using a large sample of 1622 patients suffering from chronic diseases, this study addresses these critical research gaps and provides three major contributions. First, by exploring the influence of PE antecedents (i.e., patients' health involvement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of physician authority), it provides specific recommendations on how to effectively manage PE (defined in terms of three dimensions: information search, knowledge development, and decision participation). Second, it demonstrates the importance of PE and its antecedents for affecting patients' therapy compliance and shows that, depending on the PE dimension, therapy compliance is either enhanced or reduced. By highlighting the ambiguous role of PE in therapy compliance, the study offers specific suggestions for healthcare stakeholders on how to maximize patients' compliance to recommended therapies. Third, the study provides important insights into the role of PE across different types of chronic diseases, offering practical recommendations on how to deal with patients depending on their particular disease. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Prigge J.-K.; Dietz B.; Homburg C.; Hoyer W.D.; Burton J.L.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.05.009,Healthcare marketing; Patient behavior; Patient empowerment; Therapy compliance,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses patient empowerment in healthcare, which is not related to marketing applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Patient empowerment: A cross-disease exploration of antecedents and consequences,2015
"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship among jurors’ attribution of responsibility of the error, patient styles and juror decisions (e.g. acquittal of the physician). Specifically, this research examines the influence of an individual’s approach to their healthcare (active vs. passive), and decisions to acquit in malpractice cases. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 459 individuals were surveyed using a commercial call center for participation in a corresponding mail survey. Surveys were also distributed to undergraduate business students at a Midwestern university. Findings: Cluster analysis revealed two categories of patient styles: “active patients” (39.4 per cent) and “passive patients” (60.6 per cent). Regardless of patient style, this research found all respondents viewed medical error disclosure as important. However, respondents in the passive group were more likely to acquit the physician and the hospital nursing staff as compared with those classified as active. Practical implications: The safety of patients in the healthcare system and prevention of errors is a critical issue. However, when errors occur, medical providers should disclose information to the patient and take responsibility to attenuate their negative impact. Further, this research reveals that patients who rely more on their physicians, trust their recommendations and question physicians less are more likely to acquit. Medical providers can use this information as motivation to continue to build this type of trust with their patients. Originality/value: Medical errors are costly for all parties involved.

"Devolution in forestry generally refers to the transfer of some degree of central government authority to local responsibility. It commonly takes the form of recommendations by external advisors in developing country situations who encourage formally organized decision making by a local political community. This paper reviews the literature on local tenure, the summaries of case studies in forestry, and the broader history of experience with collectives and cooperatives with the objective of identifying the characteristic cases where some form of collective or community forest management might be successful. The paper identifies four cases. It concludes that, at some level, smaller groups of managers may cooperate in labor and capital intensive activities like fire control or harvesting, or in specialized activities beyond their personal expertise, activities like processing and marketing their products.

"Objective: Conflicts of interests resulting from interactions with pharmaceutical companies are pervasive in medicine and can result in an undue influence on physicians’ decision-making. The objective of this systematic review is to analyze published and scientifically evaluated curricula for medical students and residents regarding such conflicts of interest. We begin by describing the covered topics and teaching methods; afterwards we analyze the quality of the curricula using the published data on their evaluations and comparing the content with content recommended for such curricula. Methods: We searched Pubmed, Psyclnfo, EMBASE, OECD, WISO, SOWI and googlescholar up to and including the 5th of September 2016. Publications describing curricula for residents or medical students on the topic of conflicts of interest in medicine and evaluating them for their effects on the participants’ learning were included. We analyzed the covered topics and the teaching methods used and compared them with recommendations by the American Medical Students’ Association (AMSA) and Health Action International (HAI). Results: The literature search resulted in 20 publications that fulfilled our search criteria. In five trials, a control group was used, in no trial the participants were randomized to intervention or control group. 16/20 published curricula primarily covered marketing strategies by pharmaceutical companies, especially the interaction with pharmaceutical sales representatives (PSRs). Most curricula only covered a limited number of topics recommended by AMSA/HAI. The most frequent teaching method was a group discussion, which was used in 18/20 curricula; all curricula used at least one interactive teaching method. The evaluation of the curricula was heterogeneous in results as well as design. Some publications described a change of attitudes toward a stronger skepticism regarding interactions with pharmaceutical companies. Four publications described improved knowledge, one publication described a change in behavior toward a reduction of the acceptance of gifts. Conclusion: The trials conducted to this date regarding curricula on conflicts of interests are methodologically flawed and the described curricula lack important topics beyond marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are no data so far on the sustainability of the courses’ effects on participants* behavior. It is therefore necessary to develop a model curriculum that covers a broader variety of topics and to evaluate it using a well thought-out methodology to create a foundation for the further improvement of teaching conflicts of interest in medicine. © 2017 Weißkircher et al.",Weißkircher J.; Koch C.; Dreimüller N.; Lieb K.,Out of scope,10.3205/zma001114,Advertising as topic; Conflict of interest; Curriculum; Drug industry; Medical education; Medical/psychology students,,0.0,0,100,Gesellschaft fur Medizinische Ausbildung,"The abstract discusses conflicts of interest in medical education regarding pharmaceutical companies, which is not related to marketing in the context specified.

"The purpose of this research involves understanding individual motivations for volunteering in clinical trials and/or health-related product tests. Identifying the reasons leading to participation in clinical studies also ensures researchers are in a position to outline projects that benefit patients as well as predicting eventual barriers that might otherwise constrain their involvement. In this context, the paper seeks to reinforce the importance of marketing strategies for recruiting and retaining volunteers as well as gasping the most effective kind of approach (promotional, communicational, economic incentives, among others). This study is based on exploratory research, deploying a deductive method, bailing up statistical methods in order to identify the motivations influencing volunteers over healthcare related product test participation. The results reveal that participants attach high importance to health professional recommendations within the scope of their motivations for participating in clinical trials. The motivations related to logistical factors (such as time and location) prove relevant to helping in the process of clinical trial participation decision making as well as deciding on the preferred alternative incentives (discount coupons, vouchers, etc.). Participants consider that information provided in hospitals, clinics, and health centers encourages interest in clinical trial participation taking into account that these are studies in the health area and the information provided by these institutions, therefore, probably receives correspondingly greater credibility. © 2015 The Author(s).",Paco A.; Ferreira M.; Leal J.,Out of scope,10.1177/1745790416650602,Clinical trials; Communication strategies; Health-related product testing; Marketing strategies; Motivations,,0.0,0,100,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract focuses on motivations for volunteering in clinical trials and health-related product tests, which are related to healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Motivations for participating in clinical trials and health-related product testing,2015

"Infant mortality and morbidity risk is linked to formula usage. The proportion of Filipino infant formula users rose 6% between 2003 and 2008. It is hypothesized this rise resulted from aggressive formula industry marketing.We conducted a household survey between April and December 2006 and focus groups in April-May 2007 in The Philippines to examine the association between mothers' exposure to advertising and other information sources and formula feeding decisions. Sixteen barangays (communities) were randomly selected from three purposively selected disadvantaged rural, urban and mixed municipalities. A total of 345 households had children under 24-months age: 114, 142 and 89 households from the rural, urban and mixed municipalities, respectively. In addition 38 respondents participated in 3 focus groups of 10-15 participants each, from three selected barangays.After adjusting for education and economic indicators logistic regression analysis showed that, children were more likely to be given formula if their mother recalled advertising messages, or a doctor, or mother or relative recommended it. Those using formula were 6.4 (1.8-23.1) times more likely to stop breastfeeding before 12 months. The focus groups described how television advertisements, doctors and medical representatives enticed them to use formula. We conclude that two factors were strongly associated with the decision to formula feed: self-reported advertising exposure, and physicians' recommendations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Sobel H.L.; Iellamo A.; Raya R.R.; Padilla A.A.; Olivé J.-M.; Nyunt-U S.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.029,Breast milk substitutes; Breastfeeding; Formula feeding; International code; Marketing; The Philippines,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses infant formula usage and its association with advertising and physician recommendations, which falls under healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Is unimpeded marketing for breast milk substitutes responsible for the decline in breastfeeding in the Philippines?

"Motivation is a subject that is constantly discussed in the field of education. Teachers are taught not only to teach their students, but to motivate them to want to learn. As students get older, intrinsic motivation tends to decrease; therefore it becomes more difficult for teachers to motivate students (Ryan and Deci, 2000a). According to self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci, 2000a, 2000b), students' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness must be met in order to experience positive social development and growth. When these needs are met, students experience high levels of self-motivation. Offering choice in the classroom is one way to increase student motivation by appealing to students' needs for autonomy and competence. In the fields of marketing, economics and social psychology, decision-making research is examined as a way to shape consumers' preferences. This literature review will aim to utilise and possibly translate some of these findings to an educational setting. By examining the aspect of choice in separate fields, it can be seen that there is still much to be researched in the field of education. Recommendations for future research on choice in the field of education are made. © 2015 NASEN.",Thompson M.; Beymer P.,Out of scope,10.1111/1467-9604.12086,Autonomy; Choice; Competence; Motivation; Self-determination,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses motivation in education and relates concepts from self-determination theory and decision-making research, which are not directly related to marketing or its applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,The effects of choice in the classroom: Is there too little or too much choice?,2015
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the most important influencing factors in choosing a hospital by a patient. Design/methodology/approach: This study involved a mixed research design. Focus groups and in-depth individual interviews were conducted with patients to explore reasons for choosing a hospital. In addition, this study involved survey-based research on the patient choice. Findings: Type of the hospital, type of the service, word of mouth, cost of services, the health insurance programme, location, physical environment, facilities, providers' expertise and interpersonal behaviour, and reputation of the hospital influenced patients' choice of a hospital. Doctor recommendations and health insurance programme were the main reasons for choosing a hospital for inpatients and outpatients respectively. Practical implications: Identifying and understanding key factors that influence a patient choice of a healthcare setting helps managers and policy makers invest their resources in those critical areas and improve those aspects of their services to attract more patients.

"The use of evidence-based medical practice has become the standard for health care decision-making. Thus, it has become increasingly important for medical device manufactures to provide evidence for the efficacy of their products. As new products, services, and solutions are developed, it is important to perform a stakeholder analysis to assess clinical evidence needs. As evidenced by the variety of stakeholders in clinical trials, we expect that each has different interests in how clinical trials are developed, conducted, and promoted to the general public.

"Background: New oral anticoagulants have similar efficacy and lower bleeding rates compared with warfarin. However, in case of bleeding there is no specific antidote to reverse their effects. We evaluated the preferences and values of anticoagulants of patients at risk of atrial fibrillation and those who have already made a decision regarding anticoagulation. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of Veterans in the primary care clinics and the international normalized ratio (INR) laboratory. We developed an instrument with patient and physician input to measure patient values and preferences. The survey contained a hypothetical scenario of the risk of atrial fibrillation and the attributes of each anticoagulant. After the scenario, we asked participants to choose the option that best fits their preferences. The options were: 1) has better efficacy at reducing risk of stroke; 2) has been in the market for a long period of time; 3) has an antidote to reverse the rare case of bleeding; 4) has better quality of life profile with no required frequent laboratory tests; or 5) I want to follow physician recommendations. We stratified our results by those patients who are currently exposed to anticoagulants and those who are not exposed but are at risk of atrial fibrillation. Results: We approached 173 Veterans and completed 137 surveys (79% response rate). Ninety subjects were not exposed to anticoagulants, 46 reported being on warfarin, and one reported being on dabigatran at the time of the survey. Ninety-eight percent of subjects stated they would like to participate in the decision-making process of selecting an anticoagulant. Thirty-six percent of those exposed and 37% of those unexposed to anticoagulants reported that they would select a medication that has an antidote even if the risk of bleeding was very small. Twenty-three percent of the unexposed and 22% of the exposed groups reported that they would prefer the medication that gives the best quality of life. Conclusion: Our study found that patients who may be exposed to an anticoagulation decision prefer to actively participate in the decision-making process, and have individual values for making a decision that cannot be predicted or assumed by anyone in the health care system. © 2015 Palacio et al.",Palacio A.M.; Kirolos I.; Tamariz L.,Out of scope,10.2147/PPA.S64295,Atrial fibrillation; Bleeding risk; Medication selection; Oral anticoagulant; Patient decision making; Warfarin,,0.0,0,100,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,"The abstract discusses patient preferences regarding anticoagulant choices in a healthcare context, which does not relate to marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Patient values and preferences when choosing anticoagulants,2015
"Based on a realist conceptualization of interests, this paper explores how commercial and scientific priorities appear to have converged and diverged during the development of the antidepressant Zelmid. The drug represents the first of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to reach the market. Zelmid was synthesized in 1971 and launched by the Swedish firm Astra in 1982, but subsequently withdrawn the next year because of adverse neurological effects. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with scientists representing both industry and academia who had high-level involvement in various phases of the project (experimental, pre-clinical and clinical), as well as on textual sources such as scientific articles and memoirs. Zelmid was a product of mechanism-based or ""rational"" drug discovery from the early 1960s and the associated intermingling of science and commerce. It is argued that both scientists and the pharmaceutical company shared an interest in embracing mechanism-based drug discovery because it simultaneously promised medico-scientific advances and profits. However, the intermingling of science and commerce also strained the relationship between scientific and commercial priorities further along the trajectory of the drug; for example, concerning issues such as dosage strategy and drug use in primary care, where corporate management allegedly took decisions contrary to the recommendations of both academic and company scientists. On such occasions the asymmetry in power became apparent in scientists' narratives: commercial considerations trumped those of science since, ultimately, decisions rest with management, not with scientists. In addition, temporality appears to be associated with the divergence of commercial and scientific priorities. While rare during experimental and pre-clinical phases, divergence was concentrated downstream to the clinical testing and post-marketing phases. It is hypothesized that a similar pattern of convergence and divergence of commercial and scientific priorities may exist in the trajectory of other drugs. © 2015 The Author.",Mulinari S.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.06.020,Antidepressant; Drug development; History; Interests; Pharmaceutical industry; Psychiatry; SSRI; Sweden,0.0,,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The content of the abstract focuses on the development of a pharmaceutical drug and the interplay between scientific and commercial interests, which does not relate to marketing applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,"Divergence and convergence of commercial and scientific priorities in drug development: The case of Zelmid, the first SSRI antidepressant",2015
"Genetic testing is currently subject to little oversight, despite the significant ethical issues involved. Repeated recommendations for increased regulation of the genetic testing market have led to little progress in the policy arena. A 2005 Internet search identified 13 websites offering health-related genetic testing for direct purchase by the consumer. Further examination of these sites showed that overall, biotech companies are not providing enough information for consumers to make well-informed decisions; they are not consistently offering genetic counseling services; and some sites even offer tests with little evidence of clinical value. This article aims to raise company and consumer awareness about the ethical concerns surrounding the direct-to-consumer marketing of health-related genetic tests. It also suggests ways that biotech companies can bring their services to the public in an ethically responsible manner, without increased regulatory oversight. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Berg C.; Fryer-Edwards K.,Out of scope,10.1007/s10551-006-9298-8,Direct-to-consumer marketing; Direct-to-consumer sales; DNA test; Genetic test; Internet; Marketing ethics,0.0,,0,100,,"The abstract discusses genetic testing and its ethical implications, which are not related to marketing but rather to healthcare and regulatory issues.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,The ethical challenges of direct-to-consumer genetic testing,2008
"Forest management in Central and Eastern Europe, under direct or indirect Soviet influence, for a long time followed different management objectives and strategies as compared to the forest management in countries with market economies in Western Europe located in the same biogeographic zones. In the light of the appearing paradigms of natural disturbance regimes and ecosystem-based forest management we evaluate forest management in the former Soviet Union and Sweden with respect to conservation of riparian forest ecotones. We studied the site and forest age class distribution both along watercourses and at randomly selected locations in the surrounding terrain in managed landscapes in Sweden and the former Soviet Union, respectively. Along watercourses in the former Soviet Union 20% of the overall forest cover was classified as old-growth compared with 6% in the surrounding landscape. By contrast, although the proportion of site type distribution was similar, such forests were neither found along watercourses nor in the surrounding landscape in Sweden. The results hence show that the Soviet management policy resulted in better conditions from the biodiversity conservation perspective. We conclude that the forestry decision-making environment does matter for practical forest conservation. We also make the following recommendations to forest and environmental planners and decision-makers: (1) protect existing and restore and re-create riparian corridors in general; (2) maintain riparian forests along streams of all orders, because small rivers are as important for conservation of biodiversity as large rivers; (3) designate riparian corridors for protection not focusing on a single width, but rather based on vegetation site type appropriate for stand types with a continuous forest cover. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"With the introduction of the Australian Organ Donation Register, responsibility regarding organ donation decisions primarily rests with the individual. However, family members can be instrumental in facilitating or hindering the rate of organ donation by objecting to or confirming the individual's wishes. Attitudes and beliefs of family members have been shown to be a strong influence on people's intentions to donate. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that family communication about organ donation can improve the rate of organ donation. We surveyed 23 matched pairs of undergraduate university students and their parents and found that attitudes to organ donation were positive and that there was a tendency for these dyads to give concordant responses regarding attitudes, level of family communication, and intent to donate. These findings have implications for improving Australia's organ donation rate, and recommendations for messages promoting organ donation are discussed.",Jones S.C.; Reis S.L.; Andrews K.L.,Out of scope,10.1080/15245000902894040,,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses organ donation and the influences on decision-making regarding it, which falls outside the realm of marketing applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Communication about organ donation intentions: Formative research for a social marketing program targeting families,2009
"This research investigated the issues and methods of analysis considered by executives when managing biotechnology drug candidates within the research and development (R&D) pipeline. A mail survey was developed to assess: (1) factors considered during clinical trials; (2) sources of funding for R&D; (3) analytic tools used in decision-making; and (4) the use and application of pharmacoeconomics, and targeted primarily Chief Financial Officers (CFO) within 396 biotechnology firms in the United States (US). Consistent with prior research on CFOs, a response rate of 7.5 per cent was achieved and respondents generally represented smaller biotechnology companies valued below US$100m. Findings indicated that regulatory and capital requirements as well as investor expectations were important factors throughout clinical phase trials. Venture capital and capital/securities markets were the most commonly used sources of R&D capital. The most frequently cited decision-making techniques used included prior experience/intuition/ human judgment, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Pharmacoeconomic methods were utilised at every stage of R&D and applied to the management of R&D pipelines in addition to aspects of product pricing and reimbursement. Overall, these results reflect the nature of risk and uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D. Although the use of past experience/intuition/human judgment was most common for decision-making, methods based upon discounted cash flow (DCF) approaches were also employed frequently, as was the use of pharmacoeconomics. The implications of this work should seek to catalyse the development and utilisation of robust methods to manage drug pipelines such that senior executives are afforded optimal recommendations when attempting to hedge risk and maximise return.",Skrepnek G.H.; Sarnowski J.J.,Out of scope,10.1057/palgrave.jcb.3050040,,0.0,,0,100,,"The abstract primarily discusses issues related to biotechnology drug candidates and R&D management, which is not related to marketing activities.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Decision-making associated with drug candidates in the biotechnology research and development (R&D) pipeline,2007
"Extensive shooting and angling causes, indirectly, fatal lead poisoning of birds. European Union policy on this major source of pollution is inconsistent with its laws regulating other forms of lead in the environment. Only three countries have banned the use of lead shot completely in the European Union, despite availability of substitutes and evidence that their use is a major contributor to bird conservation. The European Commission uses the criterion of amount of lead deposited and corroded, and the concentration of lead in water and soil, as the basis of their decisions. The USA and Canada used the prevalence of lead poisoning among birds as the basis of policy and law allowing them to reduce lead use at the continental level. The EU and North American policies and law on lead reduction are compared in this study, on the basis of which recommendations are developed indicating how the EU could revise its approach and resolve this environmental problem. Reluctance to act on lead reduction by the European Parliament and its member states refl ects the current vested interests of the sporting communities.

"Organ donation consent rates have stagnated at about 50%, while the need for transplantable organs continues to increase. This article focuses on consent rates of families who make a donation decision for a deceased loved one, and how social marketing efforts to increase organ donation can be enhanced by better understanding the decision-making process these families use. Three categories of factors bear significantly on that decision which, if not addressed properly, will very likely result in a refusal to donate. These deal breaker categories include (1) family predisposition and family care, (2) requestor characteristics, and (3) request dynamics. Recommendations are made toward developing best practices protocols which roughly parallel promotion activities and the selling process utilized in commercial marketing for overcoming these barriers.",Aldridge A.; Guy B.S.,Out of scope,10.1080/07359680802131509,Consent barriers; Consent rates; Organ donation; Request process; Transplantation,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses organ donation consent rates and factors influencing family decisions, which are primarily related to healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Deal breakers in the organ donation request process,2008
"The report card concept does not connote a single instrument used for a single purpose, or for all instances of outcomes data reporting. Uniquely defined report cards can be useful to organizations and their stakeholders. Health care executives competing for marketshare in an era of negotiated prices and payor-controlled access to healthcare services must provide information about clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and organizational performance to those who are responsible for selecting health providers or health plans. The organization's leaders must view the reporting process as important from a strategic perspective, and establish processes and allocate resources to produce a report in an efficient and cost-effective manner that will meet the information needs of key stakeholders. Developing useful outcomes report cards will require collaboration among many individuals in an organization, and perhaps collaboration among organizations in a market area. Expected benefits to the organization include improvement in stakeholder relationships, which might be measured through increased market share. The proposed implementation model is based on a synthesis of processes and recommendations reported in the literature extended by information from an in-depth case study. Problematic issues with outcomes data and public reporting have been considered. Although the model is derived from a conceptual and research base, it is both pragmatic in design, and solution- centered. Research questions for future empirical research might include the following: Which stakeholders are appropriate recipients of what types of information? How do different stakeholders evaluate the relative importance of each type of information? Which reporting formats are more appropriate for which stakeholders? What effect does a truncated decision-making process (such as the one described here) have on the effectiveness of the decision- making process?

"During the past several years, there has been a myriad of recommendations for strategies to control internal parasites of beef cattle. The problem is not so much that many approaches exist but that management strategies for beef cattle vary dramatically throughout North America. The variations in climate, forages, classes of cattle raised, seasonally of breeding, calving, and marketing all contribute to management decisions made by the livestock producer and veterinarian. Thus, no one approach best serves the needs of all livestock producers. In this column, geography and climate, class of cattle raised, and general management schemes are used as the basis for developing guidelines for rational parasite control programs for cattle. The selection of anthelmintic varies based on a number of considerations. The primary species of parasite and the stage of development are the most important criteria. In older cows that have acquired immunity, the relative efficacy of a drug is not as important as it is in naive replacement heifers. The ease of administration, cost of the drugs, and additional benefits (such as ectoparasite control) may aid in determining the best choice of anthelmintic for a particular situation. Controlling Ostertagia ostertagi should be the focus of a beef cattle parasite control program. Other important gastrointestinal nematodes are Cooperia species and Haemonchus.

"This study explored the rather rapid adoption of a new surgical device - the da Vinci robot - in the Netherlands despite the high costs and its controversial clinical benefits. We used the concept 'affordances' as a conceptual-analytic tool to refer to the perceived promises, symbolic meanings, and utility values of an innovation constructed in the wider social context of use. This concept helps us empirically understand robot adoption. Data from 28 in-depth interviews with diverse purposively-sampled stakeholders, and from medical literature, policy documents, Health Technology Assessment reports, congress websites and patients' weblogs/forums between April 2009 and February 2014 were systematically analysed from the perspective of affordances. We distinguished five interrelated affordances of the robot that accounted for shaping and fulfilling its rapid adoption: 'characteristics-related' affordances such as smart nomenclature and novelty, symbolising high-tech clinical excellence; 'research-related' affordances offering medical-technical scientific excellence; 'entrepreneurship-related' affordances for performing better-than-the-competition; 'policy-related' affordances indicating the robot's liberalised provision and its reduced financial risks; and 'communication-related' affordances of the robot in shaping patients' choices and the public's expectations by resonating promising discourses while pushing uncertainties into the background. These affordances make the take-up and use of the da Vinci robot sound perfectly rational and inevitable. This Dutch case study demonstrates the fruitfulness of the affordances approach to empirically capturing the contextual dynamics of technology adoption in health care: exploring in-depth actors' interaction with the technology while considering the interpretative spaces created in situations of use.

"Drawing on evidence from in-depth interviews and a household survey, the paper provides evidence on the farmers’ challenges in production, marketing and prices as well as how farmers perceive and deal with climate change impacts on coffee production in the Fero-two Peasant Association (PA) of the Wensho district of the Sidama region in southern Ethiopia. This includes prolonged dry season, erratic and insufficient rainfall, too early and too late rains and temperature rise. Unexpected heavy rains and snow events as well as weather change-driven pests and diseases negatively affect not only the volume of coffee production and quality but also the prices. The effects of climate change risks add pressure on the existing challenges such as land shortage and fragmentation, declining soil fertility and weeds. Lack of participation in decision-making and corruption are additional challenges for the coffee growers. Although the farmers rely on multiple production-related adaptation responses, most of the deployed strategies to the changing environment are less effective and short-term.

"Over the last decade, many organizations worldwide have been assimilating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to increase their productivity and attain a competitive advantage. As with any technology, intelligence systems come with potential downsides. Despite the efforts to mitigate any negative consequences of AI, businesses and employees continue to confront the dilemmas of adopting AI, so it is essential to explore in detail the rising concerns around such technologies. In this paper, we used a single case study to investigate the dark aspects of AI in a Norwegian energy trading firm. We gathered data through semi-structured interviews and secondary data. Specifically, we interviewed AI managers, traders and developers who have worked on deploying and using AI tools over the last three years. Our aim is to identify the dark side of AI use in trading, how AI trading bots affect the relationship between traders and AI developers and how the firm adjusts to this new reality. The findings indicate that negative or unintended consequences of AI can be grouped into three clusters related to (1) the nature of the work; (2) conflicts and effects; and (3) responsibility.

Findings Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3).

"Will consumers accept artificial intelligence (AI) as a medical care provider? On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers' interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.","Yun, JH; Lee, EJ; Kim, DH",Out of scope,10.1002/mar.21445,apathy; artificial intelligence; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; medical decision-making; personalization; prosociality,,0.0,0,100,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the acceptance of AI in medical care, which falls outside the marketing context, particularly focusing on healthcare, making it irrelevant to the given classifications.",wos-ai,0,0,Behavioral and neural evidence on consumer responses to human doctors and medical artificial intelligence,2021
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, yet little is known about how consumers experience medical AI and make decisions about using these providers for follow-up care. We take an interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioral and neuroimaging experiments to determine how anthropomorphism and personalization influence consumers' well-being and their decisions about a provider for follow-up care. Study 1 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, consumers are likely to experience a heightened sense of well-being after a highly personalized medical consultation. However, regardless of whether the first interaction is highly personalized or not, they prefer follow-up visits with a human doctor, as mediated through empathy. Study 2 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, the anterior cingulate cortex shows greater activation in a highly (vs. low) personalized interaction, the activation of which is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit that provider. Furthermore, the temporal occipital fusiform cortex shows greater activation in consultations with a human doctor (vs. medical AI), regardless of the interaction's level of personalization. The level of activation is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit with the initial provider. The findings suggest that medical AI cannot currently replace human doctors and that human doctors remain consumers' choice for medical consultations and treatment.","Zhang, YR; Tan, WY; Lee, EJ",Out of scope,10.1002/mar.21911,anthropomorphism; artificial intelligence; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; healthcare,,0.0,0,100,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the experience of consumers with medical AI in healthcare, which falls outside the realm of marketing applications.",wos-ai,0,0,Consumers' responses to personalized service from medical artificial intelligence and human doctors,2024
"We study the problem a diagnostic expert (e.g., a physician) faces when offering a diagnosis to a client (e.g., a patient) that may be based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability or supplemented by a diagnostic test-conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) tools alike-revealing the client's true condition. The expert's diagnostic ability (or type) is private information. The expert is impurely altruistic in that the expert cares about both the client's utility and the expert's own reputational payoff that depends on the peer perception of the expert's diagnostic ability. The decision of whether to perform the test, which is costly for the client, provides the expert with an opportunity to influence that perception. We show a unique separating equilibrium exists in which the high-type expert does not resort to diagnostic testing and offers a diagnosis based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability, whereas the low-type expert performs the test. Furthermore, we establish that high-type expert may skip necessary diagnostic tests to separate them from the low-type expert. Interestingly, the effect of reputational payoff on undertesting is nonmonotonic, and the desire to appear of high type leads to undertesting only when the reputational payoff is intermediate.

"The interplay between longevity risk and health state transitions for retirees' optimal annuitization decisions is investigated. Using a life-cycle framework incorporating wealth levels, bequest motives, and consumption floors created by government subsidies, we examine how increased longevity in conjunction with an individual's health state transition process impacts annuity purchase decisions. Health state transition matrices are estimated from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) data. The effects of increased longevity on annuitization decisions are considered when longevity is both accompanied by increased time spent in healthier states (morbidity compression) or experienced by more time in unhealthy states (morbidity expansion). We find that retirees' annuity demand is affected by wealth, initial health status, and expansion or compression of morbidity. Wealthier retirees have higher annuity demand when health shocks are considered, and increased longevity increases demand even more when retirees expect an expansion or slight morbidity compression. With health shocks and expectations of severe morbidity compression considered, the opposite effect might occur. Thus, an annuity can help retirees hedge health shock costs when slight compression or expansion of morbidity occurs. For retirees with lower wealth, the consumption floor provided by governmental subsidies will create a decreased propensity to annuitize.","Ai, J; Brockett, PL; Golden, LL; Zhu, W",Out of scope,10.1111/jori.12168,,0.0,,0,100,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the financial implications of longevity risk and health transitions for retirees, which falls under financial services rather than marketing.",wos-ai,0,0,Health State Transitions and Longevity Effects on Retirees' Optimal Annuitization,2017
"Understanding sectoral dynamic dependence across equity indexes is crucial for investment decisions and designing economic policy. This study examines the sectoral dependence among 82 Pakistani companies using a vine copula approach and daily data from July 1, 2014, to December 17, 2019. Vine copulas represent a flexible dependence approach capable of capturing the dynamic and complex relationships among equity sectors stemming from the nonlinear patterns of asymmetric behavior of returns that cannot be captured by linear dependence models. The results show that the Pakistani stock market is driven by the oil and gas marketing sector and oil and gas exploration sector, with high dependence on commercial banks, fertilizers, power generation and distribution, and automobile parts and accessories. The findings help explain the taildependence structure among equity stocks and sectors in the context of understudied emerging markets such as Pakistan, which is vital for portfolio management and designing sector-level policies.Copyright (c) 2022 Borsa Istanbul Anonim S , irketi .

"Access to credit is a key enabler of modern life. Yet many consumers face factors beyond their control which sometimes render them unable to borrow from mainstream lenders. This paper documents how firm-related factors determine lending thresholds and shape who is, or is not, a creditworthy customer. The impact of the 2008 economic recession on lending decisions is explored, an aspect that has been insufficiently discussed even though recessions are cyclical events. Drawing on semiotics and using multiple case studies, the study captures not only the groups that were excluded but also the reasons for exclusion.

"For many professional services, advice adherence is a necessary condition for achieving service success for both customers and service providers. Despite their pivotal roles in value co-creation, typical conversational interactions often lead to low adherence. We propose that enabling a dominance transition, from provider dominance in the pre-advice stage to customer dominance in the post-advice stage, enhances advice adherence because it increases customers' perceived common ground. Furthermore, providers' consultation focus, customers' prior knowledge, and customers' perceived adherence effort moderate this process. Using mixed methods, including both empirical modeling and controlled and field experiments, we validate the proposed model in various contexts (healthcare, financial services, and fitness and wellness counseling). The findings establish several theoretical contributions and offer managerial implications for improving advice adherence by managing dominance transitions in conversational interactions more effectively through training service providers or even programming AI chatbots.","Wang, HS; Yim, CK",Out of scope,10.1007/s11747-019-00664-8,Advice adherence; Professional service conversations; Conversational dominance; Dominance transitions; Customers' perceived common ground,5.0,,10,70,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses advice adherence in professional services such as healthcare, financial services, and fitness, which are not directly related to marketing.",wos-ai,5,10,Effects of dominance transitions on advice adherence in professional service conversations,2019
"Artificial Intelligence has the potential to improve human decisions in complex environments, but its effectiveness can remain limited if humans hold context-specific private information. Using the empirical example of antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections, we show that full automation of prescribing fails to improve on physician decisions. Instead, optimally delegating a share of decisions to physicians, where they possess private diagnostic information, effectively utilizes the complementarity between algorithmic and human decisions. Combining physician and algorithmic decisions can achieve a reduction in inefficient overprescribing of antibiotics by 20.3 percent.","Ribers, MA; Ullrich, H",Out of scope,10.1007/s11129-024-09284-1,Human-machine complementarity; Machine learning; Antibiotic resistance; Antibiotic prescribing; C53; D83; I18; I19; L2; M15,0.0,,0,100,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare, specifically in antibiotic prescribing, which is not related to marketing.",wos-artificial intelligence,0,0,Complementarities between algorithmic and human decision-making: The case of antibiotic prescribing,2024

"This study empirically investigates two effects of alternative data availability: stock price informativeness and its disciplining effect on managers' actions. Recent computing advancements have enabled technology companies to collect real-time, granular indicators of fundamentals to sell to investment professionals. These data include consumer transactions and satellite images. The introduction of these data increases price informativeness through decreased information acquisition costs, particularly in firms in which sophisticated investors have higher incentives to uncover information. I document two effects on managers. First, managers reduce their opportunistic trading. Second, investment efficiency increases, consistent with price informativeness improving managers' incentives to invest and divest efficiently.

The theoretical framework for designing software called Hypertension Management System (HMS) is proposed using underlying principles of game theory by considering patients and doctors as players. The system is installed in the smartphones of players and its functioning follows the hierarchy of Big Data mining and extraction. The theoretical framework of HMS starts from data sensing through physical sensors, proceeds along layers for data processing and reduction, and finally arrives at the decision-making step to assist doctors in the treatment of disease.

"Social network (SN) platforms have become ubiquitous in most countries. However, the reliability of the in-formation shared and the structural mechanisms that govern the discussions is constantly being questioned. There is a need for understanding the mechanism for information dissemination and developing decision aids that can help decipher information validity. Our context is the support provided within the mental health community where the diseases are typically chronic and the need for social and medical support is obvious. We employ an analytics approach in the context of social capital theory (SCT) to study the relationship between the structural makeup (i.e., influence) of a user and the characteristics of the knowledge disseminated on a microblogging platform. Different types of information provide various types of support to patients.

"Loyal patients can bring substantial benefits to a hospital. Service quality of a hospital was one of the driving forces to patients' satisfaction and loyalty, but it was a necessary but not a sufficient factor. Recent studies in consumer behavior had proven that the perceived value was the primary determinant of loyal behavior for services. This research focused on identifying the patients' perceived values toward hospitals. To capture with more confidence the misty inner of the patients' value perception, this study adopted the fuzzy logic, a method that had been develop to reflect the fuzzy nature of human mind. Being the first in adopting a fuzzy logic in this context, this research find quality of care and physician competence were the top two value aspects perceived by patients. This was consistent with previous studies, yet some new insights were further revealed. This study used a closeness index to distinguish the best hospital that was otherwise assessed by other methods as similar to the rivalries. Results also indicated that the hospital with superior operation performance was the one received better levels of patients' perceived value. The research brought several managerial implications, particularly in the needs of identifying and correcting marketing myopia.","Pan, FFC",Out of scope,,Health service; fuzzy sets; perceived value; marketing; competition,0.0,,0,100,ACADEMIC JOURNALS,"The abstract discusses patient loyalty and perceived value in the context of hospitals, which is not related to marketing but rather healthcare services.",wos-fuzzy logic,0,0,Perceived values on hospital services: A fuzzy logic application,2011

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate segmentations by finance-related attitudes and behavior of financial consumers in Switzerland and Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach - The authors replicated the questionnaire measuring attitudes toward financial affairs as used in the study of Funfgeld and Wang (2009). In order to extract factors and identify profiles of financial customers, the authors applied the same techniques including factor analysis and a two-step cluster analysis (Ward and K-means) to both samples. Linear regressions were used to examine the impact of socio-demographic variables. Findings - Factor analysis reveals surprisingly similar underlying dimensions of financial attitudes and behavior for participants in both countries. The five clusters based on these dimensions exhibit strikingly similar characteristics. The authors also find that socio-demographic variables such as gender, age and education significantly vary across groups. Research limitations/implications - There are small differences in the composition of the revealed dimensions between the two countries, mainly a mixture of intuitive decisions and free-spending aspects. Future research may investigate more countries with comparable samples to further test the reliabilities and validities of the scales. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the instruments as developed by Funfgeld and Wang (2009) can be used not only in highly developedWestern markets but also in non-Western and emerging markets. Such instruments can be very useful for offering financial advice based on market segmentation in a global market. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence on universal segmentation variables that reflect financial consumers' psychological traits and attitudes toward saving and spending. Furthermore, the study stresses the need for a broad use of those variables when studying consumer decision-making in international financial markets.","Phan, TC; Rieger, MO; Wang, M",Out of scope,10.1108/IJBM-07-2017-0141,Personal finance; Cross-national clusters; Financial advice; Universal segmentation variables,0.0,,5,80,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on the financial consumer behavior and attitudes in Switzerland and Vietnam, which aligns with financial services but does not directly relate to marketing strategies or tactics.",wos-k-means,10,5,Segmentation of financial clients by attitudes and behavior A comparison between Switzerland and Vietnam,2019
"Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection, effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis, and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10-20 (13-24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients' demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%-96% or $1.6 million to $2 million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff to the health care system.","Chen, YX; Lee, JY; Sridhar, S; Mittal, V; McCallister, K; Singal, AG",Out of scope,10.1177/0022242920913025,causal forests; machine learning; personalized health care marketing; cancer screening; randomized field experiment,,0.0,0,100,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses healthcare-related outreach marketing efforts to improve liver cancer screening, which does not align with marketing-focused AI applications.",wos-machine learning,0,0,Improving Cancer Outreach Effectiveness Through Targeting and Economic Assessments: Insights from a Randomized Field Experiment,2020

At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis.FindingsResults from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked.Research limitations/implicationsThis study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field.Originality/valueThe paper provides a discussion about ways domains of trust and specific variables can be utilized to address the persistent problem of financial exclusion in the United States.

"Social media platforms for healthcare services are changing how patients choose physicians. The digitization of healthcare reviews has been providing additional information to patients when choosing their physicians. On the other hand, the growing online information introduces more uncertainty among providers regarding the expected future demand and how different service features can affect patient decisions. In this paper, we derive various service-quality proxies from online reviews and show that leveraging textual information can derive useful operational measures to better understand patient choices. To do so, we study a unique data set from one of the leading appointment-booking websites in the United States. We derive from the text reviews the seven most frequently mentioned topics among patients, namely, bedside manner, diagnosis accuracy, waiting time, service time, insurance process, physician knowledge, and office environment, and then incorporate these service features into a random-coefficient choice model to quantify the economic values of these service-quality proxies. By introducing quality proxies from text reviews, we find the predictive power of patient choice increases significantly, for example, a 6%-1.2% improvement measured by mean squared error for both in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, our estimation results indicate that contextual description may better characterize users' perceived quality than numerical ratings on the same service feature. Broadly speaking, this paper shows how to incorporate textual information into an econometric model to understand patient choice in healthcare delivery. Our interdisciplinary approach provides a framework that combines machine learning and structural modeling techniques to advance the literature in empirical operations management, information systems, and marketing.","Xu, YQ; Armony, M; Ghose, A",Out of scope,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3879,physician; patient choice; quality; social media; text mining; sentiment; rating; review; service quality; healthcare,0.0,,0,100,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses healthcare services and patient choices, which are not related to marketing as defined.

"Accurate prediction of stock market values is a challenging task for over decades. Prediction of stock prices is associated with numerous benefits including but not limited to helping investors make wise decisions to accumulate profits. The development of the share price is a dynamic and nonlinear process affected by several factors. What is interesting is the unpredictability of share prices due to the global financial crisis. However, classical methods are no longer sufficient for the application of share price development prediction. However, over-relying on prediction data can lead to losses in the case of software malfunction. This paper aims to innovate the prediction management when predicting the share price development over time by the use of neural networks. For the contribution, the data on the prices of CEZ, a.s. shares obtained from the Prague Stock Exchange database. The stock price data are available for the period 2012-2017. In the case of Statistica software, the multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) and the radial basis function networks (RBF) are generated. Inthe case of Matlab software, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) are generated. The networks with the best characteristics are retained and based on the statistical interpretation of the results, and all are applicable in practice. In all data sets, MLP networks show stable performance better than in the case of SVR and BPNN networks. As for the final assessment, the deviation of 2.26% occurs in the most significant differential of the maximal and the minimal prediction. It is not necessarily significant regarding the price of one stock. However, in the case of purchasing or selling a large number of stocks, the difference may seem significant. Therefore, in practice, the application of two networks is recommended: MLP 1-2-1 and MLP 1-5-1. The first network always represents a pessimistic, minimal prediction. The second one of the recommended networks is an optimistic, maximal prediction. The actual situation should correspond to the interval of the difference between the optimistic and pessimistic prediction.","Vochozka, M; Horak, J; Krulicky, T",Out of scope,10.21272/mmi.2020.2-24,Statistica software; Matlab software; stock price development; neural networks; prediction,0.0,,5,85,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MIA","The content focuses on stock market prediction, which is categorized as not related to marketing applications.",wos-neural network,5,5,INNOVATIONS IN MANAGEMENT FORECAST: TIME DEVELOPMENT OF STOCK PRICES WITH NEURAL NETWORKS,2020
"Behavioral biases are known to influence the investment decisions of retail investors. Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic.","Talwar, S; Talwar, M; Tarjanne, V; Dhir, A",Out of scope,10.1002/mar.21550,artificial neural network (ANN); behavioral biases; behavioral finance; heuristic simplification; retail investors,0.0,,5,85,WILEY,"The abstract discusses behavioral biases influencing investment decisions of millennials, particularly during a health crisis, which falls under financial services rather than marketing.",wos-neural network,5,5,Why retail investors traded equity during the pandemic?

"Recent increase in peer-to-peer lending prompted for development of models to separate good and bad clients to mitigate risks both for lenders and for the platforms. The rapidly increasing body of literature provides several comparisons between various models. Among the most frequently employed ones are logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, neural networks and decision tree-based models. Among them, logistic regression has proved to be a strong candidate both because its good performance and due to its high explainability. The present paper aims to compare four pairs of models (for imbalanced and under-sampled data) meant to predict charged off clients by optimizing F1 score. We found that, if the data is balanced, Logistic Regression, both simple and with Stochastic Gradient Descent, outperforms LightGBM and K-Nearest Neighbors in optimizing F1 score. We chose this metric as it provides balance between the interests of the lenders and those of the platform. Loan term, debt-toincome ratio and number of accounts were found to be important positively related predictors of risk of charge off. At the other end of the spectrum, by far the strongest impact on charge off probability is that of the FICO score. The final number of features retained by the two models differs very much, because, although both models use Lasso for feature selection, Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic Regression uses a stronger regularization. The analysis was performed using Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn and imblearn).","Caplescu, RD; Panaite, AM; Pele, DT; Strat, VA",Out of scope,10.2478/mmcks-2020-0023,peer-to-peer lending; creditworthiness; Logistic Regression; KNN; LightGBM,0.0,,0,100,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses models for predicting credit risk in peer-to-peer lending, which falls under financial services rather than marketing.",wos-neural network,0,0,Will they repay their debt?

"Since the first bankruptcy prediction models developed in the 60th of 20th century numerous different models have been constructed through the world. These individual models for bankruptcy prediction have been created in different time and space using different methods and variables. During this period various statistical methods have been used starting with the most popular univariate, linear and multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, probit regression, decision trees, neural networks, rough sets, linear programming, principal component analysis, data envelopment analysis, survival analysis and so on. Therefore, we aim to provide deep insight and analyse the bankruptcy prediction models developed in countries of Visegrad four, with the emphasis on methods applied and explanatory variables used in these models, and evaluate them through appropriate statistical methods. Specifically, cluster analysis to explore the differences between basic groups of financial indicators and designed clusters of explanatory variables. Based on the analysis of more than one hundred bankruptcy prediction models we can conclude the most used variables, which serves as a basis for further research and development of prediction models in Visegrad group countries. Three clusters were developed which representing various explanatory variables while these clusters differ from basic groups of financial indicators. According to detected clusters we recommend to choose the most frequently used variables from each created cluster.

"Market analyzers use different parameters as features in the market data to analyze the market trends. The feature's values act as a signal to market fluctuations. Many studies have examined these features to predict market movement more effectively. However, the method to minimize the uncertainties associated with the features is not available in the literature. This exploratory study introduces the uncertainty optimization based feature selection method for stock marketing. We introduce a notion of certainty region of the feature as the set of feature values, which signify particular happening with certainty. We use rough set theory to find the feature's certainty region and uncertainty region and measure each feature's significance. The feature whose certainty region is the maximum is the most significant in the feature space. Hence we group the features by minimizing the uncertainty region of the most informative features to get feature subsets for feature selection. We propose an algorithm based on uncertainty optimization to find subsets of the feature set for effectiveness and performance enhancement in the feature selection. We obtain the decision rules with comprehensive coverage and excellent support using the selected features. The accuracy of classification using the chosen parameters is up to 85.91%, which is higher than 79.54% of the complete feature set. The study provides an uncertainty optimization model for more efficient market movement prediction.","Sinha, AK; Shende, P",Out of scope,10.1007/s10614-022-10344-5,Stock market; Uncertainty optimization; Rough set; Feature selection; Optimization algorithm,0.0,,0,100,SPRINGER,"The abstract primarily discusses an uncertainty optimization model for stock market prediction, which is outside the marketing context as defined in the provided classifications.",wos-prediction,0,0,Uncertainty Optimization Based Feature Selection Model for Stock Marketing,2024

"Following the enforcement of the EEC Directive (1989), focused on the promotion of workers health and safety, several approaches have been developed in the last 30 years to assess the risks related to the different hazards in the work environment and to identify, based on this assessment process, measures and action to promote safety and to reduce the occupational accidents. These approaches generally are focused on the analysis of the working activity and neglect the influence of the worker characteristics involved, strongly limiting the effectiveness of the risk-based decision making. This has a particular relevance in manufacturing field, where workers are still widely employed in several tasks, despite an increasing processes automation. Within this paper an innovative approach to explicitly consider the individual characteristic of the workers within the risk assessment in the work environment is described. Integration of a Human Performance model within risk assessment process is thus proposed. The resulting method allowed the definition of a customized risk based both on the individual skill of the worker involved and on the characteristics of the work places The comparison between risk assessed with traditional method and the customized risk showed the relevant influence that the human performance may have on the risk level to which the workers are exposed to and consequently allowed the company to identify the need for technical and organisational prevention and protection measures not highlighted with the more traditional approach. This method was applied for validation to an assembly line of a heavy vehicles manufacturing plant. The impact on the risk assessment is here shown and discussed, while the results in terms of safety at the workplace are still in the phase of data collection and will be published in future work. This model represents a step into the future of safety as a precursor of a more general process of customization at the individual level that is ongoing in several branches from the precision and personalized medicine (Duarte and Spencer, 2016) to the individual financial and marketing methods (Matz and Netzer, 2017). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Comberti L.; Demichela M.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105809,Customized Risk; Human performance; Occupational safety management,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses risk assessment in occupational health and safety, particularly in manufacturing, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-automation,0,0,Customised risk assessment in manufacturing: A step towards the future of occupational safety management,2022
"For more than a decade, it has been observed that due to the continuously increasing elderly population, medical expenditures for home health-care have rapidly increased every year. Health-care organizations are being encouraged to find more efficient methods of providing high-quality care with cost savings. Elderly people who live alone may fear being unable to obtain help if they are injured or ill. For many families, the fear of such an event can dominate decisions about living arrangements. During the last decades, this fear has generated an industry, marketing house automations, alarm-and-notification systems as well as assistive technologies and interventions that aim at easier and more efficient control of their living environment, as well as the provision of specialized home-care services. In this study, the most important aspects of the INHOME platform architecture, the home-care services provided together with the home-care applications developed such as health monitoring and household appliances monitoring and control, are discussed. The goal of the INHOME project is to provide ambient assistive living services to improve the quality of life of elderly people at home and is mainly targeted at ameliorating the ways of providing intelligent services for assisting independent living of elderly people at home. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",Vergados D.D.,Out of scope,10.1007/s00779-009-0278-8,AAL; Assisted living at home; Elderly people; Health-care services; Home-care; Networked home,0.0,,0,100,,"The abstract discusses healthcare technologies and home-care services for the elderly, which are not related to marketing applications.",scopus-automation,0,0,Service personalization for assistive living in a mobile ambient healthcare-networked environment,2010
"Broad genome-wide testing is increasingly finding its way to the public through the online direct-to-consumer marketing of so-called personal genome tests. Personal genome tests estimate genetic susceptibilities to multiple diseases and other phenotypic traits simultaneously. Providers commonly make use of Terms of Service agreements rather than informed consent procedures. However, to protect consumers from the potential physical, psychological and social harms associated with personal genome testing and to promote autonomous decision-making with regard to the testing offer, we argue that current practices of information provision are insufficient and that there is a place - and a need - for informed consent in personal genome testing, also when it is offered commercially. The increasing quantity, complexity and diversity of most testing offers, however, pose challenges for information provision and informed consent. Both specific and generic models for informed consent fail to meet its moral aims when applied to personal genome testing. Consumers should be enabled to know the limitations, risks and implications of personal genome testing and should be given control over the genetic information they do or do not wish to obtain. We present the outline of a new model for informed consent which can meet both the norm of providing sufficient information and the norm of providing understandable information. The model can be used for personal genome testing, but will also be applicable to other, future forms of broad genetic testing or screening in commercial and clinical settings. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bunnik E.M.; Janssens A.C.J.W.; Schermer M.H.N.,Out of scope,10.1111/bioe.12004,Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer; Generic consent; Genetic testing; Informed consent; Personal genome testing; Specific consent,,0.0,0,100,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,"The abstract discusses personal genome testing and informed consent in a healthcare context, which does not relate to marketing.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,Informed consent in direct-to-consumer personal genome testing: The outline of a model between specific and generic consent,2014
"In the paper, a descriptive model of system dynamics for binary data is presented. Binary or dichotomous data are widely spread across various fields of research - in decision making and data mining, marketing, solving of many natural, social and technical problems. The initial data for building the model is a set of states of an autonomous dynamical system with components taking binary values. At the same time, the time order of the states is permissible. The following objectives were stated: to identify the relationships between the components of the system defining its dynamics; on the basis of the identified dynamics, to recover the true order of the system states; to apply the developed model to the problem of visual identification of cyanobacteria in water areas using digital photography. To solve the problem, we used a mathematical model that enables to describe the relationships between components and transitions between the system states at a simple-forunderstanding level. The principle of parsimony underlies the model. According to this principle, the most appropriate model is described by the simplest relations in the sense defined in the work. As the case study, the problem of recognizing clumps of cyanobacteria from digital satellite imagery was considered. This is a complex, practically important problem that does not have a satisfactory experimental and theoretical solution at the moment. Applying system approaches to the measured colorimetric parameters of digital photography, we developed the index for identification of such clumps. This index uses the parameters of the digital RGB model of (various parts of) an image and allows us to reveal clumps of cyanobacteria on digital images obtained by aerospace methods. Additionally, digital photography can be performed in the conditions of insufficient visibility (due to precipitation, fog, and other factors), for imitation of which in the case study the original image was distorted by the digital noise. The studied model can find useful applications in the areas requiring binary dynamical data insights. © K. Nosov, G. Zholtkevych, M. Georgiyants, O. Vysotska, Y. Balym, A.

"The advent of new genetic and genomic technologies may cause friction with the principle of respect for autonomy and demands a rethinking of traditional interpretations of the concept of informed consent. Technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and micro-array based analysis enable genome-wide testing for many heterogeneous abnormalities and predispositions simultaneously. This may challenge the feasibility of providing adequate pre-test information and achieving autonomous decision-making. At a symposium held at the 11th World Congress of Bioethics in June 2012 (Rotterdam), organized by the International Association of Bioethics, these challenges were presented for three different areas in which these so-called 'new genetics' technologies are increasingly being applied: newborn screening, prenatal screening strategies and commercial personal genome testing. In this article, we build upon the existing ethical framework for a responsible set-up of testing and screening offers and reinterpret some of its criteria in the light of the new genetics. As we will argue, the scope of a responsible testing or screening offer should align with the purpose(s) of testing and with the principle of respect for autonomy for all stakeholders involved, including (future) children. Informed consent is a prerequisite but requires a new approach. We present preliminary and general directions for an individualized or differentiated set-up of the testing offer and for the informed consent process. With this article we wish to contribute to the formation of new ideas on how to tackle the issues of autonomy and informed consent for (public) healthcare and direct-to-consumer applications of the new genetics. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bunnik E.M.; de Jong A.; Nijsingh N.; de Wert G.M.W.R.,Out of scope,10.1111/bioe.12030,Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer genetic testing; Informed consent; Neonatal screening; New genetics; Personal genome testing; Prenatal screening,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses ethical implications of genetic technologies and informed consent in healthcare, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,The new genetics and informed consent: Differentiating choice to preserve autonomy,2013
"This Point/Counterpoint article discusses the transformation of dental practice from the traditional solo/small-group (partnership) model of the 1900s to large Dental Support Organizations (DSO) that support affiliated dental practices by providing nonclinical functions such as, but not limited to, accounting, human resources, marketing, and legal and practice management. Many feel that DSO-managed group practices (DMGPs) with employed providers will become the setting in which the majority of oral health care will be delivered in the future. Viewpoint 1 asserts that the traditional dental practice patterns of the past are shifting as many younger dentists gravitate toward employed positions in large group practices or the public sector. Although educational debt is relevant in predicting graduates’ practice choices, other variables such as gender, race, and work-life balance play critical roles as well. Societal characteristics demonstrated by aging Gen Xers and those in the Millennial generation blend seamlessly with the opportunities DMGPs offer their employees. Viewpoint 2 contends the traditional model of dental care delivery—allowing entrepreneurial practitioners to make decisions in an autonomous setting—is changing but not to the degree nor as rapidly as Viewpoint 1 professes. Millennials entering the dental profession, with characteristics universally attributed to their generation, see value in the independence and flexibility that a traditional practice allows. Although DMGPs provide dentists one option for practice, several alternative delivery models offer current dentists and future dental school graduates many of the advantages of DMGPs while allowing them to maintain the independence and freedom a traditional practice provides. © American Dental Education Association","Cole J.R.; Dodge W.W.; Findley J.S.; Young S.K.; Horn B.D.; Kalkwarf K.L.; Martin M.M., Jr.; Winder R.L.",Out of scope,10.1002/j.0022-0337.2015.79.5.tb05905.x,dental group practice; dentists; ownership; practice management; private practice; professional autonomy; professional practice location,,0.0,0,100,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,"The abstract discusses changes in dental practice models and the implications for the profession, which are not related to marketing strategies or decisions.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,Will Large DSO-Managed Group Practices Be the Predominant Setting for Oral Health Care by 2025?

"Background High budget impact (BI) estimates of new drugs have led to decision-making challenges potentially resulting in restrictions in patient access. However, current BI predictions are rather inaccurate and short term. We therefore developed a new approach for BI prediction. Here, we describe the validation of our BI prediction approach using oncology drugs as a case study. Methods We used Dutch population-level data to estimate BI where BI is defined as list price multiplied by volume. We included drugs in the antineoplastic agents ATC category which the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered a New Active Substance and received EMA marketing authorization (MA) between 2000 and 2017. A mixed-effects model was used for prediction and included tumor site, orphan, first in class or conditional approval designation as covariates. Data from 2000 to 2012 were the training set. BI was predicted monthly from 0 to 45 months after MA. Cross-validation was performed using a rolling forecasting origin with e<^>|Ln(observed BI/predicted BI)| as outcome. Results The training set and validation set included 25 and 44 products, respectively. Mean error, composed of all validation outcomes, was 2.94 (median 1.57). Errors are higher with less available data and at more future predictions. Highest errors occur without any prior data. From 10 months onward, error remains constant. Conclusions The validation shows that the method can relatively accurately predict BI. For payers or policymakers, this approach can yield a valuable addition to current BI predictions due to its ease of use, independence of indications and ability to update predictions to the most recent data.","Geenen, JW; Belitser, SV; Vreman, RA; van Bloois, M; Klungel, OH; Boersma, C; Hövels, AM",Out of scope,10.1007/s10198-020-01176-x,Budget impact; Oncology; Medicines; Budget impact estimation; Prediction modeling; Validation study,0.0,,5,85,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a new approach for predicting budget impact (BI) of oncology drugs, which is primarily a healthcare-related topic rather than a marketing-focused application.",wos-prediction,5,5,A novel method for predicting the budget impact of innovative medicines: validation study for oncolytics,2020
"Consumers incorrectly rely on their sense of understanding of what a company does to evaluate investment risk. In three correlational studies, greater sense of understanding was associated with lower risk ratings (Study 1) and with prediction distributions of future stock performance that had lower standard deviations and higher means (Studies 2 and 3). In all studies, sense of understanding was unassociated with objective risk measures. Risk perceptions increased when the authors degraded sense of understanding by presenting company information in an unstructured versus structured format (Study 4). Sense of understanding also influenced downstream investment decisions. In a portfolio construction task, both novices and seasoned investors allocated more money to hard-to-understand companies for a risk-tolerant client relative to a risk-averse one (Study 5).

"This research examines the behavioral consequences of HIV testing by focusing on whether and how members of a large, increasingly at-risk group (heterosexual young adults) alter their willingness to engage in risky sexual behavior on the basis of their awareness of their own and their potential partners' HIV risk status. In particular, this research draws on an expected-utility model of risky sexual behavior to test its basic prediction that in certain conditions, changes in risk perceptions induced by HIV testing can result in an increase in risky sexual behavior. The results of two experimental studies using projective scenarios provide general support for the predictions that stem from the expected-utility model, particularly in conditions of low infection likelihood. Moreover, accounting for decision makers' altruistic impulses in the risky-sex context enhances the descriptive validity of the economic model of risky sexual behavior.","Sen, S",Out of scope,10.1509/jppm.23.1.28.30405,,,0.0,0,100,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses behavioral consequences of HIV testing and risky sexual behavior, which falls under healthcare and not marketing-related applications.",wos-prediction,0,0,The behavioral consequences of HIV testing: An experimental investigation,2004
"Consumer use of social media has witnessed significant growth in recent years. Due to its unregulated, user-generated, and poorly censored format, social media use has blurred the line between the fake and the true and can result in mass dissemination of inaccurate and false information, thereby impacting national politics, election outcomes, and social interactions between consumer social clusters. In the unique context of financial decisions, consumer reliance on social media can significantly increase the risk of making poor financial decisions. This study examined the impact of cognitive style, consumer gullibility, and demographics on consumers' reliance on social media for financial decision making. The results of a US national survey identify consumer characteristics which contribute to increased reliance on social media in financial decision making.

"Couples that include an addict establish over time a stable pattern of deviant behavior that is reciprocally influenced by each spouse's level of drug use. Adequate intervention strategies must understand this dynamic in order to promote successful change. This article describes how behavioral patterns of narcotics addicts are affected by their spouses' addictive consumption of drugs. Analyses are conducted for men and women separately to explore gender differences with the use of retrospective self-report data on addiction histories collected from over 600 addicts who were admitted to methadone maintenance clinics in Southern California. Time-series analyses are conducted at the aggregate level to examine dynamic relationships between self's and spouse's narcotics use and other behaviors (e.g., employment, crime involvement, and alcohol use). Results indicate gender differences in conformity to spouse's drug use, especially for women, and in the effects of addiction on the related behaviors.

"Purpose This study examines the effect of a regulatory-focused prime (i.e. a brochure with a picture and message) on the recommending behavior of investment advisers in the context of an investment decision. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were conducted with 468 participants, mostly from the financial services industry. Study 1 examined the direct effect of a regulatory-focused prime on an investment adviser's recommending behavior, whereas Study 2 examined the moderating role of regulatory fit on such behavior. Study 3 validated the findings. Findings The results provide evidence that a message using visual and textual cues based on a promotion and prevention regulatory focus may trigger a preference in an investment adviser's product recommendation. A promotion (prevention)-focused framed message will trigger the recommendation of an investment plan with a higher but riskier (safe and stable) potential return. However, when the same prime is presented with details of a performance incentive scheme, the effect of the prime is reduced when there is a regulatory nonfit between the prime and the message relating to the performance incentive scheme. Practical implications The findings highlight the importance of understanding how regulatory-focused stimuli may subconsciously influence the recommendation of investment advisers as heuristics used in decision-making, thereby influencing their clients' investment decisions. Originality/value Past studies have focused on how regulatory-focused visual and message cues influence consumer decision-making. This study provides empirical evidence regarding the influence of regulatory-focused prime on an investment adviser's behavior when providing investment advice.","Ewe, SY; Lee, CKC; Gul, FA",Out of scope,10.1108/IJBM-12-2019-0452,Regulatory focus; Recommending behavior; Visual cue; Performance incentive,0.0,,0,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on the behavior of investment advisers in the context of financial services, which is not directly related to marketing as defined.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and related rise of public distrust has called personal autonomy in health messaging into question, drawing attention to two competing forms of health messaging—communicating to persuade versus to inform. Communicating to persuade utilizes marketing techniques to promote behavior change whereas communicating to inform focuses on providing information to facilitate informed decision-making. Communicating to inform is supported by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that autonomy, coupled with competence and relatedness, is a basic psychological need, relevant to making health-decisions and maintaining behavior change. This study aims to assess the above mentioned dynamics of SDT in health messaging through the development of an autonomous scale and assessment criteria. The purpose of the scale is to guide the development of health messaging that aims to communicate to inform (autonomy-enhancing) rather than communicating to persuade or coerce the audience into adopting a specific health behavior (autonomy-diminishing). The results of the study suggest that individual perception of autonomy in health messaging is influenced by a variety of factors. As such, the criteria outlined in this scale can be used as a guide to develop health messaging that purposefully integrates and supports autonomy-enhancing principles.

"This study addresses the ubiquitous challenge of using big observational data to identify heterogeneous treatment effects. This problem arises in precision medicine, targeted marketing, personalized education, and many other environments. Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects presents several analytical challenges including high dimensionality and endogeneity issues. We develop a new instrumental variable tree (IVT) approach that incorporates the instrumental variable method into a causal tree (CT) to correct for potential endogeneity biases that may exist in observational data. Our IVT approach partitions subjects into subgroups with similar treatment effects within subgroups and different treatment effects across subgroups. The estimated treatment effects are asymptotically consistent under a set of mild assumptions. Using simulated data, we show our approach has a better coverage rate and smaller mean-squared error than the conventional CT approach. We also demonstrate that an instrumental variable forest (IVF) constructed using IVTs has better accuracy and stratification than a generalized random forest. Finally, by applying the IVF approach to an empirical assessment of laparoscopic colectomy, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity to make accurate comparisons of the heterogeneous effects of the treatment (teaching hospitals) and control (nonteaching hospitals) on different types of patients.

"Big data has become a significant research area due to the birth of enormous data generated from various sources like social media, internet of things and multimedia applications. Big data has played critical role in many decision makings and forecasting domains such as recommendation systems, business analysis, healthcare, web display advertising, clinicians, transportation, fraud detection and tourism marketing. The rapid development of various big data tools such as Hadoop, Storm, Spark, Flink, Kafka and Pig in research and industrial communities has allowed the huge number of data to be distributed, communicated and processed. Big data applications use big data analytics techniques to efficiently analyze large amounts of data. However, choosing the suitable big data tools based on batch and stream data processing and analytics techniques for development a big data system are difficult due to the challenges in processing and applying big data. Practitioners and researchers who are developing big data systems have inadequate information about the current technology and requirement concerning the big data platform.

"We studied the impact of data aggregation on the performance of logistic regression on predicting the direction of the Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA) stock market index. Data aggregation is a common operation in business, science, engineering, medicine, etc.; it is performed for purposes such as statistical, financial, and sales and marketing analysis - particularly within the context of a data warehouse. We showed experimentally that, for this example, as long as aggregation does not shrink the sample size unduly, it does not significantly impair the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting the direction of the DJIA stock market index. We also observed that aggregation-based models are simpler (less over-parameterized) than detail-based models. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the robustness of such predictive models. Specifically, we used the area under the ROC curve as a summary measure of the overall performance of a given model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"Dividend is the return that an investor receives when purchasing a company's shares. The decision to pay these dividends to shareholders concerns several other groups of people, such as financial managers, consulting firms, individual and institutional investors, government and monitoring authorities, and creditors, just to name a few. The prediction and modelling of this decision has received a significant amount of attention in the corporate finance literature. However, the methods used to study the aforementioned question are limited to the logistic regression method without any implementation of the advanced and expert methods of data mining. These methods have proven their superiority in other business-related fields, such as marketing, production, accounting and auditing. In finance, bankruptcy prediction has the vast majority among data-mining implementations, but to the best of the authors’ knowledge such an implementation does not exist in dividend payment prediction. This paper satisfies this gap in the literature and provides answers that help to understand the so-called ‘dividend puzzle’. Specifically, this paper provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that data-mining methods perform better in accuracy measures against the traditional methods used. The prediction of dividend policy determinants provides valuable benefits to all related parties, as they can manage, invest, consult and monitor the dividend policy in a more effective way.

"Purpose: This paper aims to provide an example of how to use data mining techniques to identify patient segments regarding preferences for healthcare attributes and their demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Data were derived from a number of individuals who received in-patient care at a health network in 2006. Data mining and conventional hierarchical clustering with average linkage and Pearson correlation procedures are employed and compared to show how each procedure best determines segmentation variables. Findings: Data mining tools identified three differentiable segments by means of cluster analysis. These three clusters have significantly different demographic profiles. Practical implications: The study reveals, when compared with traditional statistical methods, that data mining provides an efficient and effective tool for market segmentation. When there are numerous cluster variables involved, researchers and practitioners need to incorporate factor analysis for reducing variables to clearly and meaningfully understand clusters. Originality/value: Interests and applications in data mining are increasing in many businesses. However, this technology is seldom applied to healthcare customer experience management.

"Background: The rapid diffusion of technology apps may support older adults’ independence and improve the quality of their lives. Models for predicting technology acceptance in older adults are sparse, based on broad questions related to general technology acceptance, and largely not grounded in theories of aging. Objective: This study aimed to use a mixed methods approach involving 5 technologies to comprehensively assess the causal relationships among factors that influence older adults’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Methods: In total, 187 men and women aged 65 to 92 years participated in the study. Participants were given presentations on 5 different technologies spanning domains that included transportation, leisure, health, and new learning and provided ratings of each technology on various measures hypothesized to influence adoption. They were also administered other instruments to collect data on their actual and self-assessed cognitive abilities, rates of discounting of the technologies with respect to willingness to invest time to attain higher skills in the technologies, general technology experience, and attitudes toward technology. We used the machine learning technique of k-fold cross-validated regressions to select variables that predicted participants’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Results: Willingness to adopt technologies was most impacted by 3 variables: perceived value of the technologies (β=.54), perceived improvement in quality of life attainable from the technologies (β=.24), and confidence in being able to use the technologies (β=.15). These variables, in turn, were mostly facilitated or inhibited by the perceived effort required to learn to use the technologies, a positive attitude toward technology as reflected in the optimism component of the technology readiness scale, the degree to which technologies were discounted, and the perceived help needed to learn to use the technologies. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that participants’ willingness to adopt technologies is mainly determined by perceptions of 3 aspects of the technologies; these aspects possibly mediate many relationships with willingness to adopt. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design and marketing of technology products for older consumers. ©Jerad Moxley, Joseph Sharit, Sara J Czaja.",Moxley J.; Sharit J.; Czaja S.J.,Out of scope,10.2196/39890,adopt; adoption; aging; application; cognition; cognitive; consumer; design; design; health; independence; learning; leisure; marketing; mobile phone; older adult; relationship; technology; technology; transportation; willingness,0.0,,0,100,JMIR Publications Inc.,"The study focuses on the adoption of technology by older adults, which does not relate to marketing or the marketing applications of AI.",scopus-machine learning,0,0,The Factors Influencing Older Adults’ Decisions Surrounding Adoption of Technology: Quantitative Experimental Study,2022
"The appropriate management of home medical waste is of paramount importance due to the adverse consequences that arise from improper handling. Incorrect disposal practices can lead to pharmacopollution, which poses significant risks to environmental integrity and human well-being. Involving medicine users in waste management empowers them to take responsibility for their waste and make informed decisions to safeguard the environment and public health. The objective of this research was to contribute to the prevention of pharmacopollution by identifying influential factors that promote responsible disposal practices among medicine users. Factors such as attitude, marketing campaigns, collection points, safe handling, medical prescription, package contents, and public policies and laws were examined. To analyze the complex relationships and interactions among these factors, a dual-staged approach was employed, utilizing advanced statistical modeling techniques and deep learning artificial neural network algorithms. Data were collected from 952 respondents in Pernambuco, a state in northeastern Brazil known for high rates of pharmacopollution resulting from improper disposal of household medical waste. The results of the study indicated that the propositions related to safety in handling and medical prescription were statistically rejected in the structural equation modeling (SEM) model. However, in the artificial neural network (ANN) model, these two propositions were found to be important predictors of cooperative behavior, highlighting the ANN’s ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between variables. The findings emphasize the significance of user cooperation and provide insights for the development of effective strategies and policies to address pharmacopollution. © 2023 by the authors.",Silva W.D.O.; Morais D.C.; da Silva K.G.; Carmona Marques P.,Out of scope,10.3390/su151410898,artificial neural network; consumer behavior; deep learning; home waste medicine; pharmacopollution; structural equation modeling,,0.0,0,100,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses the management of home medical waste, focusing on environmental and public health issues related to pharmacopollution.

"Crop type classification is an essential task in agriculture that has been studied widely since the emergence of remote sensing technologies. Accurate crop mapping can help assist decision-making related to storage, marketing, and other production tasks. This study has designed robust crop classification models to classify two major crop types (cereals and canola) in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. These models combined Sentinel 1 and 2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Three methods were applied to test classification quality: the holdout method, leave-one-season-out cross-validation (LOSOCV), and leave-one-cluster-out-cross-validation (LOCOCV). The holdout method evaluated the model's performance on data representing the entire population. The LOSOCV method was used to test the model's ability to extrapolate over time (unseen data from new seasons), and the LOCOCV method was used to test the ability to extrapolate over space (data from a new site). Crop type labelled data (n = 193 for cereals and n = 113 for canola) were extracted from high-resolution yield maps derived from grain yield monitors mounted on harvesters, and this was used to train and validate the classification models. The results showed that the holdout validation approach achieved the highest accuracy (overall and Kappa scores >0.98), but this might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the sampling strategy implemented, which leads to an overoptimistic scenario. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores achieved from the LOSOCV method varied depending upon the difference in crop phenology from season to season, with overall accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 0.92 and Kappa scores from 0.61 to 0.90. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores for the LOCOCV ranged from 0.87 to 0.99 and 0.84 to 0.98, respectively. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and the chlorophyll red edge index (CIr) were the most important features across the three models. The outputs of this research can potentially complement models that require crop type information, such as carbon cycling and crop yield models. © 2024 The Authors",Al-Shammari D.; Fuentes I.; Whelan B.M.; Wang C.; Filippi P.; Bishop T.F.A.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101200,Gross primary productivity; Machine learning; Optical remote sensing; Radar; Yield monitor data,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses crop type classification using remote sensing technologies in agriculture, which does not relate to marketing or business strategy.",scopus-machine learning,0,0,"Combining Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 and MODIS data for major winter crop type classification over the Murray Darling Basin in Australia",2024
"Optimal stopping is the problem of deciding when to stop a stochastic system to obtain the greatest reward, arising in numerous application areas such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy’s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Poor’s 500 Index data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art noninterpretable methods, based on simulation regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure. © 2020 INFORMS",Ciocan D.F.; Mišić V.V.,Out of scope,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3592,approximate dynamic programming; decision trees; interpretability; optimal stopping; option pricing,5.0,,5,75,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses optimal stopping in stochastic systems, particularly in finance (option pricing), which falls outside the marketing-related applications specified in the definitions.",scopus-machine learning,10,5,Interpretable Optimal Stopping,2022
"This paper examines the applications of copyright protection standards to the creation and utilisation of databases for machine learning purposes and compares the law from Malaysia, Taiwan and the European Union. The current international regime for copyright protection of databases requires that compilations of data be protected “by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents [which] constitute intellectual creations"". However, Malaysia continues to follow the sweat of the brow approach to copyright protection of tables or compilations although a provision similar to TRIPS separately exists. On the other hand, Taiwan adopts a similar, but not identical approach to the TRIPS. The key differences are that Taiwan’s formulation uses the word “creativity” instead of “creation” sans“intellectual” and uses the conjunction “and” instead of “or” between selection and arrangement. The ECJ’s decision in Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo! UK Ltd in interpreting the European Database Directive emphasised that copyright protection for databases must be determined solely on the basis of the selection or arrangement but not on the creation of content. Likewise, the Fixture Marketing cases decided by the ECJ held that only the obtaining, verification or presentation of “existing independent material” matters to the sui generis database rights but not that of newly created data. It would appear that most, if not all, machine learning datasets will not satisfy the “intellectual creations” requirement and thus fail to qualify for copyright protection. Enacting a universal sui generis database protection may not be an easy solution. Perhaps, it is time for the international community to get down from the philosophical high horse and to accept that databases should be protected in copyright simply on account of the effort in their compilation, without the necessity to judge whether there is any intellectual input in the selection or arrangement of their content. © 2021",Khong D.W.K.; Yeh W.-J.,Out of scope,,Copyright Protection of Databases; European Database Directive; Machine Learning Datasets; Malaysia; Taiwan,0.0,,5,85,National Taipei University of Technology,"The abstract discusses copyright protection standards in relation to databases for machine learning, which does not directly relate to marketing applications.",scopus-machine learning,5,5,The Problem of Copyright Protection for Machine Learning Databases: A Comparative Study,2021
"In order to solve the problem of high communication error rate caused by inter symbol interference in high-speed visible light communication signal blind equalization algorithm, a high-speed visible light communication signal blind equalization algorithm is designed based on machine learning. The visible light communication channel model is constructed, and a fusion length limited coding mode is set to make the signal transmitted by visible light communication more in line with the overall response of the channel. The decision feedback equalizer is selected as the equalizer, and the channel cascade impulse response condition is set to compensate the distorted output of the channel. The blind equalization algorithm is designed to classify the data by unsupervised learning, and the extreme point of the error function is found through iterative calculation to optimize the equalizer. The simulation results show that under the same SNR test conditions, the bit error rate of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the blind equalization algorithm based on LMS and BP neural network. Under the condition of SNR = 20dB, the bit error rate is significantly reduced to the order of 10-5, with high communication quality. The VLC system uses an LED backlight display with a CMOS camera. In general, this panel is used to display marketing information. By adjusting the brightness of the CMOS camera's rolling shutter effect (RSE), additional data, such as dynamic content, may be wirelessly sent.

"The potential of neural networks for classification problems has been established by numerous successful applications reported in the literature. One of the major assumptions used in almost all studies is the equal cost consequence of misclassification. With this assumption, minimizing the total number of misclassification errors is the sole objective in developing a neural network classifier. Often this is done simply to ease model development and the selection of classification decision points. However, it is not appropriate for many real situations such as quality assurance, direct marketing, bankruptcy prediction, and medical diagnosis where misclassification costs have unequal consequences for different categories. In this paper, we investigate the issue of unequal misclassification costs in neural network classifiers. Through an application in thyroid disease diagnosis, we find that different cost considerations have significant effects on the classification performance and that appropriate use of cost information can aid in optimal decision making. A cross-validation technique is employed to alleviate the problem of bias in the training set and to examine the robustness of neural network classifiers with regard to sampling variations and cost differences.",Berardi V.L.; Zhang G.P.,Out of scope,10.1111/j.1540-5915.1999.tb00902.x,Classification; Medical diagnosis; Misclassification Costs; Neural Networks; Statistical Techniques,0.0,,0,100,Decision Sciences Institute,"The abstract discusses the application of neural networks to classification problems in medical diagnosis, specifically thyroid disease, which is outside the realm of marketing.",scopus-neural network,0,0,The effect of misclassification costs on neural network classifiers,1999

"This special communication provides a physicians' critique of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s decision to authorise the Vuse Solo (Vuse) Premarket Tobacco Application (PMTA). The PMTA authorisation represents the first time that FDA has authorised an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) for marketing in the USA. Using the FDA Decision Summary, the special communication identifies significant unanswered public health and scientific questions that prevent the authors from reaching FDA's conclusion that Vuse meets the Appropriate for the Protection of the Public Health (APPH) standard. The authors recommend FDA suspend the market authorisation and use these questions to re-evaluate the PMTA, and to prospectively monitor whether Vuse meets APPH standard. The special communication advances the ENDS harm reduction conversation because it calls for national tobacco regulators to develop an epidemiological prediction of ENDS impact on the population and to expand the scope of their analysis to evaluate the impacts of ENDS on congenital birth defects, abuse liability and non-flavour drivers of youth usage. Through learning from the American experience regulating Vuse, national tobacco regulators around the globe will be better equipped to evaluate the impact of ENDS on the public health.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

"Purpose – The share price of any financial institution fluctuates due to various hidden and visible factors. Predicting share price behavior in the economy and financial marketing theory is crucial but complex. The Industrial Bank of Korea’s (IBK) share prices are also affected by hidden factors, including Korean international trade flow. The study aims to forecast hidden impacts on IBK share prices resulting from the international trade flow in Korea. Design/Methodology/Approach – Two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approaches are employed, one based on exports, and the other on imports, to identify trends and fluctuations in the hidden states influencing visible states. Findings – The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between IBK share prices and both exports and imports. Notably, increasing exports indicate a 50% probability of IBK share prices rising, while falling imports indicate a 56% chance of IBK share prices increasing. These results demonstrate how changes in exports and imports impact IBK’s share price in the Korean stock market. Research Implications – The research implications are valuable for short-and long-term investors in IBK shares and the Korean stock exchange. This research can help decision-makers identify the relationships between and within the visible/observed states that influence the stock price of IBK. © 2023 International Academy of Global Business and Trade.

Objective: We analyse a proprietary dataset of HTA outcomes in 7 countries, to (a) test whether HTA decision-making is grounded in welfarist or extra-welfarist approaches; and (b) empirically determine the factors associated with positive HTA outcomes, the time to achieve these and establish the magnitude of inter-country differences in assessment processes. Methods: Data were extracted from publicly available HTA reports on drugs that received marketing authorisation between 2009 and 2018 (N = 1415). The outcomes of interest were the probability of positive HTA outcomes and the time-to-HTA outcome; these were examined with respect to clinical, regulatory, product- and disease-related, evidence uncertainty and contextual variables. Econometric models utilising survival analysis and multinomial logistic regression were specified. Findings: Positive HTA outcomes accounted for 87.3% of the sample (n = 1235), of which 71% (n = 1004) were restricted. Drugs with positive HTA outcomes were subject to clinical restrictions (n = 652, 46%), financial risk-sharing (n = 439, 31%) or had been rejected at least once (n = 282, 20%). Significant predictors of positive HTA outcomes were orphan drugs with cancer indications, high quality of evidence linked to clinical and economic evidence uncertainties which had been overcome, and contextual considerations, particularly innovativeness and unmet need. Comparative analyses revealed systematic differences between countries in their propensity to accept the same drugs, particularly oncology and orphan drugs. Conclusions: Our results are contextual and reinforce arguments in favour of explicitly accounting for social value judgements, establishing separate assessment frameworks for highly uncertain products, adopting risk mitigation strategies for novel therapies with early phase evidence, and sharing of HTA practices across settings. Lastly, HTA agencies have adopted an extra-welfarist approach to value assessment and resource allocation. © 2023 The Authors",Kanavos P.; Visintin E.; Gentilini A.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116045,Affordability; Cost-effectiveness; Drug pricing; Extra-welfarism; Health technology assessment; Priority setting; Social value judgements; Uncertainty,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses health technology assessment (HTA) outcomes and their implications for patient access to therapies, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-prediction,0,0,Algorithms and heuristics of health technology assessments: A retrospective analysis of factors associated with HTA outcomes for new drugs across seven OECD countries,2023
"Research on the adoption of new practices and new behaviors in agriculture continues to grow and evolve, and its relevance to policy remains high. This special issue presents 10 papers that provide overviews of important aspects of the recent adoption literature, or identify gaps and opportunities in the literature. Adoption research has been innovative in a number of ways, including its recognition of adoption decision making as a process, not an event; its emphases on heterogeneity and learning; and its strong multidisciplinary flavor. There is scope for further innovation through efforts to enhance predictions of adoption, better understanding the balance between profit and non-profit motivations, and better recognizing the influence on adoption of characteristics of the innovations, not just characteristics of the potential adopters and their contexts. Opportunities for policy include effort to support women farmers' adoption of beneficial innovations in developing countries, and use of tools and approaches from marketing in public extension programs. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association",Pannell D.; Zilberman D.,Out of scope,10.1002/aepp.13013,adoption of innovations; agricultural extension; agricultural policy; behavior change; technology change,0.0,,0,100,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,"The content of the abstract focuses on agricultural research and adoption practices, which are not related to marketing.

"Understanding how medical practitioners reach a decision on what to prescribe has been one of the more interesting areas of research for some time. Yet the accessible literature in this area is rather limited. Of particular interest is the assessment of the extent to which behaviour is entirely volitional and thus completely under the physician's control. This would determine the extent to which external stimuli, such as communications from the pharmaceutical industry and the media, have any influence or not. On the basis of a small-scale study with 38 physicians in Greece, the importance of isolating normative beliefs and the motivation to comply has been identified as a key factor to understanding the decision process for prescriptions. The evidence shows that prediction of intended prescription behaviour increases significantly when behavioural control is added to the measurements of attitude and subjective norm. In circumstances of high behavioural control, the theory of planned behaviour seems to collapse in favour of the theory of reasoned action. © 2000, SAGE Publications.
