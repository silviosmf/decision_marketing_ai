Out of the fog: fog computing-enabled AI to support smart marketing management,Hornik J.; Ofir C.; Rachamim M.,2024,10.1007/s11301-024-00441-0,"Marketing and consumer research use a variety of data and electronic measurement devices for research, theory-building, and applied decision-making. Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence (AI); Digital marketing; Edge computing; Fog computing; Marketing internet of things (MIoT); O; Smart marketing; Software defined networks (SDN),Springer Nature,scopus-ai
"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Exploring drivers, barriers, and future developments in marketing management",Volkmar G.; Fischer P.M.; Reinecke S.,2022,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.04.007,"Companies neither fully exploit the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), nor that of Machine Learning (ML), its most prominent method. This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics. © 2022 The Authors",Artificial Intelligence; Decision- Making; Delphi Method; Ethics; Machine Learning; Marketing Management,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-ai
When AI meets store layout design: a review,Nguyen K.; Le M.; Martin B.; Cil I.; Fookes C.,2022,10.1007/s10462-022-10142-3,"An efficient store layout presents merchandise to attract customer attention and encourages customers to walk down more aisles which exposes them to more merchandise, which has been shown to be positively correlated with the sales. It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout. © 2022, The Author(s).",Business intelligence; CCTV visual intelligence; Retail layout; Store layout; Video analytic,Springer Nature,scopus-ai
Deploying artificial intelligence in services to AID vulnerable consumers,Hermann E.; Williams G.Y.; Puntoni S.,2023,10.1007/s11747-023-00986-8,"Despite offering substantial opportunities to tailor services to consumers’ wants and needs, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies often come with ethical and operational challenges. One salient instance of such challenges emerges when vulnerable consumers, consumers who temporarily or permanently lack resource access or control, are unknowingly discriminated against, or excluded from the marketplace. By integrating the literature on consumer vulnerability, AI for social good, and the calls for rethinking marketing for a better world, the current work builds a framework on how to leverage AI technologies to detect, better serve, and empower vulnerable consumers. Specifically, our AID framework advocates for designing AI technologies that make services more accessible, optimize customer experiences and journeys interactively, and to dynamically improve consumer decision-making. Adopting a multi-stakeholder perspective, we also discuss the respective implications for researchers, managers, consumers, and public policy makers. © 2023, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Justice; Service; Vulnerable consumers,Springer,scopus-ai

The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation. © 2022,Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

THE IMPACT OF BRAND-VOICE INTEGRATION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING,Murár P.; Kubovics M.; Jurišová V.,2024,10.34135/COMMUNICATIONTODAY.2024.VOL.15.NO.1.4,"Corporate identity plays an important role in the success and competitiveness of businesses in today’s dynamic business environment. It encompasses brand identity, organisational culture, values, and reputation, and is key in building relationships with stakeholders. An ethical corporate identity, in particular the perception of a company as ethical and socially responsible, positively influences employee behaviour and engagement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised business management and offers innovative solutions to improve decision-making, efficiency, and transparency. Integrating AI into corporate governance can improve risk management, compliance, and accountability. In the digital age, social media are key in building and maintaining the brand voice of businesses. With the advent of AI, new tools such as Chat GPT have emerged to simplify and accelerate content creation, including social media posts. However, achieving satisfactory brand-voice results using AI requires careful analysis and extensive, representative data that travels into the prompter. Although AI-generated content is fast, it should be vetted by experienced experts to ensure it aligns with brand values and brand image. Although Chat GPT promises to generate content and brand-voice, its successful use requires collaboration with experienced experts and thoughtful consideration of its use in building and maintaining an authentic and effective brand-voice. © (2024), (University of SS.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic marketing decision-making: a research agenda,Stone M.; Aravopoulou E.; Ekinci Y.; Evans G.; Hobbs M.; Labib A.; Laughlin P.; Machtynger J.; Machtynger L.,2020,10.1108/BL-03-2020-0022,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review literature about the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic situations and identify the research that is needed in the area of applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings: There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications: The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Decision-making; Marketing; Operations; Planning; Strategy,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai
Multiheaded deep learning chatbot for increasing production and marketing,Zheng S.; Yahya Z.; Wang L.; Zhang R.; Hoshyar A.N.,2023,10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103446,"Some businesses on product development prefer to use a chatbot for judging the customer's view. Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-ai

Fog Computing-Based Smart Consumer Recommender Systems,Hornik J.; Ofir C.; Rachamim M.; Graguer S.,2024,10.3390/jtaer19010032,"The latest effort in delivering computing resources as a service to managers and consumers represents a shift away from computing as a product that is purchased, to computing as a service that is delivered to users over the internet from large-scale data centers. However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC).

Evaluation of Enterprise Management Value Chain: Value Co-Creation in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,Alqahtani K.M.,2023,10.33168/JLISS.2023.0418,"Artificial intelligence is a technology that simulates human intelligence by simulating human learning, reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities through computer systems. In recent years, the rapid development and widespread application of AI have had a profound impact on enterprise management. Enterprise management is no longer limited to traditional manual decision-making and processes, but has been endowed with more efficient and intelligent methods through AI technology. The value co creation theory has completely changed the management methods of modern enterprises, transforming them from simple value carriers to active value co creators. In this situation, enterprise value chain management requires strategic enhancement, optimized design, functional management, and reputation management to adapt to these changes. The emergence of artificial intelligence as the core of the new industrial revolution further amplifies the importance of these adaptations. Under the guidance of value co creation theory, this article analyzes and explores the structure, characteristics, and transformation of enterprise value chains. Explored the management strategies of enterprise value chains, with a particular focus on the composition of consumer centered value chains. In addition, it also studied the use of artificial intelligence to deepen the enterprise management value chain, strengthen its architecture through artificial intelligence technology, and design an effective enterprise management system. Considering the changes in the business model of the entire value chain system, the transformation mechanism of artificial intelligence in the enterprise value chain was studied. Integrating neural network algorithms into enterprise management systems can achieve optimization and form a new enterprise management value chain. Empirical experiments and surveys have proven the effectiveness of the new value chain, significantly improving customer satisfaction (11.45%), customer experience satisfaction (13.61%), enterprise marketing satisfaction (11.73%), and enterprise service satisfaction (10.63%). © 2023, Success Culture Press.

Mentorrd EduTech: charting new territories through social media marketing,Senecha N.; Srivastava R.,2022,10.1108/EEMCS-09-2021-0310,"Learning outcomes: After studying and analyzing this case, students will be able to: understand and evaluate the integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategy for online businesses; understand and create the various components of an IMC plan; determine the challenges of scaling up a business and how social media marketing can help in that; learn how to assemble the positioning statement of a startup; determine and differentiate the different business models (revenue models); and understand and create the social media marketing strategy. Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

Factors affecting users’ brand awareness through social media marketing on TikTok,Nguyen C.; Tran T.; Nguyen T.,2024,10.21511/im.20(1).2024.11,"TikTok is increasingly influential in promoting brand awareness and boosting purchase intention. From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users. Limitations and further research suggest that marketers should investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer’s brand awareness-constructing process. © Cuong Nguyen, Thao Tran, Tien Nguyen, 2024.",brand; e-WOM; entertainment; influencer; interactivity; marketing communications; storytelling; trends,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,scopus-ai
Glyphosate and Roundup® Ready Effects in Hydra viridissima: New Data in an Old Issue,Venâncio C.; Barbosa C.; Lopes I.,2023,10.3390/su151612428,"Herbicides are used worldwide to protect agricultural crops, glyphosate being among the most frequently applied. In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient—AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup® Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from ~20% to ~50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released ~70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use. © 2023 by the authors.",environmentally relevant; green hydra; herbicide; life cycle parameters; plant protection products,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-ai
Advertising Benefits from Ethical Artificial Intelligence Algorithmic Purchase Decision Pathways,Rodgers W.; Nguyen T.,2022,10.1007/s10551-022-05048-7,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed the way organizations communicate, understand, and interact with their potential consumers. In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders’ perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an “intelligent advertising” AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising. Several research questions are offered to guide future research on intelligent advertising to benefit ethical AI decision-making. Finally, several areas that can be widely applied to ethical intelligent advertising are suggested for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).",AI Algorithms; Digital marketing; Ethical considerations,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,scopus-ai

TRADEMARKS IN AN ALGORITHMIC WORLD,Farley C.H.,2023,,"According to the sole normative foundation for trademark protection—“search costs” theory—trademarks transmit useful information to consumers, enabling an efficient marketplace. The marketplace, however, is in the midst of a fundamental change. Increasingly, retail is virtual, marketing is data-driven, and purchasing decisions are automated by AI. Predictive analytics are changing how consumers shop. Search costs theory no longer accurately describes the function of trademarks in this marketplace. Consumers now have numerous digital alternatives to trademarks that more efficiently provide them with increasingly accurate product information. Just as store shelves are disappearing from consumers’ retail experience, so are trademarks disappearing from their product search. Consumers may want to buy a product where the brand is the essential feature of the product such that the brand is the product, but they no longer need the assistance of a trademark to find the product. By reflexively continuing to protect trademarks in the name of search costs theory, courts give only lip service to consumer interests without questioning whether trademarks are fulfilling any useful information function. In many cases, trademarks may actually misinform consumers by masking the identity of the producer or its distanced relationship with the trademark owner. Without having deliberately decided to do so, trademark law is now protecting “brands as property” without any supportive normative rationale. Removing the veil of search costs theory will enable courts to consider whether trademark protection is justified in particular cases. © 2023, University of Washington School of Law.

Artificial intelligence for hospitality big data analytics: developing a prediction model of restaurant review helpfulness for customer decision-making,Lee M.; Kwon W.; Back K.-J.,2021,10.1108/IJCHM-06-2020-0587,"Purpose: Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners’ marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers’ decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Prediction; Restaurant reviews; Review helpfulness,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai
Interpretable video tag recommendation with multimedia deep learning framework,Yang Z.; Lin Z.,2022,10.1108/INTR-08-2020-0471,"Purpose: Tags help promote customer engagement on video-sharing platforms. Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai
The sustainability of artificial intelligence: an urbanistic viewpoint from the lens of smart and sustainable cities,Yigitcanlar T.; Cugurullo F.,2020,10.3390/su12208548,"The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Big industries started adopting AI for their HR and workforce management (WFM) activities, however, past literature suggests a lack of AI adoption in MSMEs. In the ongoing pandemic, a large number of job loss is reported in the literature. Thus, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent workforce management (WFM) may be critical during or post-pandemic to manage the huge employment in MSMEs. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual framework based on three areas where AI-powered WFM adoption for MSMEs revenue development has been highlighted. These are (a) risk management (workforce), (b) business and marketing, and (c) information exchange. Six hypotheses have been proposed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) with responses from 307 employees. According to the research findings, all of the offered hypotheses are significant. The findings suggest to MSME decision-makers that AI-powered WFM may help revenue growth, workforce risk reduction, intelligent business and marketing, and thoughtful, innovative, and safe information exchange.

The information is used to create the model and improve the quality of products and services to satisfy customers. There are two major parts to a sale's planning: containing sales tactics and sales strategy. To aid in business decision-making, a data warehouse (DW) for sales collects and organizes relevant and historical data. DW is also a method for combining data from various heterogeneous databases (DB) and other sources of information for analysis. In this paper, Information analysis for dynamic Sale planning by AI Decision support process was done. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithms have been used to find optimal MVs for sale planning since several authors prove that these algorithms are better than other existing algorithms. MVs selection is based on three factors: time running of MVs, area of MVs, and access frequency of MVs by manipulating the selection result using a weighted combination of each factor as needed by the designer. For PSO, the most cost of frequency was 1.924 for View (V) 11, while for QPSO, it was 1.722 for V11. For PSO, the most cost of time was 1.931 for V2, while for QPSO, it was 1.221 for V22. For PSO, the most cost of the area was 1.800 for V17, while for QPSO, it was 1.071 for V17.

Impact of artificial intelligence on aeronautics: An industry-wide review,Zaoui A.; Tchuente D.; Wamba S.F.; Kamsu-Foguem B.,2024,10.1016/j.jengtecman.2024.101800,"Curiously, there are few contributions in the scientific literature on the subject of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on aeronautics. However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency. © 2024 The Authors",Aeronautics; Artificial Intelligence; Benefits; Performance; Use cases,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-ai
Public perceptions of artificial intelligence in healthcare: ethical concerns and opportunities for patient-centered care,Witkowski K.; Okhai R.; Neely S.R.,2024,10.1186/s12910-024-01066-4,"Background: In an effort to improve the quality of medical care, the philosophy of patient-centered care has become integrated into almost every aspect of the medical community. Despite its widespread acceptance, among patients and practitioners, there are concerns that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence may threaten elements of patient-centered care, such as personal relationships with care providers and patient-driven choices. This study explores the extent to which patients are confident in and comfortable with the use of these technologies when it comes to their own individual care and identifies areas that may align with or threaten elements of patient-centered care. Methods: An exploratory, mixed-method approach was used to analyze survey data from 600 US-based adults in the State of Florida. The survey was administered through a leading market research provider (August 10–21, 2023), and responses were collected to be representative of the state’s population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Results: Respondents were more comfortable with the use of AI in health-related tasks that were not associated with doctor-patient relationships, such as scheduling patient appointments or follow-ups (84.2%). Fear of losing the ‘human touch’ associated with doctors was a common theme within qualitative coding, suggesting a potential conflict between the implementation of AI and patient-centered care. In addition, decision self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of comfort with AI, but there were also concerns about losing decision-making control, workforce changes, and cost concerns. A small majority of participants mentioned that AI could be useful for doctors and lead to more equitable care but only when used within limits. Conclusion: The application of AI in medical care is rapidly advancing, but oversight, regulation, and guidance addressing critical aspects of patient-centered care are lacking. While there is no evidence that AI will undermine patient-physician relationships at this time, there is concern on the part of patients regarding the application of AI within medical care and specifically as it relates to their interaction with physicians. Medical guidance on incorporating AI while adhering to the principles of patient-centered care is needed to clarify how AI will augment medical care. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence; Patient-centered care; Patient-physician relationship; Public perception,BioMed Central Ltd,scopus-ai

How to Build an AI Climate-Driven Service Analytics Capability for Innovation and Performance in Industrial Markets?,Akter S.; Wamba S.F.; Mariani M.; Hani U.,2021,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.07.014,"AI climate-driven service analytics capability has been anecdotally argued as a viable strategy to enhance service innovation and market performance in B2B markets. While AI climate refers to the shared perceptions of policies, procedures, and practices to support AI initiatives, cognitive service analytics capability refers to the analytical insights driven by AI climate and augmented by both machines and humans to make marketing decisions. However, there is limited knowledge on the antecedents of such analytics capabilities and their overall effects on service innovation and market performance. Drawing on service analytics literature and the microfoundations of dynamic capability theory, this study fills this research gap using in-depth interviews (n = 30) and a survey (n = 276) of service analytics managers within the AI climate in Australia. The findings confirm the five microfoundations of cognitive service analytics capabilities (cognitive technology, cognitive information, cognitive problem solving, cognitive knowledge & skills, cognitive training & development).

Air India-Vistara merger – maneuvering “Vihaan.AI” through the turbulence,Chaudhary P.,2023,10.1108/EEMCS-07-2023-0243,"Learning outcomes: The expected learning outcomes are to understand the complexities involved in the integration of two carriers with different business strategies and approaches, the merger of two brands with distinct personas and identities and the confluence of two different cultures; figure out the strategic options in front of the Tata Group and how it can deal with various macro- and micro-level business challenges, defy the financial hiccups and manoeuvre the operational complexities to accomplish mission Vihaan.AI; and develop a pragmatic approach to macro and micro business environmental scanning for making strategic business decisions. Case overview/synopsis: In November 2022, Tata Group, the salt to software conglomerate, announced the merger of Air India (AI) and Vistara. This would lead to the formation of the full-service airline under the brand name “Air India”. The obvious reason behind this was the higher recognition, salience and recall of the brand AI as compared with Vistara in the global market. The Tata Group envisaged the brand AI to be a significant international aviation player with the heritage, persona and ethos of the brand Vistara in the renewed manifestation of AI. To realise these goals, Tata Group laid down an ambitious plan called “Vihaan.AI”, which was aimed at capturing a domestic market share of 30% by 2027.

Framing the communication: The effectiveness of price promotion in the Cash&Carry format; [La comunicazione del pricing di breve e di lungo periodo ai fini della costruzione dell’immagine di convenienza nel Cash&Carry],Cristini G.; Cardinali M.G.; Grandi B.,2019,10.1431/93966,"Understanding how to increase satisfaction and loyalty is of interest to retailers since it has been demonstrated that loyal customers are more profitable than non-loyal ones. The extant literature demonstrated that marketing mix components can affect the satisfaction and loyalty to the retailer. These levers can be divided into two groups: micro (price differentiation, fidelity cards) and macro (price, assortment, private label, services) levers. Among macro ones, price seems to be the most important variable able to influence the selection of a retailer, the level of satisfaction and loyalty. However, customers are not able to judge the real value for money, so it is very important to analyze the perceived price image and to identify the variables on which it depends on. Previous studies have demonstrated that our perceptions, judgments and even preferences are influenced by the way decision problems are framed, so how pricing strategies are communicated is a critical element. This is true, not only for companies that face with final customers but also for wholesalers and, specifically, for Cash and Carry wholesalers, which face with final customers, restaurants and retailers. But, if on one hand, price communication has been deeply investigated in the retailing sector, the same cannot be said for what concerns wholesalers and, in particular, Cash and Carry format. For these reasons, the present work aims to analyze the impact of different ways of price communication can affect customers’ satisfaction and loyalty in the Cash and Carry format, through focus groups methodology, given the novelty of the topic. Findings could help wholesalers to more optimally communicate price promotions in order to better meet the needs of different types of customers and increase the level of satisfaction. © 2019 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

Artificial Intelligence Chatbots: A Survey of Classical versus Deep Machine Learning Techniques,Alazzam B.A.; Alkhatib M.; Shaalan K.,2023,10.18576/isl/120437,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to be intelligent, most importantly using Machine Learning (ML) in which machines are trained to be able to make better decisions and predictions. In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning,Natural Sciences Publishing,scopus-ai
In companies we trust: consumer adoption of artificial intelligence services and the role of trust in companies and AI autonomy,Frank D.-A.; Jacobsen L.F.; Søndergaard H.A.; Otterbring T.,2023,10.1108/ITP-09-2022-0721,"Purpose: Companies utilize increasingly capable Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to deliver modern services across a range of consumer service industries. AI autonomy, however, sparks skepticism among consumers leading to a decrease in their willingness to adopt AI services. This raises the question as to whether consumer trust in companies can overcome consumer reluctance in their decisions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services. Design/methodology/approach: Using a representative survey (N = 503 consumers corresponding to N = 3,690 observations), this article investigated the link between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services from the company across 23 consumer service companies accounting for six distinct service industries. Findings: The results confirm a significant and positive relationship between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt AI services from the same company. AI autonomy, however, moderates this relationship, such that high (vs low) AI autonomy weakens the positive link between trust in a company and AI service adoption. This finding replicates across all 23 companies and the associated six industries and is robust to the inclusion of several theoretically important control variables. Originality/value: The current research contributes to the recent stream of AI research by drawing attention to the interplay between trust in companies and adoption of high autonomy AI services, with implications for the successful deployment and marketing of AI services. © 2023, Darius-Aurel Frank, Lina Fogt Jacobsen, Helle Alsted Søndergaard and Tobias Otterbring.",Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Innovation adoption; Trust in the company,Emerald Publishing,scopus-ai

Design principles for artificial intelligence-augmented decision making: An action design research study,Herath Pathirannehelage S.; Shrestha Y.R.; von Krogh G.,2024,10.1080/0960085X.2024.2330402,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated, garnering significant interest among information systems (IS) scholars. AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing.

Our study revealed that AI-driven campaigns can improve both the Open Rate and Click Rate. This approach has the potential to enhance customer engagement and retention for businesses while enabling well-informed decisions by leveraging insights derived from consumer data. This work contributes to the existing body of research on MLaaS in marketing and offers practical insights for businesses seeking to utilise this approach to enhance their competitive edge in the contemporary data-oriented marketplace. © 2024 by the authors.",churn prediction; machine learning; marketing; MLaaS; product recommendation; send frequency; service,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-ai
Exploring international students’ adoption of AI-enabled voice assistants in enrolment decision making: a grounded theory approach,Pawar S.K.; Vispute S.A.,2023,10.1080/08841241.2023.2239720,"The proliferation and increasing significance of AI-enabled voice assistants (AIVAs) for consumer purchase decisions imply the need for a better understanding of their acceptance in the higher education (HE) enrollment context. Using the Grounded Theory (GT) research method and a consumer value perspective, we examine the enrolment decision-making of international students in the presence of AIVAs to propose a conceptual model linking value to adoption. Findings highlight the influence of the key antecedents of hedonic and functional value in AIVA adoption. The findings also indicate that the student and the AIVA can co-create novel experiences during information search and evaluation of enrollment alternatives. Some participants proactively suggest a larger role for the AIVA to aid their enrollment decision-making.

Impact of the new middle class on consumer behavior: a case study of Delhi-NCR,Chaudhary A.; Khatoon S.,2022,10.1108/JABES-07-2020-0080,"Purpose: The paper examines the increase in annual income of the new middle-class (The NMC) of Delhi-NCR and its impact on their investment habits, consumption habits and lifestyle. The paper aims to look into the transformation of the new middle-class into the NMC in emerging economies and its potential to the companies and investors. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws insight from 558 new middle-class consumers in Delhi-NCR. ANOVA, post hoc tests, and hierarchical multiple linear regression model are applied to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The NMC living in India's megacities imitates the lifestyle of their counterparts living in the West. To maintain their status and present themselves different from those living in middle or lower-middle-class categories, they spend audaciously, even though the income is low. When they enter the new middle class, their consumption, saving and lifestyle diversify positively. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations. First, the authors do not apply any behavioral theory or marketing model such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA), Engel-kollat-Blackwell (EKB) model or theory of normative model of target markets. Second, the research is limited to the NMC of only one emerging economy, i.e., India. Third, the research sample is limited to only one megacity of India, i.e., Delhi. Finally, this research used only one factor, i.e., AI, to study the consumption pattern. Practical implications: The results suggest that considering the buying habits and lifestyle of Indian the NMC, consumers would prove helpful to the companies in product decision-making. Furthermore, understanding change in investment habits across different income levels would be advantageous to financial institutions, investment planners and marketers while designing their products to attract investment. Originality/value: The research holds significance from the point of view of understanding Indian consumers encompassing the the NMC and predicting their implications on consumer goods-producing industries, which shall, in turn, facilitate producers and government in formulating policies and strategies. © 2021, Asiya Chaudhary and Sabiha Khatoon.",Annual income (AI); Buying/ spending habits (B/SH); Consumer behavior (CB); Investment habits (IH); Lifestyle (LS); Middle class (MC); New middle class (NMC),Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai

Does marketing analytics capability boost firms' competitive marketing performance in data-rich business environment?,Rahman M.S.; Hossain M.A.; Abdel Fattah F.A.M.,2022,10.1108/JEIM-05-2020-0185,"Purpose: Few well-documented studies have explained the importance of researching firms' marketing analytics capability (FMAC). In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance.

More than words can say: a multimodal approach to understanding meaning and sentiment in social media,Mehmet M.I.; D’Alessandro S.,2022,10.1080/0267257X.2022.2105933,"The authors develop a multimodal social listening analysis (MSLA) approach as a framework for managers to understand how meaning is constructed in social media posts using both text and other media. The research adds to AI and text analysis approaches by considering the whole meaning of a post rather than an analysis of subsets of information in text and other media. The use of MSLA is validated across the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The findings show that MSLA helps (i) reveal structures in what appear to be unstructured multimodal posts; (ii) identify all the sentiment items in a post; (iii) identify implicit meanings, such as irony, humour and sarcasm; and (iv) further identify emotions and judgements in multimodal communication. Importantly, this paper explains how decisions and opinions are made online and how marketing strategies can be tailored towards meanings derived from multimodal communication in social media. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.",consumer sentiment; inter-coder reliability; Multimodal social listening; qualitative research; social media; social networking,Routledge,scopus-ai

The role of brand in overcoming consumer resistance to autonomous vehicles,Casidy R.; Claudy M.; Heidenreich S.; Camurdan E.,2021,10.1002/mar.21496,"Consumer resistance is a major barrier to diffusing radical innovation into mainstream markets. While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",artificial intelligence; autonomous vehicles; brand concept; innovation; self-brand connection,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-ai

Enhanced Marketing Decision Making for Consumer Behaviour Classification Using Binary Decision Trees and a Genetic Algorithm Wrapper,Gkikas D.C.; Theodoridis P.K.; Beligiannis G.N.,2022,10.3390/informatics9020045,"An excessive amount of data is generated daily. A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

Deep Learning-Based Prediction and Revenue Optimization for Online Platform User Journeys,Wang T.-C.,2024,10.3934/QFE.2024001,"In today’s digital landscape, businesses must allocate online resources efficiently. Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.",customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,scopus-ai
A study on intelligent technology valuation system: Introduction of kibo patent appraisal system ii,Kim M.-S.; Lee C.-H.; Choi J.-H.; Jang Y.-J.; Lee J.-H.; Lee J.; Sung T.-E.,2021,10.3390/su132212666,"Technology finance, which has attracted worldwide attention for the successful business development of small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) or start-ups, has advanced an innovation or stagnation way-out resolution strategy for companies in line with the low-growth economic trends. Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R&D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company’s management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company’s growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm’s commercialization strategy. For the last years, the KIBO Patent Appraisal System (KPAS-II) herein proposed has been advanced by KIBO as a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI) and evaluation data applications valuation system that automatically calculates and estimates a technology’s feasible economic value by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic index information of a patent and the commercialization entity’s business ca-pabilities, and by applying to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method in valuation theory, and finally integrating with deep learning results based on the in-advance previously established patent DB and the financial DB. The KPAS-II proposed in this study can be said to have dramatically overcome the long-term preparation period and high levels of R&D and commercialization costs in terms of the limitations that the existing technology valuation method possesses by enhancing the reliability of approximate economic values from the deep learning results based on financial data and completed valuation data. In addition, it is expected that technology marketing coordinators, researchers, and non-specialty business agents, not limited to valuation experts, can easily estimate the economic values of their patents or technologies, and they can be actively utilized in a technology-based company’s decision-making and technologically dependent financial activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Convergence and divergence in social entrepreneurship in Russia,Popkova E.G.; Sergi B.S.,2020,10.1108/JIC-09-2019-0224,"Purpose: The purpose of this article is to determine the future proportion and variants of usage of human intellect and artificial intelligence (AI) in entrepreneurship of industry 4.0 that fits social entrepreneurship the most. It could be convergence (simultaneous utilization during the same entrepreneurial processes with the emphasis on unique features by the terms of the competition) or divergence (usage during different business processes by the terms of labor division). Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the influence of usage of human capital and AI on the efficiency of social entrepreneurship. The authors identify the perspective directions of usage of AI in social entrepreneurship and evaluate the readiness and interest in the implementation of these directions of concerned parties. The authors also model the optimal proportions and the variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in the future (until 2030). Findings: It is found that social entrepreneurship will use the opportunities of Industry 4.0 for optimization of its activities until 2030, but will refuse from full automatization, using human intellect and AI at the same time. Originality/value: The most perspective directions of application of AI at social companies are a collection of social goods and services, marketing studies and promotion of social goods and services. Neither convergence nor divergence of human and artificial intellectual capital does not fully conform to the interests of concerned parties. The most preferable (optimal) variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the Industry 4.0 is human intelligent decision support. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",AI; Digital personnel; Intellectual capital; Social entrepreneurship,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai
"Artificial intelligence-enabled environmental sustainability of products: Marketing benefits and their variation by consumer, location, and product types",Frank B.,2021,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125242,"Firms are developing AI-enhanced products (e.g., robots) that can tackle environmental problems through autonomous interactions with their surroundings (e.g., removing waste/pollutants, tracking invasive species) and autonomous learning, which results in improved environmental performance characteristics. Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-ai
Perception of Innovative Usage of AI in Optimizing Customer Purchasing Experience within the Sustainable Fashion Industry,Bolesnikov M.; Popović Stijačić M.; Keswani A.B.; Brkljač N.,2022,10.3390/su141610082,"The research was designed to contribute to scientific efforts in exploring the attitude of fashion stakeholders towards AI and its use in attaining sustainability in fashion industry. Although the role of AI in Fashion has been studied before, the aim of this research is to challenge and analyze the attitudes towards sustainable fashion of both stakeholders and consumers. The research considers the views of consumers, industry professionals and company shareholders on the role AI plays in pursuing ideas of Sustainable Fashion. Contrary to expectations, the companies with significant turnover did not show any greater awareness of the new trends in the fashion business. Furthermore, previous familiarity with the usage of AI did not prove to promote openness towards the recommendation of apps which use AI to promote Sustainable Fashion. The value of this research lies in the findings, which help provide a framework which can be used to change the viewpoint of the key market players. The crucial finding is that the AI approach on sustainability will influence both users (changing their purchasing decisions toward more sustainable choices if provided with a set of information on ecological impact, production choices), and corporate businesses (changing the overall business strategy, planning, marketing communication and production designs). The paper offers milestones for further research on synergies between AI, fashion industry lined with UNS SDGs and purchasing behavior. © 2022 by the authors.",AI smart apps; business models; customer experience; efficiency; environment; fashion industry; Industry 4.0; innovation; pollution; sustainability,MDPI,scopus-ai
Ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing: an exploration of solutions,Kumar D.; Suthar N.,2024,10.1108/JICES-05-2023-0068,"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked interest in various areas, including marketing. However, this exhilaration is being tempered by growing concerns about the moral and legal implications of using AI in marketing. Although previous research has revealed various ethical and legal issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and data privacy, there are no definitive answers. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating AI’s ethical and legal concerns in marketing and suggesting feasible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper synthesises information from academic articles, industry reports, case studies and legal documents through a thematic literature review. A qualitative analysis approach categorises and interprets ethical and legal challenges and proposes potential solutions. Findings: The findings of this paper raise concerns about ethical and legal challenges related to AI in the marketing area. Ethical concerns related to discrimination, bias, manipulation, job displacement, absence of social interaction, cybersecurity, unintended consequences, environmental impact, privacy and legal issues such as consumer security, responsibility, liability, brand protection, competition law, agreements, data protection, consumer protection and intellectual property rights are discussed in the paper, and their potential solutions are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding the interesting insights gathered from this investigation of the ethical and legal consequences of AI in marketing, it is important to recognise the limits of this research. Initially, the focus of this study is confined to a review of the most important ethical and legal issues pertaining to AI in marketing. Additional possible repercussions, such as those associated with intellectual property, contracts and licencing, should be investigated more deeply in future studies. Despite the fact that this study gives various answers and best practices for tackling the stated ethical and legal concerns, the viability and efficacy of these solutions may differ depending on the context and industry. Thus, more research and case studies are required to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of these solutions in other circumstances. This research is mostly based on a literature review and may not represent the experiences or opinions of all stakeholders engaged in AI-powered marketing. Further study might involve interviews or surveys with marketing professionals, customers and other key stakeholders to offer a full knowledge of the practical difficulties and solutions. Because of the rapid speed of technical progress, AI’s ethical and regulatory ramifications in marketing are continually increasing. Consequently, this work should be a springboard for more research and continuing conversations on this subject. Practical implications: This study’s findings have several practical implications for marketing professionals. Emphasising openness and explainability: Marketing professionals should prioritise transparency in their use of AI, ensuring that customers are fully informed about data collection and utilisation for targeted advertising. By promoting openness and explainability, marketers can foster customer trust and avoid the negative consequences of a lack of transparency. Establishing ethical guidelines: Marketing professionals need to develop ethical rules for the creation and implementation of AI-powered marketing strategies. Adhering to ethical principles ensures compliance with legal norms and aligns with the organisation’s values and ideals. Investing in bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology: To mitigate risks associated with AI in marketing, marketers should allocate resources to develop and implement bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology. These tools can identify and address biases in AI algorithms, safeguard consumer privacy and extract valuable insights from consumer data. Social implications: This study’s social implications emphasise the need for a comprehensive approach to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing. This includes adopting a responsible innovation framework, promoting ethical leadership, using ethical decision-making frameworks and conducting multidisciplinary research. By incorporating these approaches, marketers can navigate the complexities of AI in marketing responsibly, foster an ethical organisational culture, make informed ethical decisions and develop effective solutions. Such practices promote public trust, ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk, and mitigate potential negative social consequences associated with AI in marketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is among the first to explore potential solutions comprehensively. This paper provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges by using a multidisciplinary framework and synthesising various sources. It contributes valuable insights for academia and industry. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",AI in marketing; Artificial intelligence; Ethical challenges; Legal implications; Marketing; Solution proposals,Emerald Publishing,scopus-ai
"One pie, many recipes: The role of artificial intelligence chatbots in influencing Malaysian solo traveler purchase intentions",Chang J.Y.-S.; Cheah J.-H.; Lim X.-J.; Morrison A.M.,2023,10.1016/j.tmp.2023.101191,"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are pervasive in the travel industry and have significantly alleviated solo travelers' concerns in trip planning and booking. However, many existing AI chatbots have yet to meet the expectations of solo travelers, especially when they demand more personalized information to assist in travel decision-making. Based on complexity theory, this research examines the factors that stimulate solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, particularly covering the three main aspects of marketing efforts, communication quality, and affective characteristics. Drawing from a sample of 281 solo travelers, partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used to examine the proposed relationships. The PLS-SEM results illustrate that interaction, entertainment, trendiness, communication competence, and satisfaction have significant direct effects on purchase intentions. The fsQCA results further revealed four solutions exhibiting high purchase intentions among solo travelers. Different core, peripheral, and necessary causal conditions in each configuration path were identified. The findings enrich the AI chatbot literature by examining the underlying reasons why solo travelers react differently to this emerging technology and produce practical recommendations for designing AI chatbot systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",AI chatbot; fsQCA; PLS-SEM; Purchase intentions; Solo travelers; Tourism,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-ai

Freedom from interference: Decisional privacy as a dimension of consumer privacy online,Bjørlo L.V.,2024,10.1007/s13162-024-00273-x,"The introduction of AI-based technologies has dramatically altered the premises for consumer privacy, enabling the unprecedented manipulation of consumers’ decision-making online. Given these recent threats to consumer privacy and autonomy, and considering autonomy as the ultimate outcome of privacy, I propose that a reconceptualization is warranted to reflect contemporary consumer privacy challenges and to realign the concept with its theoretical foundations. To this end, I introduce the dimension of decisional privacy, focused on autonomy versus interference in consumer decision-making. Building on previous privacy literature and extending previous theorizing about information privacy and decisional privacy as complementary, I posit that these two dimensions of privacy together comprise consumer privacy. Addressing protection from interference as an under-communicated function of consumer privacy, the paper aims to clarify, exemplify, and engage in the conceptual development of decisional privacy in the context of consumer decision-making online. In addition to its significance for consumer wellbeing and democracy collectively, the extension of consumer privacy to explicitly encompass interference has theoretical implications for privacy concern, the proxy used to measure privacy, yielding important insights for marketing scholars and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2024.",Autonomy; Consumer privacy; Decisional privacy; Privacy; Privacy concerns,Springer,scopus-ai
Future-proofing Search Engine Marketing: An Empirical Investigation of Effects of Search Engine Results on Consumer Purchase Decisions,Diwanji V.S.; Lee J.; Cortese J.,2023,10.1080/0965254X.2023.2229343,"A popular joke amongst marketers is that the best place to hide a dead body is page two of search results. Meaning, nobody looks beyond the first page of search results. In a cookie-free future, search engines double down on how marketers communicate expertise, authority, and trust. This pushes brands to shift away from product-focused search engine marketing, toward an intent-based approach. To stay at the top of search engine results, marketers must understand consumer assessment of search results. Guided by an integrated framework combining UTAUT2, theory of reasoned action, and media richness theory, this empirical study used a 2 (search result type: organic vs. sponsored) × 3 (presentation format: text-only vs. image vs. video) between-subjects research design for assessing the effects of search results on consumer decisions.

"Sophia Sophia tell me more, which is the most risk-free plan of all? AI anthropomorphism and risk aversion in financial decision-making",Cui Y.,2022,10.1108/IJBM-09-2021-0451,"Purpose: This research examines whether anthropomorphizing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots alters consumers' risk preferences toward financial investment options involving differential risks. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3). Originality/value: Anthropomorphizing AI has undeniable relevance in the contemporary marketing landscape, such as humanoid robotics and emotion AI algorithms. Despite of anthropomorphism's significance and relevance, the downstream impact of anthropomorphism remains unfortunately underexplored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence (AI); Political ideology; Psychological closeness; Psychological risk attachment; Risk aversion,Emerald Publishing,scopus-ai
When do you trust AI? The effect of number presentation detail on consumer trust and acceptance of AI recommendations,Kim J.; Giroux M.; Lee J.C.,2021,10.1002/mar.21498,"When do consumers trust artificial intelligence (AI)? With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision-making literature. Moreover, this study makes practical implications for marketers of AI businesses including those who strategically use AI-generated information. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",AI adoption; AI technology; artificial intelligence; marketing; preciseness; recommendation; trust,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-ai
Transparency and insurance professionals: a study of Swedish insurance practice attitudes and future development,Dexe J.; Franke U.; Rad A.,2021,10.1057/s41288-021-00207-9,"The insurance industry is being challenged by increased adoption of automated decision-making. AI advances could conceivably automate everything: marketing, customer service, underwriting and claims management alike. However, such automation challenges consumer trust, as there is considerable public and scholarly debate over the ‘black box’ character of many algorithms. Insurance being a business of trust, this suggests a dilemma. One suggested solution involves adopting algorithms in a transparent manner. This article reports a study of how Swedish insurers deal with this dilemma, based on (i) eight interviews with insurance professionals representing four companies with a joint market share of 45–50% of the Swedish property insurance market and (ii) a questionnaire answered by 71 professionals in a Swedish insurance company. The results show that while transparency is seen as potentially valuable, most Swedish insurers do not use it to gain a competitive advantage or identify clear limits to transparency and are not using AI extensively. © 2021, The Geneva Association.",Competitive advantage; Insurance; Openness; Sweden; Transparency; Trust,Palgrave Macmillan,scopus-ai

Artificial intelligence in healthcare: the value co-creation process and influence of other digital health transformations,Swan E.L.; Peltier J.W.; Dahl A.J.,2024,10.1108/JRIM-09-2022-0293,"Purpose: Digital transformations are altering service models and care delivery methods in healthcare. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next wave of transformation in healthcare. This study aims to understand patient perceptions of AI and its impact on value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed to investigate how value co-creation operant resources (digital self-efficacy and relational service quality) impact value co-creation engagement (shared decision-making) and value co-creation outcomes (anticipatory AI value co-creation and intention to adopt AI). Data were collected from 332 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that the value co-creation process for AI technologies is a function of inputs, experiences and AI outputs. Operant resources were found to be positively associated with shared decision-making. However, not all operant resources directly and positively impacted AI outcomes. The indirect and positive mediated relationships through shared decision-making to AI outcomes suggest an interactive AI value co-creation process. Research limitations/implications: AI technologies are still in early stages of consumer adoption in healthcare. Future research is warranted that investigates the validity of the model through maturing service life cycles. Practical implications: Customer perceptions of new digital innovations are formed in the context of previous digital experiences.

This was achieved through a cross-priority ranking analysis, which identified trends in the development of digital technologies in marketing communications and global marketing. Data from 25 expert organisations was used to form a set of 32 digital solutions. Using a developed methodology, these solutions were ranked, revealing the top 6 with the highest potential for transforming marketing communications. The rankings showed a discrepancy between the mentioned frequency ranking and the priority ranking, indicating the influence of marketing organizations' experience. Currently, social media platforms, particularly influencer marketing, are closely integrated with e-commerce, explaining their high mention frequency. However, a cross-ranking analysis revealed a trend towards AI technologies in marketing communications processes. It has been established that obtaining credit funds for the deployment of modernized marketing campaigns and strategies impacts the financial security of such organizations. Moreover, the utilization of optimal conversion-oriented digital marketing tools allows for a significant reduction in financial risks and an increase in the profitability of companies. The study further identified the future direction of global marketing development, which involves immersive strategies that deeply integrate and extensively use AI technologies. These strategies aim to enhance consumer interest and engagement.

A Framework for Collaborative Artificial Intelligence in Marketing,Huang M.-H.; Rust R.T.,2022,10.1016/j.jretai.2021.03.001,"We develop a conceptual framework for collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing, providing systematic guidance for how human marketers and consumers can team up with AI, which has profound implications for retailing, which is the interface between marketers and consumers. Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived.

Advancing Consumer Behavior: The Role of Artificial Intelligence Technologies and Knowledge Sharing,Olan F.; Suklan J.; Arakpogun E.O.; Robson A.,2021,10.1109/TEM.2021.3083536,"The increasing use of digital technologies has significantly reshaped marketing and consumer behavior (CB) as online communities and cutting-edge innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupt and advance consumer attitudes on specific products and services. As such, online communities that are supported by AI technologies creating new knowledge from consumer interactions through platforms like social media as consumers share experiences on specific products or services. Since AI is designed to &#x201C;learn&#x201D; and improve with data generated from digital technologies linked to consumer interactions, AI relies on consumer knowledge-sharing (KS) activities to replicate new knowledge for product and service improvement. However, given the knowledge gap in this area, this article applies the fsQCA technique to data generated from 291 participants to develop CB metaframework predicted on the concepts of AI, CB, and KS. Our results suggest that AI advances consumer attitudes and behaviors when knowledge is acquired while online communities promote curiosity and engage consumers to learn by sharing experiences about specific products or services.

Diversity representation in advertising,Campbell C.; Sands S.; McFerran B.; Mavrommatis A.,2023,10.1007/s11747-023-00994-8,"In this article we develop a comprehensive understanding of diverse representation in advertising. While numerous studies highlight increasing demand for diversity among some consumers, such enthusiasm is not universal. This is creating challenges for brands, some of which have faced backlash, either due to a perceived lack of authenticity in their diversity efforts or because not all consumer groups value diversity equally. Amidst these challenges, technological advancements, such as data-driven decision-making and generative AI, present both new opportunities and risks. The current literature on diverse representation in advertising, although expansive, is relatively siloed. Through a detailed eight-step process, we assess and synthesize the body of literature on diversity representation, reviewing 337 articles spanning research on age, beauty, body size, gender, LGBTQIA+ , physical and mental ability, and race and ethnicity. Our investigation offers two major contributions: a summarization of insights from the broader literature on these seven key areas of diverse representation and development of an integrated conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework details mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes that are either prevalent across the literature or can be reasonably expected to generalize across other forms of diversity.

AI voice bots: a services marketing research agenda,Klaus P.; Zaichkowsky J.,2020,10.1108/JSM-01-2019-0043,"Purpose: This paper aims to document how AI has changed the way consumers make decisions and propose how that change impacts services marketing, service research and service management. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings: Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers’ decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications: In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model. Originality/value: The change in consumer behavior leads to a change in the service marketing approach needed in the world of AI. The bot, the new service platform is now in charge of search and choice for many purchase situations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial Intelligence; Big data; Bots; Consumer decision-making; Customer experience; Customer service; Robotics; Service experience; Service platforms; Service strategy; Services marketing,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai
NEUROMARKETING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE CASE OF CRUZCAMPO'S CAMPAIGN ‘WITH A STRONG ACCENT’; [NEUROMARKETING E INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL: EL CASO DE LA CAMPAÑA ‘CON MUCHO ACENTO’ DE CRUZCAMPO],Ferruz-González S.-A.; Sidorenko-Bautista P.; López C.S.,2023,10.33732/ixc/13/02Neurom,"Since neuroscience broke into the field of marketing at the beginning of the 21st century, it has been proven that consumers base a large part of their daily decisions on their feelings, based on stimuli that move them rather than solely relying on conscious and rational factors. The research presents a case analysis of an award-winning Spot that uses artificial intelligence as the basis of the creative idea. Its objective is to assess the extent to which the implementation of this resource is pertinent in eliciting emotions, influencing brand awareness and perception, and fostering a favorable attitude towards the brand. For the analysis, a neuromarketing technique has been used, the Implicit Association Test, complemented with in-depth interviews and a CAWI survey. The results suggest that the use of AI in the creation of advertising messages favors the generation of positive attitudes toward the brand since it enhances the strength of the message transmitted, but it does not seem to influence the brand image or the intention to consume it. © 2023, Rey Juan Carlos University.

Leverage zones in Responsible AI: towards a systems thinking conceptualization,Nabavi E.; Browne C.,2023,10.1057/s41599-023-01579-0,"There is a growing debate amongst academics and practitioners on whether interventions made, thus far, towards Responsible AI have been enough to engage with the root causes of AI problems. Failure to effect meaningful changes in this system could see these initiatives not reach their potential and lead to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their marketing campaigns. Systems thinking is often touted as a methodology to manage and effect change; however, there is little practical advice available for decision-makers to include systems thinking insights to work towards Responsible AI. Using the notion of ‘leverage zones’ adapted from the systems thinking literature, we suggest a novel approach to plan for and experiment with potential initiatives and interventions. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the Five Ps to help practitioners construct and identify holistic interventions that may work towards Responsible AI, from lower-order interventions such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating parameters, through to higher-order interventions such as redefining the system’s foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in the first place. Finally, we reflect on the framework as a scaffold for transdisciplinary question-asking to improve outcomes towards Responsible AI. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Springer Nature,scopus-ai
"AI-powered marketing: What, where, and how?",Kumar V.; Ashraf A.R.; Nadeem W.,2024,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2024.102783,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a disruptive force that has revolutionized industries and changed business practices. The integration of AI has brought numerous benefits to various functional areas within organizations, with marketing experiencing a significant positive impact. AI technologies have empowered marketers with advanced tools and insights, fostering unparalleled efficiency, personalization, and strategic campaign decision-making. Despite these advancements, the scholarly focus on AI's transformative effects on marketing is limited. This research investigates how AI is currently applied across different marketing functions and its potential future evolution and impact on marketing processes. In a rapidly evolving world, businesses must navigate complexity, innovate, and sustain competitive advantages. Grounding our analysis in previous AI marketing literature, we adopt the dynamic capability theoretical lens, emphasizing how organizations adapt and prosper in changing environments. This study highlights six key marketing areas where AI promises transformative effects, aiming to illuminate the path for future marketing innovations and strategies, including AI-driven customer insights, measuring marketing performance, automated marketing strategies, ethical implications, enhancing customer experiences, and growth opportunities with AI Implementation. While recognizing AI as a positive disruptive force, we also highlight its limitations, potential threats to privacy and security, as well as ramifications of biases, misuse, and dissemination of misinformation.

"A theory of multiformat communication: mechanisms, dynamics, and strategies",Moffett J.W.; Folse J.A.G.; Palmatier R.W.,2021,10.1007/s11747-020-00750-2,"Extant communication theories predate the explosion of digital formats and technological advances such as virtual reality, which likely explains their predominant focus on traditional and format-level (e.g., face-to-face, email) rather than digital or characteristic-level (e.g., visual cues, synchronicity) design decisions. Firms thus lack insights into how to create and use emerging digital formats, individually or synergistically. To establish a holistic framework of bilateral multiformat communication for relationship marketing, this article reviews communication theory to establish a foundation for understanding multiformat communication and to identify any gaps (e.g., AI agents, simulated cues). The authors then review bilateral communication research in light of the identified theoretical gaps, to inform their framework. Finally, by decomposing these formats according to six fundamental characteristics, they predict how each characteristic might promote effective, efficient, and experiential communication goals, in light of distinct message, temporal, and dyadic factors. Ultimately, these combined insights reveal an overarching framework, with characteristic-level propositions grouped into five key themes, that can serve as a platform for academics and managers to develop multiformat communication theory and relationship strategies. © 2020, Academy of Marketing Science.",Communication strategy; Multichannel communication; Multiformat communication; Online relationships; Simulated cues,Springer,scopus-ai
Retrieval method as a learning intervention for long term retention and creative thinking skills,Vishnu Vandana V.; Rao A.M.,2024,10.16920/jeet/2024/v37is2/24102,"Few key skills among many that are needed in the 21st century are critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, meta cognitive skills, technology literacy and decision making under uncertainty. With the emergence of ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools, there is a dire need for a distinctive way of learning and application of learning to ensure learning effectiveness. Mere content is no longer the most important factor to learn these skills but. what is needed is the ability to retrieve material learnt, in the context of application. For the learner to be able to apply the critical thinking levels and higher learning levels of Blooms taxonomy, the basic first level of remembering forms the basic foundation, particularly when the students are from first generation educated families or with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. However, when students cram for the exams, they generally get an ‘illusion of learning’, where they think they know, but in reality often they may not be able to recall what they crammed when they need it later. This is a case of inefficient investment of time and effort in learning for the student. For the teacher, it slows down the teaching process and opportunity to engage in higher order thinking level applications. Addressing the frustrations of both teacher and students, the authors applied the concept of Retrieval method for MBA I year for Marketing Management course during a semester and a survey was conducted at the end of the semester to understand the perception of students on effectiveness of Retrieval techniques. The results supported that retrieval techniques were effective in supporting the student learning. © 2023 JEET.",Blooms Taxonomy; Learning intervention; Retention technique; Retrieval Technique,Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology,scopus-ai
A value based approach to management,Kothari A.; Lackner J.,2006,10.1108/08858620610672614,"Purpose: The paper aims to present a three-step approach that enables companies to define and quantify what customers value, systematically deploy their resources to deliver greater value than the competition, and capture a greater share of the value delivered to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Each of the three the three steps in the value creation cycle is examined, and the tools and approaches that leading companies use to maximize shareholder wealth are outlined. Findings: A customer-value based approach to management can help companies instill a fact-based decision-making process in the enterprise. This promotes faster growth through differentiated customer investment. It ensures that the highest return initiatives are prioritized. Enterprises using this disciplined three-step approach will be well positioned to better understand value potential, creating value, delivering value, and managing their market position to maximize the value they capture. Originality/value: Mastering the value cycle enables enterprises to win in both the customer markets and the financial markets. In short, it leads them to long-term profitable growth. Take the example of a commercial printer which had traditionally played in the procure and produce step of the print value chain associated with retail inserts. Retail inserts are one of the primary demand generation vehicles for retailers, who use these to drive store traffic. One retailer saw their store traffic drop by 20 percent over a one-month period after they decided to stop printing inserts. In this value chain print was fast becoming a commodity and, like its competitors, the company was looking for growth strategy amidst declining margins. An analysis of the value chain (see Table AI) revealed that while the print component of the value chain was fast being commoditized, value was pooling at the front of the value chain with the players who delivered the insert to the end customers. The pain experienced by the retailers was so high that they committed to co-developing a solution that would introduce a discontinuity in the value chain and redirect the pooling of value back to other participants of the value chain. The printer managed to escape the commodity trap and position itself towards profitable growth. Ashish Kothari is a Principal with Charter Consulting.

An efficient smart data mining framework based cloud internet of things for developing artificial intelligence of marketing information analysis,Liu Y.; Alzahrani I.R.; Jaleel R.A.; Sulaie S.A.,2023,10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103121,"Because of the big volume of marketing data, a human analyst would be unable to uncover any useful information for marketing that could aid in the process of making decision. Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework is successful, with higher accuracies and good performance. Results revealed that customer service & marketing tactics are essential for a Company’ success & survival. Also, the C4.5 has accomplished better achievement than the SVM, RF, LR, NB, & ID3. At the end, CIoT Platform was evaluated by response time, request rate & processing of bank data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Analysis; Artificial intelligence (AI); CIoT; Data of bank; Marketing; SDM,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-ai
Machine learning and AI in marketing – Connecting computing power to human insights,Ma L.; Sun B.,2020,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.04.005,"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial intelligence (AI); Big data; Digital marketing; Interpretation; Machine learning; Marketing theory; Network; Prediction; Tracking data; Unstructured data,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-ai
An appreciative inquiry into the first export order,Crick D.; Crick J.,2016,10.1108/QMR-01-2015-0001,"Purpose – This study aims to report on an investigation into decision-making leading to a UK firm’s first export order. It demonstrates the application of appreciative inquiry (AI) as an underutilised research method in marketing investigations. Design/methodology/approach – An AI research approach was undertaken in a firm that had not started exporting at the commencement of the study whereby the interventionist approach allowed the management team to overcome negative perceptions in their decision-making. From a research perspective, marketing decision-making could be understood in real time as opposed to in hindsight. Findings – While the key decision-maker is likely to be the owner/manager in small newly internationalising firms, a variety of factors will affect the decision to start exporting including the influence of the management team. In particular, the management team’s perceptions towards a combination of effectuation- and causation-based decision-making where risk/reward considerations in exploiting various international marketing opportunities are undertaken in light of perceived affordable losses, as well as against evolving objectives. Originality/value – The contribution is to demonstrate the AI methodology, which to date has received attention in management domains other than marketing; it offers an interventionist approach to help managers overcome barriers and move positively forward in decision-making. It offers researchers an opportunity to understand marketing decision-making in real time. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Appreciative inquiry; Export; Internationalisation; Marketing,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-ai
Influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on firm performance: the business value of AI-based transformation projects,Wamba-Taguimdje S.-L.; Fosso Wamba S.; Kala Kamdjoug J.R.; Tchatchouang Wanko C.E.,2020,10.1108/BPMJ-10-2019-0411,"Purpose: The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-ai
AI based decision making: combining strategies to improve operational performance,Al-Surmi A.; Bashiri M.; Koliousis I.,2022,10.1080/00207543.2021.1966540,"This study investigates the strategic alignment between marketing and information technology (IT) strategies and provides production and operations decision makers a model for improving operational performance. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the combined strategies were used to develop a novel decision-making framework. The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making.

"A consumer perspective of AI certification – the current certification landscape, consumer approval and directions for future research",Blösser M.; Weihrauch A.,2024,10.1108/EJM-01-2023-0009,"Purpose: In spite of the merits of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and social media, harm to consumers has prompted calls for AI auditing/certification. Understanding consumers’ approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies’ choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media. Findings: Trust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most. Research limitations/implications: The introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars. Practical implications: For businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on “who should certify AI” from a consumer perspective.

Virtual reality’s impact on destination visit intentions and the moderating role of amateur photography,Morrison A.M.; Bag S.; Mandal K.,2024,10.1108/TR-12-2022-0621,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of virtual reality experiences (VREs) and emotions on holiday destination visit intentions by applying the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework. It also examined the role of amateur photography as a moderator in the relationship between VREs, emotions and visit intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were collected through a structured survey questionnaire administered in India, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine relationships among variables. The formal survey was preceded by a pilot study. The partial least squares-SEM product indicator technique was applied to measure the moderation effect of amateur photography. Findings: When people have high levels of positive emotions in the pre-travel stage with VRE participation, their intentions to visit destinations are stronger. Amateur photography moderated the relationships between user interactivity, memorable experiences, mental imagery and visit intentions. No significant moderating effect was found between emotional experiences and visit intentions. Practical implications: The results indicate that creators of virtual reality (VR) communications should concentrate on producing interactive and visually striking VR content, as the research found that VR experiences with tourism-related activities have a significant impact on potential visitor emotions. Therefore, VR producers should incorporate authentic and distinctive elements into contents, giving viewers realistic and trustworthy VR tourism experiences. Destination marketers should evoke emotions in people to increase motivations to visit the VR-presented places. Destination marketers should create VR content with hedonic elements, fostering a connection and desire to visit the destination presented in the VR. For example, destination marketers can enhance the sensory aspects of VR content with audio, video, haptics and artificial intelligence, encouraging people to be emotionally captivated and fully immersed. The findings indicate that amateur photography has a significant moderating effect on prospective tourists’ intentions to visit a place presented in VR. Thus, destination marketers are advised to provide photogenic and relevant content to users. By using amateur photography, destinations can market their attractions to potential visitors in a more interactive and relatable manner. Showcasing images taken by amateur photographers presents a genuine perspective of the offerings, thereby increasing visit intentions among prospective visitors. Additionally, amateur photography helps promote the destination in a positive light, emphasizing the attractions and other offerings, and this encourages potential visitors to consider the destination as a travel option, thereby increasing visit intentions. Encouraging amateur photographers to take and share images also increases their engagement with the destination, creating a sense of community and connection and ultimately driving visit intentions. Destination marketers should embrace VR tourism content as a means of promoting their destinations to potential customers by considering the three crucial elements of memorable experiences, emotional experiences and mental imagery. In essence, destination management organizations and other decision makers should develop complete VR communication plans that incorporate interactive and visually striking activities. This can be done by creating VR experiences for prospective tourists, which will enable them to pick their preferred destinations at the pre-travel stage. Through this approach, an effective destination marketing strategy can be established. Originality/value: This research has value in making several potential contributions to the tourism applications of VR. It is the first study to use and test the S-O-R framework to analyse tourist behaviour from the perspective of emotions generated by VR applications. The analysis focuses on India’s tourism market, which has not been explored much in the context of VR and from the perspective of a developing country. The research emphasizes the use of VR as a tool to understand tourist behaviour rather than just focusing on visit intentions. The findings provide valuable insights into the importance of VR in tourism. The knowledge generated will contribute to the understanding of the impact of VR experiences on emotions and visit intentions and the moderating effect of amateur photography. It has practical implications for destination marketers in developing effective marketing strategies that enhance tourists’ emotions and motivate visit intentions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Amateur photography; Emotional experiences; Holiday destinations; S-O-R framework; Structural equation modelling; Virtual reality experiences; Visit intentions,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence
Classification of potential electric vehicle purchasers: A machine learning approach,Bas J.; Cirillo C.; Cherchi E.,2021,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120759,"Among the many approaches towards fuel economy, the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) may have the greatest impact. However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021",Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-artificial intelligence
An explainable recommendation framework based on an improved knowledge graph attention network with massive volumes of side information,Shimizu R.; Matsutani M.; Goto M.,2022,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107970,"In recent years, explainable recommendation has been a topic of active study. This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model. Finally, a multifaceted analysis suggests that the proposed framework is not only effective as an explainable recommendation model but also provides a powerful tool for planning various marketing strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Model-intrinsic approach,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence
Defining an Integrated and Computed Methodology Approach for Sentiment and Psychographic Analysis in Tourism Research,Izzo F.; Picone Q.,2022,10.29036/jots.v13i25.393,"High-performance computational resources and artificial intelligence-based tools can enhance tourism research and marketing. However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques. The main contribution of this research effort is twofold: the definition of a general-purpose BFF/Sentiment Analysis methodology and the development of a prediction model from online UGC based on the Big Five personality traits in the tourism research scenario. © 2022 Ikenga.

UNIFYING ALGORITHMIC AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES: EMOTIONS IN ONLINE REVIEWS AND SALES,Yu Y.; Yang Y.; Huang J.; Tan Y.,2023,10.25300/MISQ/2022/16600,"Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

Organizational frontlines in the digital age: The Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework,van Doorn J.; Smailhodzic E.; Puntoni S.; Li J.; Schumann J.H.; Holthöwer J.,2023,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114000,"While organizational frontlines in the digital age involve complex interactions between consumers, autonomous technology (AT), and frontline workers, research so far largely focuses on the effect of AT on either the consumer or the worker. Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-artificial intelligence
Exploring the generational influence on social media-based tourist decision-making in India,Gulati S.,2024,10.1108/IDD-11-2022-0115,"Purpose: This study aims to explore how social media affects decision-making among tourists and whether there is a potential effect of age, which is studied through generations. For this purpose, baby boomers, Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z tourists are studied and real-time implications are offered. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a descriptive and exploratory design where the conceptual model of social media-based decision-making is developed through a review of the literature. Quantitative analysis is conducted on primary data from 600 Indian tourists. This is done using a self-administered questionnaire adopted from Gulati (2022) after checking its validity and reliability. The statistical analysis for hypothesis testing is done using PLS-SEM path modelling on pooled data. To study the categorical moderating effect of generations, partial least squares multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA) is performed as a paired comparison on every successive generation. Findings: After testing every successive younger generation with an older generation through PLS-MGA, none of the pairs found any significant differences in path coefficients, as the values obtained were 0.05 < p < 0.95 for all five paths (SM → NR, SM → IS, SM → E, SM → P, SM → PPB). This indicates all the generations behave in a similar manner irrespective of them being older or younger, and age does not moderate social media’s impact on decision-making among Indian tourists. Research limitations/implications: The study establishes India as a unique geographical market and suggests tourism marketers to treat all generations at par, irrespective of age, as they behave and interact with social media in a similar manner. But, because this study is restricted to a single geographical location, i.e. India, further regions can be explored for global generalisation. Future research can also explore other demographics for combined, moderated analysis. Findings from the study suggest that marketers should ensure that equal attention is given to all generations as they engage with social media in a similar manner. Targeted marketing using artificial intelligence can help in ensuring custom ads. Personalisation according to generations can also facilitate greater purchases. Originality/value: The study fills a major population and knowledge gap by exploring a topic that has been highly under-researched. Also, the study adopts an inclusive approach by analysing all the generations, both younger and older, to understand the potential effect of age on moderating the impact that social media has on tourist decision-making. Further, real-time suggestions and implications are offered to tourism marketers with special reference to the Indian tourism industry. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Generations; India; Social media; Tourist decision-making; User generated content,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence
Two Brothers Organic Farms: building shared value in a competitive market,Laddha S.; Bose V.,2024,10.1108/EEMCS-10-2023-0416,"Learning outcomes: After completion of the case study, students will be able to understand organic farming challenges in India, analyze Two Brothers Organic Farms’ (TBOF) value chain for creating shared values, evaluate marketing mix and product development strategies, explore social media’s impact on marketing and explore and propose strategies for long-term sustainability in the organic farming industry. Case overview/synopsis: The case study revolves around the entrepreneurial journey of Ajinkya and Satyajit Hange, two brothers who transitioned from successful banking careers to pursue their passion for organic farming. Establishing TBOF in Pune, India, the duo faced challenges in introducing organic produce to a market resistant to change. With a commitment to regenerative agriculture, they implemented innovative farming practices, including desi cow rearing, multicropping and indigenous seeds. The narrative unfolds the brothers’ strategic roles, where Ajinkya manages crop production, and Satyajit focuses on marketing. Emphasizing a trusted brand built on quality, they expanded their product portfolio (Figure 2), reaching 52 countries through direct marketing and word of mouth. As the organic food industry surged postpandemic, TBPF faced challenges in meeting rising demand. The case study discusses the organic farming sector in India, underscoring the brothers’ efforts to combat harmful agro-inputs. The dilemmas lie in navigating the niche organic market, supply–demand imbalances and the need for sustainable business processes. The case study aims to explore the strategic decisions and dilemmas encountered by TBOF, offering insights into the complexities of sustainable entrepreneurship in the Indian organic farming sector.

The role of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in encouraging low- versus high-cost pro-environmental behaviors,Wan C.; Lee D.; Ng P.,2024,10.1002/mar.22013,"Virtual influencers have great potential to shape the audience's perception and motivate behavioral change. Drawing upon anthropomorphism theory and social identity theory, this paper examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in shaping audiences' trust and subsequently pro-environmental behaviors in low- and high-cost contexts. Two online studies employing experimental materials generated by artificial intelligence were conducted. Study 1 revealed that high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) and high racial homophily (local-like virtual influencers) are more effective for eliciting trust in the context of low-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) would further weaken the trust level of a virtual influencer in low anthropomorphism (animate-like virtual influencers). Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in the context of high-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) enhanced the trust in a high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) virtual influencer. The moderated mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. This research advanced our understanding on the moderating role of racial homophily that serves as a cognitive shortcut for low-cost and quick decisions. However, a low racial homophily (foreign-like) virtual influencer would be more effective for high-cost and symbolic pro-environmental behaviors. These insights provide valuable guidance to businesses, marketers, and environmental advocates aiming to leverage virtual influencers for encouraging sustainability practices. © 2024 The Authors.

Cross-Platform Analysis of Seller Performance and Churn for Ecommerce Using Artificial Intelligence,Batta A.; Kar A.K.; Satpathy S.,2023,10.4018/JGIM.322439,"Suppliers and sellers play a crucial role in the ecommerce ecosystem. Sellers and ecommerce firms use social media to increase user engagement, visibility, and sales. Seller ratings are as important as the product ratings on ecommerce platforms to drive buying decisions. Based on sellers’ actions on social media, this study examines seller turnover and disengagement on e-commerce platforms. The study has been supported by the justice theory. Seller reviews and ratings from e-commerce platforms and conversations from social media platforms have been gathered. Using natural language processing, machine learning, partial least squares (PLS) path analysis, and statistical inferences, objectives of the study are met. The study offers recommendations for both practitioners and researchers. The sellers must focus more on interaction and communication than marketing. Through a longitudinal analysis, the study also establishes that ecommerce organizations can use seller social media performance as a predictor of future seller churn and disengagement so they can take the necessary remedial action. © 2023 IGI Global.

The impact of marketing modification on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana,Abrokwah-Larbi K.; Awuku-Larbi Y.,2024,10.1108/JRME-01-2022-0010,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the effect of marketing modification on business performance from the perspective of marketing capabilities theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) – path analysis. Findings: According to the study’s findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: This current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implications: The outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implications: The application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/value: The study’s findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP). In terms of contribution, this study adds to the body of knowledge already available on marketing modification and business performance, particularly in the setting of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business performance; Food processing SMEs; Ghana; Marketing modification,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence

Complementing human effort in online reviews: A deep learning approach to automatic content generation and review synthesis,Carlson K.; Kopalle P.K.; Riddell A.; Rockmore D.; Vana P.,2023,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.02.004,"Online product reviews are ubiquitous and helpful sources of information available to consumers for making purchase decisions. Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research. © 2022",Artificial intelligence; Automation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Online reviews; Review synthesis; Wine reviews,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence

Dark sides of artificial intelligence: The dangers of automated decision-making in search engine advertising,Schultz C.D.; Koch C.; Olbrich R.,2024,10.1002/asi.24798,"With the growing use of artificial intelligence, search engine providers are increasingly pushing advertisers to use automated bidding strategies based on machine learning. Such automated decision-making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision-making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long-term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference-in-differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self-regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision-making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps. © 2023 The Authors.

Time for marketing to embrace reinforcement learning,Murphy L.; Perales F.; Gopal A.; Gyurdieva Y.; Gueorguiev V.; Shandilya P.,2022,,"Since COVID-19 upended the world, marketers can no longer rely on historical data to inform their decisions. Channel splits have changed and online conversations have exploded. Marketing budgets have decreased as a percentage of revenue, meaning marketing funds must be used more effectively and efficiently than ever. Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers.

TO BOAST OR NOT TO BOAST: THE IMPACT OF ADVERTISING THE USE OF AUTONOMOUS ALGORITHMS TO BANK AND HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES; [HVALITI SE ILI NE: UTJECAJ OGLAŠAVANJA UPOTREBE AUTONOMNIH ALGORITAMA NA KUPCE I ZAPOSLENIKE BANAKA I BOLNICA],Modliński A.,2024,10.30924/mjcmi.29.1.5,"In the current phase of artificial intelligence development, more and more attention is being paid to technologies that make autonomous decisions. Little attention has been paid to the customers’ and job seekers’ perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers’ attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers’ intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital’s unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies. The topic is worth exploring as key market players (such as Oracle) recognize autonomous technologies as the most ground-breaking innovation that will shape business in the coming years. © 2024, University of Split - Faculty of Economics.

Effects of influential factors and their interactions in information processing strategy adoption: The perspective from dual process theory,Liqiang H.; Kanliang W.,2021,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2021.06.001,"In the past decades, researchers in various areas of social and cognitive psychology have developed dual process theories of information processing. Although these theories differ on a variety of dimensions, including domains of application and specific definitions, they all share the basic assumption that two different modes of information processing operate in making judgments, decisions as well as in solving problems. In essence, the common distinction in dual process modes is between a fast, associative information process mode with low effort heuristics, and a slow, rule-based mode with high effort systematic process. On the basis of a brief theoretical development introduction, we illustrate how the dual process theory is manifested in various disciplines. Table 1 summarizes the different representations of dual process, including heuristic vs. systematic; peripheral route vs. central route; associative access vs. attitude construct; categorization vs. individuation; automatic contextual influences vs. correction; experiential vs. rational; impulsive vs. reflective; implicit vs. explicit. Later on, we discuss how different types of information processing modes are determined and what the main factors that may significantly influence information processing adoption. Several determinants are identified froma review of the extant literature; for instance, the involvement would be an influential factor that affects what type of information processing mode adopted. Specifically, if an information processor does not have a high level of involvement, it would be more likely of him / her to adopt a heuristic mode comparing with a systematic mode. Similarly, if a consumer does not in a focal status of high motivation, comparing with the one with a high level of motivation, he/ she would be more likely to adopt a heuristic mode. The related factors that are generally discussed in previous studied are shown in Table 2. Although we may learn that these factors as listed are playing significant roles in influencing what type of information processing mode adopted, little has been discussed in prior research in relation to the possible interaction effects that would play a role. In particular, we could conjecture that a higher level of motivation of information processor would be more likely to adopt systematic information processing mode, but what would be happen if the information processor does not have a higher level of ability to process the information in order to make a judgment or decision? Will the information processor adopt systematic mode or heuristic mode? Moreover, when we try to take the risk as an important factor into consideration, if the decision context is with a high risk, will the information processor adopt systematic processing mode even if he/ she does not have the ability to process related information? Whether the processor would adopt heuristic processing mode when he / she does not have the ability to process? This calls for future research to further explore more rich findings and interesting underlying mechanisms. The exploration of the impacts aroused by various influential factors would be a bright future. Future research could be extended on the basis of the current theory at least from the following three facets. First, the exploration of the theory application. As we discussed above, most of previous studies emphasize on investigating the independent effect of individual factor on information processing mode adoption, while little has been discussed on the underlying effects aroused by interactive factors in various contexts. Take the online product review context-a hot topic studied in information systems, marketing, as well as electronic commerce disciplines-as an example, our review of recent studies shows that although the dual process theories have been widely applied to examine the effects of online product reviews, or the review helpfulness itself, there is scant research regarding what factors that really determine which type of information processing mode used, and whether the information processing mode would be dynamically caused by various interactive factors. On the basis of the analysis of our paper which argues that the determinant factors that would be interactive in affecting the information processing mode, related future research with respect to this area could be widely extended. As regard to the research methodology in examining the focal theory, secondly, we call for more advanced method which could be used in future research in order to explore more interesting findings. Particularly, the current studies in relation to the dual process theories largely focus on experimental method or survey, while few attentions have been paid by using behavioral data to deduce what type of information processing mode being used. Based on the research logic presented by recent seminal papers such as Gladstone et al., Stachl et al. and Wu et al., we think it is feasible to extend the method scope to examine this theory. In addition, third, with respect to the extension of the theory itself, in line the recent arguments of seminal papers published on Nature (Rahwan et al.) and California Management Review (Huang et al., we may conjecture that the dual process theory could be extended in the new artificial intelligence era. In particular, during the interaction between human and robot (artificial intelligence), it is imperative to understand whether the robot, cognitively, will use these two different types of processing modes in their information processing like human? How would the robot be in the eye of human when the brain becomes to integrate with robot? Will the robot be the third processing mode complementing with the original two processing mode? Or will the robot interrupt the original two processing modes? Or will the robot replace the one type of either processing mode? We call for future research to further explore the bright and interesting area to explore the effects of interaction between human and robot. © 2021.

Overcoming the pitfalls and perils of algorithms: A classification of machine learning biases and mitigation methods,van Giffen B.; Herhausen D.; Fahse T.,2022,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.01.076,"Over the last decade, the importance of machine learning increased dramatically in business and marketing. However, when machine learning is used for decision-making, bias rooted in unrepresentative datasets, inadequate models, weak algorithm designs, or human stereotypes can lead to low performance and unfair decisions, resulting in financial, social, and reputational losses. This paper offers a systematic, interdisciplinary literature review of machine learning biases as well as methods to avoid and mitigate these biases. We identified eight distinct machine learning biases, summarized these biases in the cross-industry standard process for data mining to account for all phases of machine learning projects, and outline twenty-four mitigation methods. We further contextualize these biases in a real-world case study and illustrate adequate mitigation strategies. These insights synthesize the literature on machine learning biases in a concise manner and point to the importance of human judgment for machine learning algorithms. © 2022 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Bias; Case study; Machine learning; Mitigation methods,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-artificial intelligence
Forecasting the Behavior of Target Segments to Activate Advertising Tools: Case of Mobile Operator Vodafone Ukraine,Zatonatska T.; Dluhopolskyi O.; Artyukh T.; Tymchenko K.,2022,10.2478/eoik-2022-0005,"Today, the use of machine learning technology in combination with the use of big data are topics that are actively discussed in business around the world. This topic has long gone beyond the information sphere, as it now applies to almost every sphere of life: economic, telecommunications, education, medicine, administration, and especially defense. Predicting customer behavior based on scoring models is in its infancy in Ukrainian companies, the main ones being the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning, which will be the leading catalyst that will facilitate decision-making in business in the nearest future. The aim of the study is to develop a scoring model that predicts the behavior of target segments, namely, updating their activity to activate advertising tools. To achieve the goal of the work a set of research methods was used: dialectical-to reveal the theoretical foundations of models and types of forecasting models; analytical-in the study of the functioning of the environment SAS, Anaconda; optimization methods-to choose the best model and generate features. Scientific novelty and theoretical significance lie in the development of a scoring model for predicting the activity of subscribers of the telecommunications company ""VF Ukraine"", on the basis of which marketing campaigns are conducted. With the help of the built-in scoring model, the company ""VF Ukraine""can target its campaigns to retain subscribers. The marketing directorate of the enterprise can choose the TOP-20 or TOP-30 of the most prone subscribers to non-resumption of activity, i.e., tend to switch to other mobile operators, and hold promotions for them-providing additional gifts and bonuses, money to mobile account.  © 2022 Tetiana Zatonatska et al., published by Sciendo.",advertising; big data; market segment; scoring models; target; telecommunication sector,Sciendo,scopus-artificial intelligence

The effect of supply chain finance on sustainability performance: empirical analysis and fsQCA,Wang S.; Yu H.; Wei M.,2023,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,"Purpose: In the context of global economic downturn and intense competition, firms are increasingly resorting to supply chains to acquire capital support and achieve sustainability. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP – namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) – the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF’s effects on CSP. Findings: The authors find that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP’s positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF’s promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implications: This study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF’s effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF’s role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain – namely, core firm–suppliers and core firm–customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implications: First, our findings indicate that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to “do good.” The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/value: This study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm’s competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Environmental; Financial performance; Recipe; social and governance performance; Supply chain finance; Sustainability performance,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence
Practice papers ChatGPT and search engine optimisation: The future is here,Cutler K.,2023,,"The new chatbot from artificial intelligence company OpenAI, called ChatGPT, has grown aggressively since its launch in late 2022. ChatGPT provides information back to users who populate questions in a clear and easy to understand structure. This technology can be used for different purposes, including writing code, creating business proposals, writing stories and answering complex questions. Because this technology is considered a breakthrough in terms of its ability to process natural language, it stands to reason that it could have future effects on the fundamental digital marketing tactic known as search engine optimisation (SEO), a process by which websites are developed and updated with the goal of increasing natural ranking, traffic and customers from search engines like Google and Bing. For the past 20 years, people have turned to search engines for information, news articles, images, videos and answers to questions both mundane and complex. This technological advance with chatbots could indicate a significant general shift for marketers, specifically related to web searches and how marketers think about SEO. In fact, Microsoft’s decision to invest in ChatGPT and include it within their search engine, Bing, has already created waves in the search engine ecosystems. In this paper, ChatGPT will be examined, its capabilities and how they could affect search marketing and SEO. © Henry Stewart Publications.",chat bots; ChatGPT; digital marketing; search engine marketing; search engine optimisation; search marketing; SEO,Henry Stewart Publications,scopus-artificial intelligence
The paradox of technology: Negativity bias in consumer adoption of innovative technologies,Frank D.-A.; Chrysochou P.; Mitkidis P.,2023,10.1002/mar.21740,"Innovative technologies often feature inherently conflicting properties. This poses a challenge for marketers because negative properties not only weigh heavily on consumers' technology adoption decisions but potentially do more so than positive ones. To shed light on the paradox of technology and its underlying processes, the present research develops a conceptual model drawing on technology adoption and valence perception theories about the prevalence of negativity bias in consumers' technology adoption decisions with its unique effect through the serial chain of consumers' perceptions of risk and trust regarding the technology. Results of three studies (N = 1309) demonstrate that the effect of negative valence consistently outperforms that of positive valence in consumers' technology adoption intentions (Studies 1–2) and decisions (Study 3). Furthermore, results show that the disproportionate effect of negative (vs. positive) valence can be explained by the proposed serial causal chain through consumers' perception of risk of the technology and trust in the technology (Studies 2–3) while ruling out company trust and consumer knowledge as alternative drivers of the effects (Study 3). These findings contribute to the pertinent literature on consumer psychology in decisions to adopt novel technologies in that they quantify and explain the potential outcome stemming from the ambiguous properties of novel technology. Moreover, this study finds negativity bias to be an often overlooked consumer bias with implications for marketing practice and useful for understanding and lowering resistance towards artificial intelligence technology. © 2022 The Authors.

The consumer decision journey: A literature review of the foundational models and theories and a future perspective,Santos S.; Gonçalves H.M.,2021,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121117,"The consumer decision journey model has become increasingly important to understand consumer decision-making processes. Although the term originally emerged with Court et al. in 2009, the various current perspectives of the consumer journey suggest the existence of distinct literature and theoretical roots that have yet to be fully explored in detail. The objective of the paper is to semi-systematically review the main theories and models that constitute the foundation on which the consumer journey has evolved. Furthermore, given the lack of academic studies reflecting on the influence of more recent technologies based on artificial intelligence on the consumer journey, this study aims to fill this gap in an attempt to mold further theory development around the consumer journey concept. 74 relevant papers were retrieved mainly from a detailed search on SCOPUS, as well as a backward and forward citation analysis. A thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three literature streams that contribute to the consumer journey literature. This represents a furthering of the theoretical knowledge regarding the consumer journey and its foundations. By also discussing a future perspective, a holistic and comprehensive basis is provided to structure and assist how marketing managers can perceive the consumer decision journey. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Classical consumer behavior models; Consumer decision journey; Decision analysis; Hierarchy of effects; Semi-systematic literature review,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-artificial intelligence

What Drives Consumers’ Decisions to Use Intelligent Agent Technologies? A Systematic Review,Sidlauskiene J.,2022,10.1080/15332861.2021.1961192,"As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it will increasingly empower the successful use of intelligent agent (IA) technologies in marketing practices. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer’s perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers’ intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Antecedents; artificial intelligence; intelligent agent technologies; representation theory; systematic literature review; technology acceptance,Routledge,scopus-artificial intelligence
A Machine Learning Framework towards Bank Telemarketing Prediction,Tékouabou S.C.K.; Gherghina Ş.C.; Toulni H.; Mata P.N.; Mata M.N.; Martins J.M.,2022,10.3390/jrfm15060269,"The use of machine learning (ML) methods has been widely discussed for over a decade. The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

Over a decade of social opinion mining: a systematic review,Cortis K.; Davis B.,2021,10.1007/s10462-021-10030-2,"Social media popularity and importance is on the increase due to people using it for various types of social interaction across multiple channels. This systematic review focuses on the evolving research area of Social Opinion Mining, tasked with the identification of multiple opinion dimensions, such as subjectivity, sentiment polarity, emotion, affect, sarcasm and irony, from user-generated content represented across multiple social media platforms and in various media formats, like text, image, video and audio. Through Social Opinion Mining, natural language can be understood in terms of the different opinion dimensions, as expressed by humans.

A multi-criteria intelligence aid approach to selecting strategic key opinion leaders in digital business management,Lam H.Y.; Tang V.; Wu C.H.; Cho V.,2024,10.1016/j.jik.2024.100502,"In the wake of the global disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, digital channels have emerged as a significant driver of business sales. As such, the value of digital business management has received considerable attention from industrial practitioners. Beyond conventional promotion techniques, collaboration with digital market influencers has shown significant potential for business organisations by creating a circle of trust. However, managing influencers in the business-to-business market is far more complex than in business-to-consumer markets, as it involves balancing business processes, competitive advantages, company image and risks rather than solely motivating customer engagement. It is, therefore, critical for organisations to carefully select key opinion leaders (KOLs). To address this challenge, this study introduces an intelligent multi-criteria KOL analytics framework that embeds the fuzzy best-worst method and the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. The framework converts subjective and linguistic criteria, determines the attribute most relevant to the business, and then selects the most suitable KOLs for the campaign. A case study was conducted in partnership with a digital marketing agency in Hong Kong to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this approach. This model facilitates the evolution of digital business management by systematically identifying and assessing KOLs, contributing to significant changes in the digital business environment for companies. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Business-to-business; Digital business management; Key opinion leaders; Multi-criteria decision-making,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence
Toward a decision-making system based on artificial intelligence for precision marketing: A case study of Morocco,El Koufi N.; Belangour A.; sadiq M.,2024,10.1016/j.joitmc.2024.100250,"The insurance sector plays a crucial role in fostering sustainable economic development within a country. As the customer base grows, insurance companies must prioritize transitioning to data-driven strategies to cut costs and make more informed marketing choices in today's digital era. This study proposes a new decision-making framework for precision marketing, based on a real case study from a Moroccan insurance company that aims to solve a practical problem. The proposed decision-making system consists of four components, with each component involving important steps. Firstly, data preparation was performed, consisting of four critical stages: data acquisition, data cleaning and filtering, feature selection, and oversampling. Secondly, top 20% and top 50% consumers are taken as examples to present their customer persona in detail. Based on the processed data, we analysed consumer consumption behaviors using four ML algorithms and made a performance comparison of the four algorithms. Additionally, we conducted feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features and evaluate the system's performance. The aim of the proposed precision decision-making system is to assist managers in discerning the distinctive characteristics of potential customers and proposing tailored precision marketing strategies. This approach is expected to substantially reduce advertising expenses and enhance overall marketing efficiency.

Does the belief of farmers on land as God influence the adoption of smart farming technologies?,Vasan M.; Yoganandan G.,2023,10.1108/BIJ-10-2022-0645,"Purpose: Artificial Intelligence-based smart farming technologies have brought impressive changes in farming. This paper aims at exploring the farmers’ intention to adopt smart farming technologies (SFT). Also, the authors intend to know how far the belief of farmers on land as God influences their decision to adopt SFT. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from 500 farmers chosen purposively. A well-crafted survey instrument was employed to amass data from farmers for measuring their adoption of SFT. As the authors sought to measure the farmers’ behavioural intention (BI) towards the adoption of SFT, the technology acceptance model developed by Davis (1989) came in handy, including perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and BI. The authors have adopted this model as it was considered a superior model. The items on the attitude of confidence (AC) were adapted from Adrian et al. (2005). Survey instruments of Thompson and Higgins (1991) and Compeau and Higgins (1995) were also referred to finalize the statements relating to attitude towards use. Moreover, the authors developed items relating to the perceived belief of land as God based on frequent interaction with the farmers. Findings: The study results divulged that attitude to use (AU) is directly influenced by the rural farmers’ PU, PEU and AC. Similarly, this investigation has observed behaviour intention directly influenced by the AU of farmers. It is observed that AU was the most influential variable, which ultimately influenced the BI to use SFT. Research limitations/implications: This study has an important limitation in the form of representing only the culture, belief and value system of farmers in India. Practical implications: The outcome of this study will facilitate the policymakers to draw suitable policy measures keeping the sensitivities of the farmers in mind in their technology adoption drive. The agricultural officers can encourage farmers to take logical decisions by supplying adequate information in a time-bound manner. Marketers can make suitable adjustments in their sales and promotion activities that focus on farmers. Social implications: The belief of farmers on land as God has a small yet unmissable influence on farmers’ AU and BI in their technology adoption decision. Based on the above evidence, the authors recommend that marketers fine-tune their product design, product packaging and promotional activities keeping the belief and sensitivities of farmers at the core of their marketing campaign. Originality/value: This article provides original insights by demonstrating the positive influence of PU, PEU and AC on technology adoption by farmers. This research is the first of a kind linking the belief of farmers on land as God with smart farming technology adoption in farming. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agriculture; Land as God; Rural farmers; Smart farming technologies; Structural equation modelling; TAM; Technology adoption,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence

“Humanized Robots”: A Proposition of Categories to Understand Virtual Influencers,da Silva Oliveira A.B.; Chimenti P.,2021,10.3127/ajis.v25i0.3223,"Worldwide investments in influencer marketing are growing and could reach US$ 101 billion in 2020. But how can the brands shield themselves from scandals and other limitations of human influencers? The solution for many companies has involved robots. Virtual influencers (VI) are virtual robots that can emulate human appearance and behaviour and have become a trend in marketing. This study analyses how non-human influencers affect marketing communication by adopting two methods that are unpublished in the investigation of this phenomenon: a systematic literature review and netnography in conjunction with in-depth interviews with specialists resulting in the study identifying five categories (two of which are unpublished and unexplored in the literature) that can facilitate management decisions and also future studies around VIs: anthropomorphism/humanization, attractiveness, authenticity, scalability, and controllability. This study also identified more convergences than divergences between the virtual and the real and between humans and non-humans, generating challenges, opportunities, and guidelines for future research and for assisting management in making decisions concerning digital marketing. © 2021, Australasian Journal of Information Systems.",artificial intelligence; digital marketing; exploratory study; robots; virtual influencers; virtualization,Australasian Association for Information Systems,scopus-artificial intelligence
The connected consumer: Connected devices and the evolution of customer intelligence,Cooke A.D.J.; Zubcsek P.P.,2017,10.1086/690941,"Technological advances are increasing the connections between customers and companies, products, and one another. Consumers’ use of connected devices is providing rich sources of data about consumers, their activity, and their environment, which we collectively label customer intelligence. At the same time, changes in statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence are making automated inferences and decisions regarding consumer behavior possible. One likely result of these changes is the emergence of companies that are especially adept at generating and using customer intelligence. This article explores how changes in sensing technology, causal modeling, and intelligent marketing platforms may affect the generation and utilization of customer intelligence. We envision a merging of these tradition-ally separate activities in companies that possess a large, active customer base and the ability to collect, process, and apply data from these customers quickly and accurately. Such a convergence offers substantial potential value but also notable risk for tomorrow’s connected consumers. © 2017 the Association for Consumer Research.

User generated content: The use of blogs for tourism organisations and tourism consumers,Akehurst G.,2009,10.1007/s11628-008-0054-2,"As the World Wide Web has developed considerable bargaining power has been transferred from suppliers to consumers; there is a real need to improve market intelligence and market research for private and public tourism organisations and facilitate timely consumer decision making. This article explores the development of user generated content and specifically the use of web logs or blogs. Tourism organisations cannot afford to ignore the development of user generated content, peer-to-peer web applications and virtual communities. A recent survey found that consumers trusted more websites with reviews than professional guides and travel agencies and far from being an irrelevance, blogs are often perceived to be more credible and trustworthy than traditional marketing communications. But there is a problem: given the sheer number of possibly relevant travel blogs there is a need to locate, extract and interpret blog content and this has proven so far to be time consuming, exhausting and costly, thus negating the relative value of the information obtained. A way forward may be the use of artificial intelligence and ""opinion mining"" or a blog visualisation system.",Blogs; Internet; Marketing; Tourism; Travel; User generated content,,scopus-artificial intelligence
A dynamic decision support system to predict the value of customer for new product development,Chan S.L.; Ip W.H.,2011,10.1016/j.dss.2011.07.002,"In recent years, firms have focused on how to enter markets and meet customer requirements by improving product attributes and processes to boost their market share and profits. Consequently, market-driven product design and development has become a popular topic in the literature. However, past research neither covers all of the major influencing factors that together drive customers to make purchase decisions, nor connects these various influencing factors to customer purchasing behavior. Past studies further fail to take the time value of money and customer value into consideration. This study proposes a decision support system to (a) predict customer purchasing behavior given certain product, customer, and marketing influencing factors, and (b) estimate the net customer lifetime value from customer purchasing behavior toward a specific product. This will not only enable decision-makers to compare alternatives and select competitive products to launch on the market, but will also improve the understanding of customer behavior toward particular products for the formulation of effective marketing strategies that increase customer loyalty and generate greater profits in the long term. Decision-makers can also make use of the system to build up confidence in new product development in terms of idea generation and product improvement. The application of the proposed system is illustrated and confirmed to be sensible and convincing through a case study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"New approaches to psychographic consumer segmentation: Exploring fine art collectors using artificial intelligence, automated text analysis and correspondence analysis",Pitt C.S.; Bal A.S.; Plangger K.,2020,10.1108/EJM-01-2019-0083,"Purpose: While the motivation for collecting art has received considerable attention in the literature, less is known about the characteristics of the typical art collector. This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating the “doubling” procedure to deal with percentile data. Practical implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of art collectors that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating a non-traditional application of correspondence analysis using the “doubling” procedure. Buyer behavior in the fine art market is not exhaustively studied. By understanding the personality traits of consumers in the art market, sales forces can better provide assistance and product to consumers. Further, understanding the personalities of consumers is better for art retail spaces to better serve consumers.

It shows how text data can be used to identify measurable market segments for which targeted strategies can be developed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Art collectors; Artificial intelligence; Automated text analysis; Correspondence analysis; Psychographic consumer segmentation; Psychographic segmentation; Quantitative analysis of qualitative data,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-artificial intelligence
A model-based decision support system for locating banks,Min H.,1989,10.1016/0378-7206(89)90044-X,"The proper location of branch-banks is critical to the success of the banking business. The major ingredients for deciding where to locate branch-banks are: growth rates of deposits and loans; degree of competition; easy accessibility, and operating costs of potential sites. These are often highly sensitive to socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that are ill-defined and fuzzy in nature. Accordingly, the traditional normative approach alone cannot analyze the excessive location-related data associated with the external factors and cannot appropriately evaluate behavioral criteria for branch-bank sites. In order to overcome these difficulties, this paper develops an interactive fuzzy goal programming model embedded within a locational decision support system for branch-banks. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model-based DSS, it has been applied to establish real-world-like location scenarios for commercial branch-banks in Columbus, Ohio. © 1989.",Decision support systems; Fuzzy multicriteria decision making; Retail location,,scopus-artificial intelligence
A decision support system for a third-party coordinator managing supply chain with demand uncertainty,Banerjee S.; Golhar D.Y.,2013,10.1080/09537287.2011.639586,"Global supply chains reduce cost but increase lead times, complexities and uncertainties. Retailers in consumer products industry are getting shorter lead time to respond to market demand. To meet this challenge, many rely on third party supply chain managers (SCMs) for economically supplying required quantities of finished products quickly. However, due to shorter time to market, the SCM has to procure raw materials and start production process based on expected demand. Since SCM absorbs financial penalties associated with under-and over-estimation of demand from retailer, finding an optimal production lot size and product customisation strategy are essential to an SCM's operation. We develop a profit maximisation model and provide a close-form solution that allows an SCM to calculate optimal production lot size. The model is used to examine profitability of postponing product customisation. Finally, the effect of demand variation on SCM's profitability is explored. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",customisation postponement; decision support system; demand uncertainty; supply chain manager,,scopus-artificial intelligence

This article introduces the social customer journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by explicitly integrating the important role that social others play throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of “traveling companions,” who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages.

Towards ubiquitous information supply for individual investors: A decision support system design,Muntermann J.,2009,10.1016/j.dss.2009.01.003,"This paper introduces an IT artifact called MoFiN DSS that comprises hard- and software components that provide the basis for a prototype of a financial decision support system (DSS) to support individual investors reacting to unforeseen market events. We have derived our motivation for building such a system design from behavioral finance research. Analyses of the behavior of individual investors provide evidence that this segment does react more significantly to any public news published compared to institutional investors. On the other hand, the analyses show that they react significantly slower than their institutional counterparts. Since empirical intraday event study analyses show that capital markets react promptly to new information and that excess returns decrease over a specific period of time, individual investors miss significant trading opportunities due to their current strategies of information research. We address the problem that this market segment is not able to continuously observe diverse information channels and to assess all the new information available. Our prototype decision support system continuously observes company announcements and forecasts their potential impact on the corresponding stock price. After identifying those events for which significant market reactions can be expected, wireless push-based message services provide the technical basis for prompt and location-independent information supply. Based on a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology we have developed, we demonstrate and quantify the advantages that the developed system provides to the individual investors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Models for the design and operation of digital educational environments,Solovov A.V.; Menshikova A.A.,2021,10.31992/0869-3617-2021-30-1-144-155,"Many educational institutions, assessing their prospects, plan to develop distance educational services using their own electronic and information educational environments (EIEE). During creating and operating EIEE of educational institution (EI), a number of questions arise related to structural, marketing, personnel and other decisions. The purpose of this article is to research the organizational, technical and didactic aspects of the EIEE EI. The methodology of the research is based on methods of system analysis, cybernetics, pedagogical psychology and didacticism. A conceptual model of the EIEE EI as an organizational and technical system has been proposed. It includes a marketing subsystem, a set of technical tools, various types of security and an organizational subsystem. The main functions of these subsystems and their various components have been identified. A didactic model of a typical complex of digital educational resources has been developed. Within this model, the diversity of digital educational resources across each academic discipline is integrated into complexes that provide a complete study at different target levels of assimilation, from initial acquaintance to solving uncharacteristic professionally oriented tasks. From the point of view of pedagogical psychology and cybernetics, the high importance of feedback in EIEE EI is shown. The classification of feedbacks (internal and external) is proposed for the triad ""Teacher - Teaching Program - Learner"". The limits of the use of automation in the formation of feedbacks are specified, as opposed to other (non-computer) responses to students' educational activities.

Community-based influence maximization in social networks under a competitive linear threshold model,Bozorgi A.; Samet S.; Kwisthout J.; Wareham T.,2017,10.1016/j.knosys.2017.07.029,"The main purpose in influence maximization, which is motivated by the idea of viral marketing in social networks, is to find a subset of key users that maximize influence spread under a certain propagation model. A number of studies have been done over the past few years that try to solve this problem by considering a non-adversarial environment in which there exists only one player with no competitor. However, in real world scenarios, there is always more than one player competing with other players to influence the most nodes. This is called competitive influence maximization. Motivated by this, we try to solve the competitive influence maximization problem by proposing a new propagation model which is an extension of the Linear Threshold model and gives decision-making ability to nodes about incoming influence spread. We also propose an efficient algorithm for finding the influential nodes in a given social graph under the proposed propagation model which exploits the community structure of this graph to compute the spread of each node locally within its own community. The aim of our algorithm is to find the minimum number of seed nodes which can achieve higher spread in comparison with the spread achieved by nodes selected by other competitor. Our experiments on real world and synthetic datasets show that our approach can find influential nodes in an acceptable running time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Community detection; Competitive influence maximization; Influence maximization; Linear threshold model; Social network,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence

Knowledge-collector agents: Applying intelligent agents in marketing decisions with knowledge management approach,Moradi M.; Aghaie A.; Hosseini M.,2013,10.1016/j.knosys.2013.08.014,"Marketing plays an essential role in the competitive business environment. Marketing decision makers constantly need to monitor changes in the environment and organization to make necessary changes. Therefore, a knowledge management (KM) system is required to acquire, store, retrieve and use up-to-date knowledge. Corporations also tend to look for systems to assist them in knowledge management. Agent technology looks set for assisting organizations in collecting, processing and using knowledge with high accuracy, speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for marketing decision making through using agent technology, fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy AHP is used for allocating the weight of determinant criteria and fuzzy logic is deployed for determining the final decision in pessimistic, moderate and optimistic satiations. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) developing a knowledge management framework for capturing, storing, disseminating and utilizing marketing knowledge by using agent system, and (b) helping marketing decision makers to make effective decisions based on useful knowledge, and (c) encouraging marketing decisions towards the intelligence.

Identimod uses non-linear dynamic modeling and soft computing to identify the branding system from different data sources through a linguistic user interface, and to provide advanced methods for diagnostics and validation. Identimod steps through a participatory, cyclic, and iterative process consisting of four different modules to increase the confidence and validity of the model, which should facilitate its acceptance by managers and stakeholders.

A decision support framework to implement optimal personalized marketing interventions,Guelman L.; Guillén M.; Pérez-Marín A.M.,2015,10.1016/j.dss.2015.01.010,"In many important settings, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to a stimulus or ""treatment."" For instance, a treatment that works for the overall population might be highly ineffective, or even harmful, for a subgroup of subjects with specific characteristics. Similarly, a new treatment may not be better than an existing treatment in the overall population, but there is likely a subgroup of subjects who would benefit from it. The notion that ""one size may not fit all"" is becoming increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from economics to medicine. This has drawn significant attention to personalize the choice of treatment, so it is optimal for each individual. An optimal personalized treatment is the one that maximizes the probability of a desirable outcome. We call the task of learning the optimal personalized treatment personalized treatment learning. From the statistical learning perspective, this problem imposes important challenges, primarily because the optimal treatment is unknown on a given training set. A number of statistical methods have been proposed recently to tackle this problem. However, considering the critical importance of these methods to decision support systems, personalized treatment learning models have received relatively little attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method labeled causal conditional inference trees and its natural extension to causal conditional inference forests. The performance of the new method is analyzed and compared to alternative methods for personalized treatment learning. The results show that our new proposed method often outperforms the alternatives on the numerical settings described in this article. We also illustrate an application of the proposed method using data from a large Canadian insurer for the purpose of selecting the best targets for cross-selling an insurance product. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Causal inference; Marketing interventions; Personalized treatment learning,Elsevier,scopus-artificial intelligence
Identification of influencers - Measuring influence in customer networks,Kiss C.; Bichler M.,2008,10.1016/j.dss.2008.06.007,"Viral marketing refers to marketing techniques that use social networks to produce increases in brand awareness through self-replicating viral diffusion of messages, analogous to the spread of pathological and computer viruses. The idea has successfully been used by marketers to reach a large number of customers rapidly. If data about the customer network is available, centrality measures provide a structural measure that can be used in decision support systems to select influencers and spread viral marketing campaigns in a customer network. Usage stimulation and churn management are examples of DSS applications, where centrality of customers does play a role. The literature on network theory describes a large number of such centrality measures. A critical question is which of these measures is best to select an initial set of customers for a marketing campaign, in order to achieve a maximum dissemination of messages. In this paper, we present the results of computational experiments based on call data from a telecom company to compare different centrality measures for the diffusion of marketing messages. We found a significant lift when using central customers in message diffusion, but also found differences in the various centrality measures depending on the underlying network topology and diffusion process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules for personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique for personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.",Decision-tree induction; Internet advertising; Internet store-front; Machine learning; Personalization,M.E.

Scheduling pre-printed newspaper advertising inserts using genetic algorithms,Carter A.E.; Ragsdale C.T.,2002,10.1016/S0305-0483(02)00059-2,"In recent years, the use of pre-printed advertising inserts in newspapers has increased dramatically. Pre-printed inserts allow advertisers to deliver colorful, high-quality marketing material to targeted groups of consumers within the newspaper's delivery zone structure. To accommodate the increased workload associated with pre-printed inserts without negatively impacting the news deadline or delivery schedules, many newspaper companies face increasingly complex post-press scheduling decisions. This paper presents a spreadsheet model developed to represent the pre-printed insert scheduling problem in a case study of an actual medium-size newspaper company. The performance of two commercial genetic algorithm (GA) optimizers is compared on this problem. Computational testing shows the GAs develop schedules that substantially reduce the post-press production department's insert processing time. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A comparative study of hybrid machine learning techniques for customer lifetime value prediction,Tsai C.-F.; hu Y.-H.; Hung C.-S.; Hsu Y.-F.,2013,10.1108/03684921311323626,"Customer lifetime value (CLV) has received increasing attention in database marketing. Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Customer information; Customer lifetime value; Data mining; Database marketing; Hybrid models; Machine learning,,scopus-artificial intelligence
Marketing Intelligent Systems for consumer behaviour modelling by a descriptive induction approach based on Genetic Fuzzy Systems,Martínez-López F.J.; Casillas J.,2009,10.1016/j.indmarman.2008.02.003,"In its introduction this paper discusses why marketing professionals do not make satisfactory use of the marketing models posed by academics in their studies. The main body of this research is characterised by the proposal of a brand new and complete methodology for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), to be applied in marketing causal modelling and with utilities to be used as a marketing management decision support tool. Such methodology is based on Genetic Fuzzy Systems, a specific hybridization of artificial intelligence methods, highly suited to the research problem we face. The use of KDD methodologies based on intelligent systems like this can be considered as an avant-garde evolution, exponent nowadays of the so-called knowledge-based Marketing Management Support Systems; we name them as Marketing Intelligent Systems. The most important questions to the KDD process-i.e. pre-processing; machine learning and post-processing-are discussed in depth and solved.

Business intelligence for new market development: a web semantic network analysis approach,Lam Li F.; Fai Cheung C.; Bun Lee W.; Kwok S.K.,2007,10.1504/ijenm.2007.012758,"Marketing via internet becomes more popular and common since the development of internet service is mature. Nowadays, most companies have their own websites to promote their company products and services aiming at developing their business. To recognise macromarketing trends and real-time customers’ needs, contents in customer websites are valuable asset. However, different semantic patterns used in various parties may have great challenges in the comprehension of the content in the website. Moreover, organisational sales transaction system such as Management Information System (MIS) can help to determine sales performance of well-known customers. However, the customer information can only be part of the marketing information. As a result, this paper presents a Web Semantic Network Analysis (WSNA) approach for business intelligence. A prototype of an agent-based web Business Intelligence System (BIS) is established based on the WSNA approach. By adopting and integrating semantic network, agent technology, rule-based decision support system and scoring technique, the marking and sale performance information can be captured, clustered, compared, analysed, integrated and disseminated.

A sampling based sentiment mining approach for e-commerce applications,Vinodhini G.; Chandrasekaran R.M.,2017,10.1016/j.ipm.2016.08.003,"Emerging technologies in online commerce, mobile and customer experience have transformed the retail industry so as to enable the marketers to boost sales and the customers with the most efficient online shopping. Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method with several other classifiers used in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the ROC curve and geometric mean. © 2016",Ensemble; Imbalance; Opinion; Sampling; Sentiment,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-artificial intelligence

The BIG CHASE: A decision support system for client acquisition applied to financial networks,Quijano-Sanchez L.; Liberatore F.,2017,10.1016/j.dss.2017.04.007,"Bank agencies daily store a huge volume of data regarding clients and their operations. This information, in turn, can be used for marketing purposes to acquire new clients or sell products to existing clients. A Decision Support System (DSS) can help a manager to decide the sequence of clients to contact to reach a designed target. In this paper we present the BIG CHASE, a DSS that translates bank data into a reliability graph. This graph models relationships based on a probability of traversal function that includes social measures. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with Banco Santander, S.A., fits the parameters of the probability function to explicit solution evaluations given by experts by means of a specifically designed Projected Gradient Descent algorithm. The fitted probability function determines the reliabilities associated to the edges of the graph. An optimization procedure tailored to be efficient on very large sparse graphs with millions of nodes and edges identifies the most reliable sequence of clients that a manager should contact to reach a specific target. The BIG CHASE has been tested with a case study on real data that includes Banco Santander, S.A. 2015 Spain bank records. Experimental results show that the proposed DSS is capable of modeling the experts' evaluations into probability function with a small error. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Client acquisition; Financial networks; Maximum reliability path; Projected gradient descent; Social modelling,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence
Decision-centric active learning of binary-outcome models,Saar-Tsechansky M.; Provost F.,2007,10.1287/isre.1070.0111,"It can be expensive to acquire the data required for businesses to employ data-driven predictive modeling - for example, to model consumer preferences to optimize targeting. Prior research has introduced ""active-learning"" policies for identifying data that are particularly useful for model induction, with the goal of decreasing the statistical error for a given acquisition cost (error-centric approaches). However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly. We also show that this method is robust in the face of decreasing quality of utility estimations, eventually converging to uniform random sampling, and that it can be extended to situations where different data acquisitions have different costs. The results suggest that businesses should consider modifying their strategies for acquiring information through normal business transactions. For example, a firm such as Amazon.com that models consumer preferences for customized marketing may accelerate learning by proactively offering recommendations - not merely to induce immediate sales, but for improving recommendations in the future. © 2007 INFORMS.",Active learning; Classifier induction; Decision making; Decision-support systems; Predictive modeling,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-artificial intelligence

A model for bundling mobile value added services using neural networks,Kar A.K.; Singh P.,2012,10.1504/IJADS.2012.044946,"Mobile value added services has emerged as one of the significant revenue generators for the mobile telecommunication industry. With the large array of service offerings, telecom providers engage in active advertising of service bundles to attract new as well as retain the existing customers. Focused advertising by personalising the service bundles based on individual customer preferences is a key success factor of such campaigns. This paper proposes the application of a neural network-based decision support model for pattern association using which mixed bundles of such services may be identified, as per customer preferences, so as to induce higher conversion in cross-sales and up-sales. Consumer service preferences can be combined with some standard packages of VAS bundles to personalise the service bundles and these service bundles would be generated dynamically. Identifying and promoting such services identified through pattern association rules will have a direct impact on the overall profitability of the service provider.

Monitoring new product introductions with sell-through data from channel partners,Salmi L.; Holmström J.,2004,10.1108/13598540410544890,"Manufacturers of consumer goods need to see the market situation and end customer demand in order to efficiently allocate production capacity and procure materials. However, the difficulty to obtain timely and accurate demand data from the point-of-sales (POS) calls for alternative solutions to be developed. This paper presents a solution that is based on readily available sell-through data from channel partners, such as distributors, to monitor what happens on the market in product introduction situations. The difficulty with using demand information from distributors rather than the POS is the bullwhip effect that distorts demand as you move upstream in the supply chain. The paper presents how this problem can be overcome by using market mix views of product categories and simple smoothing techniques. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Control applications; Demand; Product launch,,scopus-artificial intelligence
"Predicting consumer behavior in the perspective of consumer neuroscience: Status, challenge, and future",Lei W.; Yikai Y.; Jiehui Z.; Xiaoyi W.,2020,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2020.06.001,"Neuromanagement is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that intersects neuroscience and social science. It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

Analysis of Online Consumer Behavior - Design of CRISP-DM Process Model,Exenberger E.; Bucko J.,2020,10.7160/AOL.2020.120302,"The basis of the modern marketing of a business entity is to know the behavior of its customers. Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior. To reach the main goal we perform a data analysis of the online sales data by using machine learning methods as clustering, decision tree and association rules mining. After evaluating the proposed model, we discuss its use of the proposed model in the field of internet sales in the agricultural sector.; JEL Classification: C53, D11, D91, M21, M31 © 2020",association rules; Classification; consumer behavior; data analysis; online shopping,Faculty of Economics and Management,scopus-artificial intelligence
Autonomous Shopping Systems: Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Consumer Adoption,de Bellis E.; Venkataramani Johar G.,2020,10.1016/j.jretai.2019.12.004,"Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous, able to make decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Whereas the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human–machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human–computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey.

DSS and GIS in knowledge transformation process,Klimešová D.; Brožová H.,2009,,"Knowledge is an important resource for successful decision-making process in the whole society today. The special procedures of control and management of knowledge therefore have to be used. In the area of knowledge management and knowledge engineering basic terms of these disciplines are data, information, knowledge and knowledge transformation. The knowledge can be defined as a dynamic human process of justifying personal beliefs. Knowledge is a product of successful decision-making process. Knowledge transformation is a spiralling process of interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge that leads to the new knowledge. Nonaka and al (2000) show, that the combination of these two categories makes possible to conceptualise four conversion steps: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation (SECI model). Another model of knowledge creation is the Knowledge Transformation Continuum (BCI Knowledge Group) that begins with the articulation of a specific instruction representing the best way that a specific task, or series of tasks, should be performed. Knowledge modelling and knowledge representation is an important field of research also in Computer Science andArtificial Intelligence. The definition of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is a noticeable different, because Artificial Intelligence is typically dealing with formalized knowledge (e.g. ontology). The development of knowledge-based systems was seen as a process of transferring human knowledge to an implemented knowledge base. Decision Support Systems (DSS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) modelling process support decision-making process, therefore they also produce a new knowledge. A Decision Support Systems are an interactive computer-based systems helping decision makers complete decision process. Geographic Information Systems provide essential marketing and customer intelligence solutions that lead to better business decisions. Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) is methodology based on system theory and theory of modelling. The OR/MS models serve for better quantification and precision of decision-making process. In this contribution the role of DSS, GIS and OR/MS models in the process of knowledge creation will be explained. The tacit or explicit character of this knowledge and the process of its creation will be explained and discussed. © 2009, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

A fuzzy GSS framework for organizational knowledge acquisition,Lee J.-N.; Kwok R.C.-W.,2000,10.1016/S0268-4012(00)00030-X,"Although the concept of viewing knowledge as a critical resource has been widely accepted in prior studies, it is not fully understood how to acquire available knowledge in order to improve organizational effectiveness. However, it is sure that organizational knowledge management should pursue the achievement of the business goal by delivering relevant and useful information to the right person at the right time. Group Support Systems (GSS) can play an important role in transfering scattered information into meaningful business knowledge for supporting strategic corporate decision-making. This study proposes a fuzzy GSS framework for acquiring workgroup knowledge from individual memory and aggregating workgroup knowledge into organizational knowledge. This study also proposes an architecture to support the fuzzy GSS framework. The architecture consists of user agents, information management agents, and a fuzzy model manager. To illustrate how the fuzzy GSS framework can be used to support the whole process of organizational knowledge acquisition, an Internet-based GSS was developed and applied in a marketing decision process.

Manipulate to empower: Hyper-relevance and the contradictions of marketing in the age of surveillance capitalism,Darmody A.; Zwick D.,2020,10.1177/2053951720904112,"In this article, we explore how digital marketers think about marketing in the age of Big Data surveillance, automatic computational analyses, and algorithmic shaping of choice contexts. Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence. The vision of digital marketing is therefore a fascinating one: marketing disappears at precisely the moment when it extends throughout the life without limit. © The Author(s) 2020.",algorithmic marketing; artificial intelligence; Big Data; consumer empowerment; digital marketing; hypernudging; manipulation; marketing automation; post-marketing; relevance; surveillance capitalism,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-artificial intelligence

A Decision Support System for market-driven product positioning and design,Lei N.; Moon S.K.,2015,10.1016/j.dss.2014.11.010,"This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) for market-driven product positioning and design, based on market data and design parameters. The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An Adaptive Intelligent Management System of Advertising for Social Networks: A Case Study of Facebook,Aguilar J.; Garcia G.,2018,10.1109/TCSS.2017.2759188,"At present, social networks are strongly used for personal or professional purposes. The social networks have accumulated a large amount of information, which can be used in different ways. One of such possible purposes is advertising. In particular, when a company pays for advertising in a social network, it wants to get an ideal deployment of the ads on the network. The ideal behavior aims at reducing the high costs to pay, the number of hours to design advertising, the difficulty in the creation of ads by lots, among other things. In particular, the optimization of the production of advertising on social networks, based on the performance of the ads, is not an easy task. If we make an incorrect design, this can result in losses for a company. In this sense, this paper presents an intelligent system of management of social network advertising, based on data mining techniques, to automatically produce ads. In addition, we test our adaptive mechanism of automated production (generation) of online advertising on Facebook. Our system carries out automatic modifications and improvements of ads.

Artificial intelligence-based predictions of movie audiences on opening Saturday,An Y.; An J.; Cho S.,2021,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.05.005,"Marketing activity by distributors is a significant factor in attracting audiences to theaters before a movie is released. Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy.

Hence, effective integration of environmental issues by means of tools improving information sharing and communication, may play a crucial role for the enhanced enterprise operation from an environmental perspective. In this sense, knowledge management technologies have proved to be highly promising for supporting this integration task. In this work, an ontological framework is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models sharing for the environmental assessment of the enterprise. The ontological model is applied to a case study considering a supply chain network design-planning and a process scheduling problem. The ontology provides an enterprise decision-making supporting tool by combining different information systems, which adapts and recognizes the different elements associated with the enterprise functions, and facilitates assessing the environmental performance of enterprises. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Market share analysis and prognosis using qualitative reasoning,Alpar P.; Dilger W.,1995,10.1016/0167-9236(94)00032-N,"Today, extensive quantitative modelling of the performance of marketing activities is possible due to the availability of rich data sets on product sales and related marketing actions. However, there are a number of product categories for which only inaccurate sales figures or data about marketing efforts exist (e.g., because a significant part of the sales is realized in stores without scanners or which do not make the data available to firm outsiders). In such cases, reliable quantitative findings about the impact of marketing-mix variables on sales may not be achievable but qualitative reasoning may, at least, indicate likely implications of past or planned marketing activities in terms of directions of change. Even in markets with good data qualitative reasoning may be a worthwhile first modelling approach when market conditions change so significantly that a previously used model is deemed unsatisfactory and not enough data exist yet for a specification of a revised quantitative model. We show specifically how qualitative reasoning can be used to diagnose and predict market share changes. The diagnostic part represents a combination of qualitative reasoning and extensions of a previously published rule-based expert system for that task while the prognostic part is solely based on qualitative process theory and order of magnitude reasoning. © 1995.",Artificial intelligence; Market share analysis; Marketing; Qualitative reasoning,,scopus-artificial intelligence
Cost-sensitive learning via priority sampling to improve the return on marketing and CRM investment,Cui G.; Wong M.; Wan X.,2012,10.2753/MIS0742-1222290110,"Because of the unbalanced class and skewed profit distribution in customer purchase data, the unknown and variant costs of false negative errors are a common problem for predicting the high-value customers in marketing operations. Incorporating cost-sensitive learning into forecasting models can improve the return on investment under resource constraint. This study proposes a cost-sensitive learning algorithm via priority sampling that gives greater weight to the high-value customers. We apply the method to three data sets and compare its performance with that of competing solutions. The results suggest that priority sampling compares favorably with the alternative methods in augmenting profitability. The learning algorithm can be implemented in decision support systems to assist marketing operations and to strengthen the strategic competitiveness of organizations. © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Mapping strategic thought and action in developing disruptive software technology: Advanced case study research on how the firm crafts shared vision,Pattinson H.M.; Woodside A.G.,2007,,"This case study uses two story-telling methods for analysis – an advanced hermeneutic framework and an extended form of decision systems analysis (DSA) incorporating cognitive mapping – to explore the strategic thought in building a software house around a philosophy of “best practice” application development. The paper explores decision-making for turning an ambitious vision (automation of enterprise-based sales and marketing activities) into a focused application (pricing configuration software), and then into a large software house (Trilogy) offering enterprise e-commerce suites. Trilogy’s management team’s decision-making was heavily influenced by a strong perception that the organization needed to take risks to achieve “critical mass” in anticipation of a convergence of “back-office” and “front-office” applications into one market. The advanced case study also addresses Trilogy’s transition of its applications into Internet environments, plus the transformation of the organization from a product-orientation to a strictly industry-based business and application development perspective. Trilogy has not compromised its strict application development philosophies, but has incorporated its fast cycle time (FCT) methods into its industry-focused business divisions – and now actually offers the method as a set of services. © Hugh M.

"Describing the users: Understanding adoption of and interest in shared, electrified, and automated transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area",Spurlock C.A.; Sears J.; Wong-Parodi G.; Walker V.; Jin L.; Taylor M.; Duvall A.; Gopal A.; Todd A.,2019,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.014,"Emerging technologies and services stand poised to transform the transportation system, with large implications for energy use and mobility. The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women's preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Automated vehicles; Car-sharing; Electric vehicles; Ride-hailing; Technology adoption; Transportation decisions,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-automation
Automated media and commercial populism,Volcic Z.; Andrejevic M.,2023,10.1080/09502386.2022.2042581,"This article considers the link between the increasingly important role of automated information curation online and the rise of what we call ‘commercial populism’. We invoke the term to refer to the convergence of populism as a marketing tool–a way of selling, for example, nutritional supplements or survivalist merchandise–with political strategies that cater to the citizen as consumer (whose freedoms are framed in the individual register of personal taste unfettered from civic concerns or constraints). Perhaps unsurprisingly in this context, we draw on the example of Donald Trump's political rise, which while not unrelated to his particular idiosyncrasies, demonstrates how the automated curation of social media aligns itself with what the aggressive rise of commercial populism. The goal of such an analysis is to consider how the combination of hyper-commercialism with the formal attributes of social media contributes to inter-related political pathologies of polarization and conspiracy theory. The consumer-oriented model of personal taste catered to by algorithmic curation highlights the paradox of ‘social’ media: they promise to enhance the social by displacing or reframing it fundamental a-social. The offloading of social decisions and formation onto commercial, automated systems for curating news and information reinforces this version of individualism, contributing to the forms of misrecognition that enable it. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",automation; Donald Trump; filter bubble; political polarization; Populism; social media,Routledge,scopus-automation

CAD/CAM systems for Dobby and Jacquard weaving; [CAD/CAM sistemi za listno in zakarsko tkanje],Bojic M.B.,1999,,"Unpredictable market conditions have forced textile sector to change the way of thinking and to introduce new technologies in order to increase marketing effects by quick and right decisions, shorter production cycles and more intense communications. Production cycle can be shortened in the phase of product designing and selecting, sampling, production and distribution. But how can the manufacturer decide for a certain product quickly and correctly? Primarily by using CAD/CAM system during the whole process, from idea, pattern, eleboration of technical data, sampling, preparation of production to final production. Another very important factor that additionally increases the importance of CAD/CAM systems is the globalization of the entire production process. Data transmission via internet is quick and considerably facilitates communications between buyers and manufacturers and remote production units. Textile CAD/CAM systems are mainly modularly structured and cover dobby weaving, jacquard weaving and all other textile fields. Optionally available are the packages for 3D simulation and marketing, compact discs with patterns and collections catalogues and virtual fashion shows. Systems for dobby and jacquard weaving are highly improved and simulations in proper density and by considering all constructional parameters look quite realistic. The paper presents some CAD/CAM systems, their features and advantages. The future will be characterized by full automation of the process from the buyer's order to the final production of fabric, which means immediate response and higher flexibility.",CAD/CAM systems; Communication; Designing of dobby fabrics; Designing of jacquard fabrics; Fabric simulation; Internet integration; ITMA,,scopus-automation

The construct of state-level suspicion: A model and research agenda for automated and information technology (IT) contexts,Bobko P.; Barelka A.J.; Hirshfield L.M.,2014,10.1177/0018720813497052,"Objective: The objective was to review and integrate available research about the construct of state-level suspicion as it appears in social science literatures and apply the resulting findings to information technology (IT) contexts. Background: Although the human factors literature is replete with articles about trust (and distrust) in automation, there is little on the related, but distinct, construct of ""suspicion"" (in either automated or IT contexts). The construct of suspicion-its precise definition, theoretical correlates, and role in such applications-deserves further study. Method: Literatures that consider suspicion are reviewed and integrated. Literatures include communication, psychology, human factors, management, marketing, information technology, and brain/neurology. We first develop a generic model of state-level suspicion. Research propositions are then derived within IT contexts. Results: Fundamental components of suspicion include (a) uncertainty, (b) increased cognitive processing (e.g., generation of alternative explanations for perceived discrepancies), and (c) perceptions of (mal)intent. State suspicion is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of these three components. Our analysis also suggests that trust inhibits suspicion, whereas distrust can be a catalyst of state-level suspicion. Based on a three-stage model of state-level suspicion, associated research propositions and questions are developed. These propositions and questions are intended to help guide future work on the measurement of suspicion (self-report and neurological), as well as the role of the construct of suspicion in models of decision making and detection of deception. Conclusion: The study of suspicion, including its correlates, antecedents, and consequences, is important. We hope that the social sciences will benefit from our integrated definition and model of state suspicion. The research propositions regarding suspicion in IT contexts should motivate substantial research in human factors and related fields.

Investment Decisions on Automation of Manufacturing in the Wood Products Industry: A Case Study,Salim R.; Manduchi A.; Johansson A.,2020,10.22382/bpb-2020-001,"The wood products industry is facing increasing challenges from global competition, and automation of manufacturing can greatly help companies in the industry to handle such challenges. Investments in automation of manufacturing are more likely to succeed if they are the expression of informed and systematic decisions. This paper aims to increase the knowledge on the process leading to investment decisions on automation of manufacturing in the wood products industry, as well as on the aspects considered in such processes. A real-time case study was conducted at a large Swedish wood manufacturing company to gain in-depth understanding of decisions related to automation investments. The findings demonstrate that mainly representatives from manufacturing and marketing functions were involved throughout the investment project's length. This could be a contributing factor to the narrow view on automation of manufacturing when decisions are made, where focus is placed on financial and technological aspects. The findings further show a limited knowledge regarding automation of manufacturing, which resulted in a tendency to heavily rely on the technical supplier’s recommendations. This paper identifies the weak points related to decisions on automation of manufacturing in the wood products industry and provides insights on how to support the decision process. © 2020, Society of Wood Science and Technology.

Offshore outsourcing of customer relationship management: Conceptual model and propositions,Kalaignanam K.; Varadarajan R.,2012,10.1007/s11747-011-0291-0,"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers. Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems, and other issues. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.",Cross-border outsourcing; Customer relationship management; Global marketing; International marketing; Offshore outsourcing; Offshoring,,scopus-automation
Overcoming the negative role of nostalgia in consumer reactions to automated products,Kremer P.; Feurer S.; Kim J.-Y.; Hoeffler S.,2022,10.1111/jpim.12641,"Automated products that take over tasks that consumers used to carry out themselves are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but consumers continue to resist such innovations. Drawing on the status quo bias as a theoretical framework, this article investigates the role of nostalgia in consumer reactions to product automation in a series of six experiments with almost 1500 participants. The first four experiments converge on a consistent finding: a high (versus low) degree of automation reduces consumers' nostalgic feelings about past consumption episodes, which in turn decrease nostalgia-prone consumers' product evaluations. Against this backdrop, we conduct two additional experiments to determine how firms' communication tactics can overcome the negative role of nostalgia proneness in consumer reactions to automated products. We conclude that managers involved in the marketing of automated products should assess the level of nostalgia in their target groups, and align both their intended positioning for the automated product and the decision to automate critical tasks within the product design that may evoke nostalgic feelings in consumers. Furthermore, when consumers are nostalgia-prone, managers should craft their launch communication tactics such that the focus is diverted from the automated task itself. © 2022 The Authors.

Four of 7 primary hypotheses were supported, predicting more than 65% of the variance in the research model. Effort expectancy, uncertainty avoidance, collective performance expectancy, and internal/organizational social influence all showed antecedent significance to contextual utilization of CRM technology. The results of this study suggest that group-oriented individual decision making and the related concept of institutional collectivism are equally as important as individual-oriented decision making in the international utilization of organizational technology. Based on the strong significance shown in the results of this study, it would also be wise to consider cultural value–derived uncertainty avoidance in practical development of training and implementation of multinational CRM systems. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",culture; customer relationship management; international; marketing; normative; sales; sales force automation; social influence; technology acceptance; technology utilization,Routledge,scopus-automation

"Progress toward the ""factory of the future""",Rosenthal S.R.,1984,10.1016/0272-6963(84)90012-3,"Despite the considerable attention being placed on the potential payoff's from programmable manufacturing technologies, remarkably little systematic research has been conducted on organizational plans, decisions, and associated actions. The 1982-83 factory automation surveys project of the Boston University Manufacturing Roundtable reported on here was designed to develop a broad managerial view of computer-aided manufacturing processes in the US. Our purpose was to create a body of information, drawn from the recent experience of leading-edge practitioners, that would begin to describe the range of behaviors accompanying the adoption and implementation of automation technologies, such as advanced numerical control, CAD/CAM and robots, which may be combined to form the ""factory of the future"". In short, we wanted to identify the kinds of progress being made by these manufacturers and the barriers that they, and those who are contemplating such process innovations, will face in the future. In each of our three surveys we had a specific target population in mind. The ""user"" survey was aimed at discrete-part manufacturing organizations that were leaders in adopting factory automation technologies. This survey was designed to address ""best practice"" at the level of a single strategic business unit and deals with specific automation projects. Our ""supplier"" survey was aimed at the major producers of each of the various factory automation technologies. Here we sought the observations and opinions of senior marketing executives in those firms with the most success (and therefore experience) in supplying computer-based manufacturing technologies. Finally, our ""expert"" survey was designed to test some of our preliminary findings from the users and suppliers, including insights gathered from in-depth follow-up telephone interviews with respondents to those two surveys. We intentionally tried to identify a broad sample of individuals whose views would be based on extensive factory automation experience in different capacities. Respondents to our three surveys consisted of 57 users, 38 suppliers and 64 experts. Findings from the three surveys form certain patterns that transcend the isolated facts commonly presented in the literature. The dominant impressions that emerged from the data were:. Leading-edge users of computer-aided manufacturing processes believe in learning by doing. Most have proceeded in an incremental fashion to develop an internal base of experience with factory automation technologies. They tend to have supportive management and a sense of where they are heading. Their current measurement capabilities, however, restrict the basis for making adoption decisions as well as the subsequent evaluation of impacts from recent technological innovations. These users usually rely heavily on outside suppliers for critical technical assistance and consider reliability factors to be more important than price in selecting a vendor. They generally feel they cannot afford to postpone decisions until improved technologies become available. Current leadingedge users will strongly affect the future direction of these technologies. Suppliers claim that most manufacturers are not sophisticated customers. They would like potential users to be more aware of their needs for improved manufacturing processes and to be more interested in the long-term strategic benefits of computer-aided manufacturing technologies already on the market. A classic dilemma seems to have arisen: decisions to adopt expensive factory automation technologies are often made by managers who lack the background to assess technological options, while staff familiar with the new technologies are less able to appreciate associated strategic dimensions. A likely outcome is a decision that is either short-sighted or misguided. Suppliers with limited direct experience in new applications of their technologies and little indepth knowledge of the business situations of their customers cannot be expected to help users avoid such errors. The most difficult problems in achieving computer integrated manufacturing are managerial rather than technical. Manufacturers contemplating factory automation face different issues depending on whether they adopt a retrofit strategy using existing production systems or whether they attempt to make a fresh start as new facilities are brought on stream. In either case, they often have inadequate internal technical resources, strong barriers to communication across traditional functional lines, and a reward structure that does not encourage risk-taking in the interest of long-term strategic gains. Manufacturing organizations that do not deal directly with these kinds of managerial problems are not likely to succeed in factory automation, even if appropriate technological options exist. These functions suggest that manufacturing managers ought to reflect on their organization's current strengths and weaknesses as they formulate a strategy for factory automation. In particular, they should begin with a healthy concern for the adequacy of their current base of knowledge, mix of human resources and formal measurement systems. They should also refine their expectations for integrated factory automation applications, to be sure that general goals such as ""enhanced flexibility"" have explicit operational meanings. Finally, they should improve their organization's ability to identify types of indirect costs, as well as benefits, that are implicit in such goals. These prescriptions apply to manufacturers just beginning to adopt programmable manufacturing technologies, as well as to those who are well along this path. Further in-depth research is needed if the progress being made by leading-edge users is to serve as a basis for more widespread attempts to move toward the ""factory of the future"". © 1984.",,,scopus-automation

Machine Learning in Supply Chain Management: A Systematic Literature Review,Mohamed-Iliasse M.; Loubna B.; Abdelaziz B.,2022,10.22034/ijsom.2021.109189.2279,"The supply chain ecosystem is currently benefiting from a great dynamic resulting from the digitalization of organizations and trades. For all the stakeholders in the area, this is a real breakthrough, and machine learning is at the core of this revolution. It has profoundly revolutionized companies in many aspects including the evolution of communication methods, the automation of many processes, the growing importance of information systems, etc. With shrinking margins and more demanding customers, supply chain management in increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage. Its management and optimization requires a factual to Supply Chain decision making at strategique, tactical and operational levels. In this context and data rich environment, machine learning approaches and techniques find numerous useful applications for supply chain decision making. Today, companies have no choice but to apply Machine Learning solutions in almost every part of their processes. This fact seems even clearer in markets where competition is fierce. While Machine Learning does not redefine the enterprise, it is certainly a powerful asset for both marketing and process optimization purposes. It is so ingrained in the strategies of companies that now most of them rely heavily on it for all processes from creation, to product quality control, to public relations. In recent years, a series of practical applications of machine learning (ML) for supply chain decisions have been introduced. By interconnecting the ML methods applied for SC decision making, this paper identifies current SC applications and indicates potential research gaps. In this paper, we examine the general usability of machine learning techniques to assist with supply chain decisions. The main objective of this research is therefore to study how machine learning techniques can be integrated into the range of tools available to supply chain decision makers in order to take advantage of the increasing volume of data generated in the supply chain. © 2022 Authors.

How organisations generate and use customer insight,Said E.; Macdonald E.K.; Wilson H.N.; Marcos J.,2015,10.1080/0267257X.2015.1037785,"The generation and use of customer insight in marketing decisions is poorly understood, partly due to difficulties in obtaining research access and partly becausemarket-based learning theory views knowledge as a fixed asset. However, customer insight takes many forms, arrives at the organisation from increasingly diverse sources and requires more than mere dissemination if it is to be useful. A multiple case study approach is used to explore managerial practices for insight generation and use. Multiple informants from each of four organisations in diverse sectors were interviewed. Findings reveal the importance of value alignment and value monitoring across the insight demand chain, to complement the information processing emphasis of extant research. Within the firm, the study suggests the importance of customer insight conduct practices including insight format, the role of automation and insight shepherding, to complement the much-researched process perspective. The study provides a basis for assessing the effectiveness of insight processes by both practitioners and scholars. © 2015, Westburn Publishers Ltd.",Business to business marketing; Case study; Customer insight; Market research; Market-based learning,Routledge,scopus-automation
Recruitment Promotion via Twitter: A Network-centric Approach of Analyzing Community Engagement Using Social Identity,Xian Ng L.H.; Cruickshank I.J.,2023,10.1145/3617127,"With the proliferation of online technologies, social media recruitment has become an essential part of any company’s outreach campaign. A social media platform can provide marketing posts with access to a large pool of candidates and at a low cost. It also provides the opportunity to quickly customize and refine messages in response to the reception. With online marketing, the key question is: which communities are attracted by recruitment tweets on social media? In this work, we profile the Twitter accounts that interact with a set of recruitment tweets by the U.S. Army’s Recruitment Command through a network-centric perspective. By harnessing how users signal their affiliations through user information, we extract and analyze communities of social identities. From Social Identity Theory, these social identities can be critical drivers of behavior, like the decision to enlist in the military. With this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of the U.S. Army’s recruitment campaign on Twitter, observing that these campaigns typically attract communities with military exposure like veterans or those that identify with professional careers and fitness (e.g., student, professionals, athletes). The campaign also attracts, but at a much lower level, interaction from those in the digital industries—data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, and so forth. When analyzing the accounts in terms of their degree of automation, we find a set of intent-unknown bot accounts interacting with the tweets, and that many of the recruitment accounts are perceived as automated accounts. These observations can aid in campaign refinement: targeting the digital community and getting a broader reach for online recruitment publicity campaigns. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

Customised risk assessment in manufacturing: A step towards the future of occupational safety management,Comberti L.; Demichela M.,2022,10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105809,"Following the enforcement of the EEC Directive (1989), focused on the promotion of workers health and safety, several approaches have been developed in the last 30 years to assess the risks related to the different hazards in the work environment and to identify, based on this assessment process, measures and action to promote safety and to reduce the occupational accidents. These approaches generally are focused on the analysis of the working activity and neglect the influence of the worker characteristics involved, strongly limiting the effectiveness of the risk-based decision making. This has a particular relevance in manufacturing field, where workers are still widely employed in several tasks, despite an increasing processes automation. Within this paper an innovative approach to explicitly consider the individual characteristic of the workers within the risk assessment in the work environment is described. Integration of a Human Performance model within risk assessment process is thus proposed. The resulting method allowed the definition of a customized risk based both on the individual skill of the worker involved and on the characteristics of the work places The comparison between risk assessed with traditional method and the customized risk showed the relevant influence that the human performance may have on the risk level to which the workers are exposed to and consequently allowed the company to identify the need for technical and organisational prevention and protection measures not highlighted with the more traditional approach. This method was applied for validation to an assembly line of a heavy vehicles manufacturing plant. The impact on the risk assessment is here shown and discussed, while the results in terms of safety at the workplace are still in the phase of data collection and will be published in future work. This model represents a step into the future of safety as a precursor of a more general process of customization at the individual level that is ongoing in several branches from the precision and personalized medicine (Duarte and Spencer, 2016) to the individual financial and marketing methods (Matz and Netzer, 2017). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Customized Risk; Human performance; Occupational safety management,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-automation

Optimizing service productivity,Rust R.T.; Huang M.-H.,2012,10.1509/jm.10.0441,"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor-automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Customer satisfaction; Financial impact; Marketing metrics; Self-service; Service productivity; Service quality; Technology,,scopus-automation
Automating the audience commodity: The unacknowledged ancestry of programmatic advertising,McGuigan L.,2019,10.1177/1461444819846449,"Programmatic advertising describes techniques for automating and optimizing transactions in the audience marketplace.

Service personalization for assistive living in a mobile ambient healthcare-networked environment,Vergados D.D.,2010,10.1007/s00779-009-0278-8,"For more than a decade, it has been observed that due to the continuously increasing elderly population, medical expenditures for home health-care have rapidly increased every year. Health-care organizations are being encouraged to find more efficient methods of providing high-quality care with cost savings. Elderly people who live alone may fear being unable to obtain help if they are injured or ill. For many families, the fear of such an event can dominate decisions about living arrangements. During the last decades, this fear has generated an industry, marketing house automations, alarm-and-notification systems as well as assistive technologies and interventions that aim at easier and more efficient control of their living environment, as well as the provision of specialized home-care services.

They argue that a growing proportion of marketing decisions can not only be supported but may also be automated. From a standpoint of both efficiency (e.g., management productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., resource allocation decisions), such automation is highly desirable. The authors describe how model-based automated decision-making is likely to penetrate various marketing decision-making environments and how such models can incorporate competitive dynamics.

Owing to the strong client base spread all over the world and the massive sales force, the organization needed to focus on a more efficient sales tracking system. Ravi Kathuria, Senior Vice president - Global Marketing & Alliances of Birlasoft was keen to align the organization's dispersed sales force through Sales Force Automation (SFA) system. In this context, SFA was expected to provide transparency and clear visibility of the sales pipeline. There was also an expectation that SFA would help in improving efficiency of global sales force in terms of reporting and customer analysis. At first, the organization decided to implement a home grown sales force automation system, which turned out be a failure, owing to both internal and external factors. This led Kathuria to explore other options which could meet their system requirements and could be implemented in shorter time frames with minimum budget. They evaluated multiple options and are debating on which system to opt for. This case examines the various software delivery methods in the decision on new software procurement. Several software and vendor parameters and the analytical structure and process for evaluating software vendors are included for consideration.

Industry 4.0 technologies and managers' decision-making across value chain. Evidence from the manufacturing industry,Młody M.; Ratajczak-Mrozek M.; Sajdak M.,2023,10.2478/emj-2023-0021,"The paper aims to identify how Industry 4.0 technologies affect the quality and speed of the managers' decision-making process across the different stages of the value chain, based on the example of the manufacturing sector. The paper adopts qualitative research, based on nine in-depth interviews with key informants, to capture senior executives' experiences with implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in their organisations. The research is focused on three manufacturing industries: the automotive, food and furniture industries. The research shows that depending on the stage of the value chain, different Industry 4.0 technologies are more suitable for the support of managers' decisions. Various Industry 4.0 technologies support decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain. In the Design stage, 3D printing and scanning technologies play a crucial role. In the case of Inbound Logistics, robotisation, automation, Big Data analysis, and Business Intelligence are most useful. During the Manufacturing stage, robotisation, automation, 3D printing, scanning, Business Intelligence, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine (M2M) integration enable quick decision-making and speed up production. Sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) optimise distribution in the Outbound Logistics stage. And finally, Business Intelligence supports decisions within the Sales and Marketing stage. It is also the most versatile technology among all particular stages. The paper provides empirical evidence on the Industry 4.0 technology support in decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain, which leads to more effective value chain management, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions at each value-chain stage. When using properly selected Industry 4.0 technologies, managers can optimise their production processes, reduce costs, avoid errors and improve customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, Industry 4.0 technologies facilitate predictive analytics to forecast and anticipate future demand, quality issues, and potential risks. This knowledge allows organisations to make better decisions and take proactive actions to prevent problems.  © 2023 Michał Młody et al., published by Sciendo.",decision-making; Industry 4.0; manufacturing industry; technologies; value chain,Sciendo,scopus-automation

At home with sustainability: From green default rules to sustainable consumption,Hale L.A.,2018,10.3390/su10010249,"Although it is often assumed that default rules affect change without awareness, this paper suggests that contrast with the default and transition into conscious adoption of the default design may be the starting point to establish long-term changes in consumer behavior. Despite the rooting of default rules in subconscious decision-making, this research finds that, ultimately, awareness drives the demand necessary for the creation of sustainable consumption. Whereas direct appeal to individuals has a disappointing level of influence on sustainability choices, it is understood that green consumers do come from somewhere. Green default rules offer interesting prospects for sidestepping the drawbacks of direct marketing to individuals. Under green default rules, behavior is guided by a default, such as utilities automatically sending customers renewables-sourced instead of fossil-fuel-based energy. To act otherwise requires additional effort and is less likely. Motivated by a need to understand how defaults might bridge standards and sustainable consumption, I investigate how organizational processes potentially lead from standardized green default rules to individual awareness that can spread and facilitate sustainable consumption. This paper examines the Active House sustainable building demonstrations in Europe in order to understand how (1) communications and market creation and (2) responsible, user-centered experimentation are organized to move from defaults to sustainable consumption. © 2018 by the authors.",Automation; Default bias; Green default rules; Smart home; Standardization; Sustainable building; Sustainable consumption,MDPI,scopus-automation
Research needs in managing factory automation,Meredith J.; Hyer N.L.; Gerwin D.; Rosenthal S.R.; Wemmerlöv U.,1986,10.1016/0272-6963(86)90025-2,"The subject of factory automation is a critical one for all business functions, with the potential of creating an entire upheaval in the fields of accounting, finance, marketing, general management, and most significantly, operations management. Totally new ways of managing a business are likely, but it is not yet clear what these ways may be. In spite of the tremendous implications of these new technologies, little research is being conducted in this area. A panel session exploring this topic was thus offered at the 1984 Toronto meeting of the American Institute for Decision Sciences. This article presents the results of that session. The intent of the article is to foster research interest in this area and identify the extensive opportunities available. The article reviews the extant literature concerning the management of factory automation and identifies the gaps in our knowledge where research is needed. Factory automation as defined here is intended to include the areas of both hard automation (CAD/CAM, robotics, FMS, etc.) and soft automation (such as MRP II, group technology, MAP, data networking). Research issues are divided into three major topic areas for ease of discussion: strategic issues, justification issues, and implementation issues. The strategic area encompasses the subjects of corporate strategy and its tie with manufacturing strategy, firm characteristics of leading-edge users of automation, the effect of learning and experience with automation, the concept of ""synergy"" among automation technologies, technology transfer, and implementation strategy. The justification issues are divided into benefit, cost, and risk aspects. The present inadequacy of economic justification techniques for automation systems and the pros and cons of alternative approaches are explored. The consideration of differing types of automation and their possible need for differing justification techniques is also discussed. For both benefits and costs, the quantification problem is a major issue, particularly with benefits believed to improve the effectiveness of operations, rather than their efficiency (a major advantage of the automation technologies, it is often claimed). Another major issue here is the pre- and postautomation comparison, requiring accurate and thorough manufacturing audit techniques. The risks in automation can be tremendous. Whether this can be reduced through incremental automation, or other approaches, is a very important question. The nature of the risks-technological, financial, sociological-is also an important subject for research, as well as methods to deal with each type. Topics in the implementation area include procedural aspects, human aspects, interface/infrastructure aspects, and measurement and reward aspects. In general, the nature of the automation implementation process, and its solution, is a critical research area that is confounded with multiple factors. There is a need for research to determine if such a thing as a ""best"" implementation path exists for specific technologies and firms. How does a firm know if it is ""ready"" for automation, and which automation technology to start with? The effect of automation on workers and management is an important research question. And in addition, what are the effects of these employees on the implementation process? And it will be necessary to know how jobs change under automation, for both line and staff. Research is also needed to determine how automation will affect the way the firm does business, how interdepartmental coordination will be affected, and whether there will even be departments. If automation is implemented piecemeal, can the pieces later be tied together? What will be the problems? Managers need to know if new measurement and reward systems will be needed for workers, or perhaps even more important, for the managers. Will incentives need to be increased, or changed in some other fashion, for managers to be willing to take the risks involved in automation? Last, some advice is given to the potential researcher in this area. Approaching this subject in a way that yields meaningful research, helpful to real managers currently struggling with these problems, is important since real firms are our primary research laboratories in this field. For example, case studies, interviews, surveys, and conceptual development are important early tools in this area compared to the traditional model building and analysis techniques that have historically characterized operations management. © 1986.",,,scopus-automation
Growth hacking and international dynamic marketing capabilities: a conceptual framework and research propositions,Bargoni A.; Jabeen F.; Santoro G.; Ferraris A.,2024,10.1108/IMR-07-2022-0156,"Purpose: Few studies have conceptualized how companies can build and nurture international dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMCs) by implementing growth hacking strategies. This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice. Hence, this study could stimulate researchers to deepen the phenomenon and empirically validate the propositions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data; Cognitive computing; Data-driven decision-making; Growth hacking; International dynamic marketing capabilities; International marketing,Emerald Publishing,scopus-automation
Social Media Discussions on the FDA’s Modified Risk Tobacco Product Authorization of IQOS,Jun J.; Zhang N.; Zain A.; Mohammadi E.,2022,10.1080/10826084.2021.2019777,"Background: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the marketing of the IQOS tobacco heating system as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) in July 2020, permitting its ‘reduced exposure’ marketing. This decision is accompanied by much controversy among the global health community. We provide a preliminary analysis of Twitter conversations regarding the MRTP authorization of IQOS by identifying the authors, valence towards the policy decision, source of cited link, and focused topic. Methods: We analyzed 548 tweets mentioning MRTP posted between July 2016 (when PMI submitted the proposal) and October 2020. Results: We found a higher proportion of pro-MRTP valence (25.4%) than anti-MRTP (16.2%). Nearly half of the tweets (47.2%) expressing personal opinions presented pro-MRTP valence (vs. anti-MRTP = 23.9%). The FDA website was more frequently cited in pro-MRTP tweets (30.8% vs. anti = 4.8%), while tobacco control advocates’ websites were cited only in anti-MRTP tweets (77.4% vs. pro = 0). Pro-MRTP valence appeared more frequently in tweets mentioning health (53.1% vs. anti =38.5%) and cessation (100% vs. anti = 0). Nearly 42% of tweets showed a bot score greater than.43, indicating a possibility of automation.

They planned to call their board of advisors to discuss the future of SmartFleet, the new product of the Philippines-based firm called Pahrsek Inc. SmartFleet is a cloud-based fleet management tool that provides enterprise resource planning capability to fleet vehicle operators. For Maui and Mannix, there were numerous challenges ranging from developing a pricing strategy, growing the market as a pioneer in this industry in the Philippines, to proactively managing the potential global competitors who were on the verge of the Philippines market. They were anxious because they knew that only a set of careful, well-thought out and smart decisions could ensure survival and sustainability of this new venture. © 2017, Association for Information Technology Trust.",Automation; Cloud-based tools; Enterprise resource planning; Marketing; Pricing; Strategy,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,scopus-automation
Broadening the perspective on marketing decision models,Van Bruggen G.H.; Wierenga B.,2000,10.1016/s0167-8116(00)00017-3,"Marketing models are of invaluable importance for the advancement of marketing science. Regarding the role of models in marketing decision-making in practice we question the claim that marketing models are routinely used by many companies. Marketing models are suitable for certain types of marketing decision situations but much less for others. We advocate the development of integrated marketing management support systems (MMSSs), in which the strong points of marketing models are combined with the strengths of other types of MMSSs. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",Decision automation; Marketing decision models; Marketing management support systems; Success metrics,Elsevier,scopus-automation
Scope of heuristics and digitalization: the case of marketing automation,Guercini S.,2022,10.1007/s11299-022-00291-x,"This paper focuses on the impact of digitalization and marketing automation on the “scope” of the heuristics adopted in the marketers’ decision-making processes. The “scope” refers to the decision-making contexts in which the use of the heuristic rules is diffuse and is effective. More precisely, “scope"" is (the extension of) the field in which a heuristic can be applied (successfully). The article is based on evidence collected through ethnographic interviews with twenty-three experienced marketers to discuss the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristic rules in decision-making. The marketers interviewed make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks as emerged from previous exploratory research. The paper discusses how the field of application of marketing experts' heuristics evolves as result of the digitalization and in particular of the use of automatic marketing systems. The adoption of the new automatic marketing tools modifies the task environment and the field of use of the traditional heuristic rules, but heuristics remain fundamental in the definition phase of the inputs for the automatic marketing systems, or for the interpretation of the output and therefore for the control of the marketing automation. The paper clarifies the concept of scope of heuristics and offers a rich description of the impact of marketing automation on scope. © 2022, The Author(s).",Adaptive toolbox; Digitalization; Ethnographic interviews; Marketers’ heuristics; Marketing automation; Scope of heuristics,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-automation
The Relationship between Time and Success in Administrative Automation Projects — A Study in Decision-Making,Vollering J.B.; Waarts E.,1986,10.1177/017084068600700405,"This article is concerned with the relationship between time and success in the context of the procurement and implementation of administrative automation projects. It gives insight into the optimal thoroughness for user organizations to prepare themselves for the purchase of a new system. Interest in the subject stems from a contradiction found in the literature: on the one hand thorough (internal) planning and preparation of projects are recommended while on the other hand other authors state a plea for early (external) co-operation and negotiation with suppliers. Is a very thorough internal preparation a good pay-off or is it better to interact with potential suppliers after a restricted internal preparation? Results from this empirical research — which is part of a major study on marketing and purchasing of mainframe computer-systems — show that an optimum in thoroughness of internal preparation exists which is most effective regarding the quality of the project. A few important implications for user organizations are also mentioned. © 1986, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.",,,scopus-automation
Using revenue sharing to create win-win in the video rental supply chain,Van Der Veen J.A.A.; Venugopal V.,2005,10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601879,"Recent developments in video rental supply chains seem to indicate that revenue sharing contracts are beneficial to all parties involved in the industry. This paper illustrates a theoretical underpinning of the observed practice. A video rental supply chain is modelled to study pricing and replenishment decision making by the two autonomous firms in the chain, namely a movie studio producing the tapes and a video rental shop renting the tapes to customers. In the model the movie studio is to set the price for selling the tapes to the video rental store and the video rental shop must decide the number of copies of the new movie videotape it should purchase. The paper illustrates that revenue sharing contract can optimize the chain and bring win-win situations to the players in the industry. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Autonomy-Based Listening: Vietnamese University Students’ Perceptions of Self-Access Web-Based Listening Practices,Thi Mai V.L.,2023,10.37237/140303,"Self-access language learning (SALL) can promote autonomy among language learners. It is a practical means for creating comfortable, personalized environments in which learners can take a more active part in making decisions and choices in their language learning trajectories. In the domain of second language (L2) listening, self-access work can fulfill the individual needs of learners whose listening processes are supposed to be respected. However, in countries where English is taught as a foreign language (EFL), this is not always the case due to traditional teacher-led large-sized listening classrooms and test-oriented curricula. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate Vietnamese students’ perceptions of a self-access listening platform (SALP) which was built to facilitate L2 beginners to get familiar with the fast delivery of speech and to involve their personal interpretations of the input into the comprehension process. The study also aimed to examine whether this self-access approach can cultivate autonomous listening. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews with 15 non-English major university students whose disciplines were business management, marketing, communication, and public relations. They completed a six-week listening course on this online listening platform. The major findings indicate that students had positive listening experiences with the SALP regarding time flexibility and practicality. Despite students’ full awareness of the potential benefits of the SALP, a few of them still showed resistance to the self-access listening approach as a substitution for traditional classroom-based listening. The results reported here shed new light on the possibilities of implementing autonomy-based listening in a virtual self-access environment in L2 listening pedagogy. © 2023 Author(s).",learner autonomy; learners’ perceptions; self-access language learning; self-access listening; Vietnamese EFL learners,Kanda University of International Studies,scopus-autonomous
Intelligent agents for e-marketplace: Negotiation with issue trade-offs by fuzzy inference systems,Cheng C.-B.; Chan C.-C.H.; Lin K.-C.,2006,10.1016/j.dss.2005.02.009,"Automated negotiation by autonomous agents has become increasingly important since the advent of e-marketplace. In this study, automated negotiation is viewed as a search process in which negotiators jointly search for a mutually acceptable contract in a multidimensional space formed by negotiable issues. This search is formulated as a multiple-objective decision making problem and is solved through an iterative process of generating offers by fuzzy inference systems. These fuzzy inference systems serve as a search heuristic and are formulated based on the strategy of issue trade-offs. Five experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed automated negotiation algorithm. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion: a critical review,Zhang H.; Vorobeychik Y.,2019,10.1007/s10462-017-9577-z,"Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer science. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agent-based modeling; Calibration; Empirical method; Innovation diffusion; Literature review; Validation,Springer Netherlands,scopus-autonomous
“Futurizing” smart service: implications for service researchers and managers,Wuenderlich N.V.; Heinonen K.; Ostrom A.L.; Patricio L.; Sousa R.; Voss C.; Lemmink J.G.A.M.,2015,10.1108/JSM-01-2015-0040,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to craft a future research agenda to advance smart service research and practice. Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on discussions in the workshop on “Fresh perspectives on technology in service” at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings – We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value – Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored. We provide a fresh perspective on service research by characterizing relevant aspects of smart service that will stimulate fruitful future research and advance the understanding and practice of smart services. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Connected services; Intelligent object; New service type; Smart services,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-autonomous
Modelling cybersecurity regulations for automated vehicles,Khalid Khan S.; Shiwakoti N.; Stasinopoulos P.; Warren M.,2023,10.1016/j.aap.2023.107054,"Technological advancements in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), particularly the integration of diverse stakeholder groups (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, repairers, CAV consumers, and the general public) and the pursuit of new economic opportunities, have resulted in the emergence of new technical, legal, and social challenges. The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency. Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard. © 2023 The Authors",Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical system; Driverless cars; Governance; Laws,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-autonomous
Crop protection market segmentation: relationship between buyer segments and the use of digital sales channels,Schweringi D.S.; Hollenbeck A.; Krone S.; Spiller A.; Lemken D.,2022,10.22434/IFAMR2021.0095,"Digital technologies are revolutionizing agricultural trade, enabling farm input suppliers to reach customers through multiple channels. The aim of this study was to segment farmers based on their purchasing behavior for crop protection products and to examine segment-specific characteristics in the digital environment. A cluster analysis of 590 German farm managers was used to identify five distinctive buyer segments based on five characteristics: dealer, brand and service orientation, price affinity and autonomous decision making. The results demonstrate that farmers place high value on personal contacts to stationary suppliers when purchasing crop protection products. Service orientation turned out to be a strong mediator of segment membership, while price and product brand are secondary to farmer segmentation. However, traditional typologies are only suitable for the digitization topic to a limited extent, as digital search and information behavior hardly differs. Even though digital information procurement is becoming increasingly interesting for all segments, an openness to e-commerce applies only to a small group of independent buyers. Concerning e-commerce attitudes, the perception of its advantages and the lack of personal contact differentiates the clusters the most. The results contribute to the scientific understanding of farmers’ information and purchasing behavior and provide initial approaches for the development of customer-centric corporate marketing strategies. © 2022 Schulze Schwering et al.",Agri-chemical; Cluster analysis; Farm inputs; Omni-channel; Purchasing behavior,Wageningen Academic Publishers,scopus-autonomous
A multicriteria integral framework for agent-based model calibration using evolutionary multiobjective optimization and network-based visualization,Moya I.; Chica M.; Cordón Ó.,2019,10.1016/j.dss.2019.113111,"Automated calibration methods are a common approach to agent-based model calibration as they can estimate those parameters which cannot be set because of the lack of information. The modeler requires to validate the model by checking the parameter values before the model can be used and this task is very challenging when the model considers two or more conflicting outputs. We propose a multicriteria integral framework to assist the modeler in the calibration and validation of agent-based models that combines evolutionary multiobjective optimization with network-based visualization, which we believe is the first integral approach to model calibration. On the one hand, evolutionary multiobjective optimization provides several sets of calibration solutions (i.e., parameter values) with different trade-offs for the considered objectives in a single run. On the other hand, network-based visualization is used to better understand the decision space and the set of solutions from the obtained Pareto set approximation. To illustrate our proposal, we face the calibration of three agent-based model examples for marketing which consider two conflicting criteria: the awareness of the brand and its word-of-mouth volume. The final analysis of the calibrated solutions shows how our proposed framework eases the analysis of Pareto sets with high cardinality and helps with the identification of flexible solutions (i.e., those having close values in the design space). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based modeling; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Information visualization; Model calibration,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-autonomous
How and when brand coolness transforms product quality judgments into positive word of mouth and intentions to buy/use,Bagozzi R.P.; Khoshnevis M.,2023,10.1080/10696679.2022.2081925,"Brand coolness is a relatively understudied but important marketing phenomenon that only recently has received systematic scrutiny. We investigate a multidimensional structure of brand coolness and show how it mediates the effects of product quality on word of mouth communication and on intentions to buy/use cool brands. We also demonstrate under what conditions brand coolness influences WOM and intentions. The self-concept, rooted in materialism and expressed as the desire to impress other people and to compare oneself to others so as to emulate them, serves to regulate the effects of brand coolness in a negative way on WOM and intentions, thereby fulfilling the autonomous function of brand coolness for consumers described in the past as one important aspect of brand coolness. In order to show the incremental contribution of brand coolness in predicting WOM and decisions to buy/use cool brands, the effects of brand coolness are tested in head-to-head comparisons with the influence of self-brand connections and attitudes toward cool brands, which are classically studied brand drivers, on a representative sample of 400 adult Americans aged 20–40 years inclusive. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Routledge,scopus-autonomous
Categorization of organizational reputation and subordinate organizations' global funding outcome: A higher education perspective,Anand A.; Kumar V.; Lahiri A.,2024,10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.11.009,"Reputation is critical for building relationships with business customers in the global marketplace. However, in structurally connected organization configurations, the literature focuses mainly on one of the functional unit's reputations (either subordinate or superordinate organization), leaving out the interplay of reputation among various units in the organization. Drawing on identity and categorization theories, we develop a framework to examine the effects of brand reputation at both levels. Our study context is higher education, where business schools (subordinate) operate as autonomous entities globally yet are dependent on universities (superordinate) for policy decisions. We specify a random effects model on a 10-year panel dataset of 193 business schools to account for unobserved heterogeneity, potential selection bias, and endogeneity of reputation. Our findings suggest that brand reputation attributes at the subordinate and superordinate levels both individually and synergistically affect subordinate funding outcomes (i.e., business-school endowment). Furthermore, subordinate-level resource-utilization signals, such as diversification strategies and top executives' backgrounds, and superordinate-level policy signals, such as organization ownership and inclusivity, inform donor decisions and moderate the reputation–funding relationship. Our study suggests that administrators and managers should consider donor identity salience in marketing efforts. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Brand identity salience; Categorization theory; Higher education; Information signals; Organizational reputation,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-autonomous
Factors that influence parents’ intentions of using autonomous vehicles to transport children to and from school,Jing P.; Du L.; Chen Y.; Shi Y.; Zhan F.; Xie J.,2021,10.1016/j.aap.2021.105991,"High-level autonomous vehicles (AVs) are likely to improve the quality of children's travel to and from school (such as improve travel safety and increase travel mobility). These expected benefits will not be presented if parents are not willing to use AVs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore parents’ intentions of using AVs to transport children to and from school (parents’ intentions). This study has two primary aims: 1) Exploring parents’ intentions and their potential determinants. 2) Making recommendations for manufacturers to develop and market AVs suitable for school travel based on the research results. Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents’ intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents’ intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents’ intentions. The direct impact of perceived ease of use and public engagement on parents’ intentions is not significant. Finally, this research could provide decision-making support for governments and manufacturers to formulate relevant policies and marketing strategies, promoting parents’ acceptance of AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Autonomous vehicles; Parents’ intentions; School travel; Travel safety,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-autonomous

The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of consumer selection for purchasing channel and the corresponding influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,976 valid questionnaires were collected by convenience sampling from 34 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China in 2020 via the Internet, yielding a response rate of 82.2%. A categorical statistical approach was used to understand consumer's selection for each channel. Besides, binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors affecting consumers' channel selection. Findings: The results show that Chinese wine consumers' main purchasing channels are as follows: supermarket/mall, wine specialty stores, comprehensive e-business flagship stores, comprehensive e-business individual stores, restaurants and short video and live streaming platforms. Estimation results showed that among the 12 influencing factors in 4 categories, consumers' education and some other factors significantly influenced consumers' decision on wine purchasing channels. Research limitations/implications: Limited by time and experimental conditions, this study did not analyze the trend of wine consumers' purchasing channel selection. Future work would concentrate on multi-year data and conduct longitudinal comparative analysis. Originality/value: This study innovatively subdivides the currently popular wine sales channels in Chinese market and conducts research related to consumer channel selection.

Food information environments: Risk communication and advertising imagery,Ferreira C.,2006,10.1080/13669870601065536,"The imagery of any foodstuff is shaped by assumptions of what is culturally valued as food, assumptions that are also fed by marketing, expert nutritional advice and intermittent food ""alarms"". This paper raises the issue of risk communication versus advertising and argues that in order to better understand consumers' response to food risk communication we should pay closer attention to the broader information environment in which the compromised foodstuffs are embedded. Any new information properly crafted in the form of ""risk messages"" necessarily interacts with the information that constitutes the foodstuff's environment. It is proposed that focusing on such an environment, rather than on the ""content"" of the risk message alone, improves understanding of how the risk message eventually triggers further selections and decisions about the compromised foodstuff. The risk communication is itself a media event and is seen as part of the food information environment rather than autonomous to it.",Consumers; Food; Marketing; Risk communication; The media,,scopus-autonomous

How to balance the conflicts between ecosystem protection and ecosystem services consumption by local residents has been a serious challenge, especially in ecologically vulnerable areas. To explore the reasonable ecosystem services consumption approaches of grassland ecosystems for sustainable land system management, this study takes Hulun Buir of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a case study region and develops an EcoC-G (ecological consumption of grassland) model based on herders' livelihood behaviors using the agent-based model technique to simulate the dynamics of ecosystem pressure, livestock production, and living quality of herders under different grassland management scenarios over the next 30 years. The EcoC-G model links the supply and consumption of grassland ecosystem services by calculating the ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) supply and household NPP consumption. The model includes three sub-models, namely, the individual status transferring sub-model, the households' grassland-use decision sub-model, and the ecosystem pressure sub-model. In accordance with multi-objective grassland management practices, the following four land management scenarios were simulated: (1) baseline scenario, (2) increasing household's living standard, (3) ecosystem protection, and (4) balancing living standard improvement with the protection of the ecosystem. The result indicates that by focusing on the NPP supply and consumption of the grassland ecosystem, the EcoC-G is capable of simulating the impacts of herders' livelihood behaviors on grassland ecosystems. If timely grassland management strategies are implemented, it is possible to relieve the ecosystem pressure and improve the livelihood of local herders. The specific scenario simulation results are: (1) Under the current grassland management mode, the pasture could never be overgrazed, and herders could achieve the basic living standard, but the accumulated wealth decreased due to the decline of livestock. (2) With grazing control, herders can accumulate wealth by increasing the breeding amount and reducing the marketing rate, but the ecosystem consumption pressure can reach a maximum of 2.3 times. (3) With strict restrictions on the livestock number, the pressure on the ecosystem decreases; however, herders might not achieve basic living standards. (4) Modest regulation leads to rational ecological consumption intervals, meaning the ecosystem pressure will become stable and herders can gradually accumulate wealth with the achievement of basic living standards in advance. © 2019 by the authors.",Agent-based modeling (ABM); Ecosystem pressure; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem services consumption; Net primary productivity,MDPI,scopus-autonomous
Informed consent in direct-to-consumer personal genome testing: The outline of a model between specific and generic consent,Bunnik E.M.; Janssens A.C.J.W.; Schermer M.H.N.,2014,10.1111/bioe.12004,"Broad genome-wide testing is increasingly finding its way to the public through the online direct-to-consumer marketing of so-called personal genome tests. Personal genome tests estimate genetic susceptibilities to multiple diseases and other phenotypic traits simultaneously. Providers commonly make use of Terms of Service agreements rather than informed consent procedures. However, to protect consumers from the potential physical, psychological and social harms associated with personal genome testing and to promote autonomous decision-making with regard to the testing offer, we argue that current practices of information provision are insufficient and that there is a place - and a need - for informed consent in personal genome testing, also when it is offered commercially. The increasing quantity, complexity and diversity of most testing offers, however, pose challenges for information provision and informed consent. Both specific and generic models for informed consent fail to meet its moral aims when applied to personal genome testing. Consumers should be enabled to know the limitations, risks and implications of personal genome testing and should be given control over the genetic information they do or do not wish to obtain. We present the outline of a new model for informed consent which can meet both the norm of providing sufficient information and the norm of providing understandable information. The model can be used for personal genome testing, but will also be applicable to other, future forms of broad genetic testing or screening in commercial and clinical settings. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer; Generic consent; Genetic testing; Informed consent; Personal genome testing; Specific consent,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,scopus-autonomous
The organization of innovation and market dynamics: Managing increasing returns in software firms,Van Den Ende J.; Wijnberg N.,2003,10.1109/TEM.2003.817286,"Many contemporary markets, particularly markets of information technology products and information services, are characterized by increasing returns, including those resulting from bandwagon and network effects. At the same time, in larger firms, innovation often takes place in distinct units that are semi-autonomous and that have the responsibility for more than one phase in the product development process. In the most extreme case, a separate profit center is created within which research and development (R&D), production, marketing, and related activities are fully integrated and that has its own responsibility for external relations: an internal innovative venture. The central issue in this paper is the relation between the way firms organize their innovative activities and the market dynamics caused by bandwagon and network effects. We focus on the decision-making actors and we propose a categorization of causes of increasing returns and definitions of bandwagon and network effects that are consistent with this aim. We investigate the extent of internal autonomy of the unit, the extent of the integration of R&D, marketing and other activities in the product development process, and the extent of external autonomy. Three cases of projects creating software products, two of them in the same firm, demonstrate that the organization of innovation and the dynamics of the market are mutually dependent. More in particular, we hold that higher autonomy of teams, particularly in managing external relations, is important to cope with and manage bandwagon and network effects.",Autonomy of project teams; Bandwagon effects; Increasing returns; Network effects; Organization of innovation,,scopus-autonomous
One-to-many matching and section-based formulation of autonomous ridesharing equilibrium,Noruzoliaee M.; Zou B.,2022,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.002,"This paper models autonomous ridesharing — multiple travelers simultaneously riding one shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) — in a network equilibrium setting with mixed SAV and human-driven vehicle (HV) traffic. We make two major methodological contributions. First, a novel one (SAV)-to-many (riders) matching is proposed to characterize the waiting times of an SAV and multiple travelers who share rides in the SAV during online matching, which is a nontrivial generalization of the one-to-one matching without ridesharing. Our matching characterization considers the possibilities of a traveler matched with an SAV starting from the same origin, whereto the SAV moved unoccupied as a result of either pickup or relocation, or with an in-service SAV that goes through the traveler's origin. Second, a section-based formulation for SAV ridesharing user equilibrium is introduced to characterize the SAV traveler flow, which accommodates the possibility that an SAV traveler's itinerary (OD pair) is different from that of the serving SAV and other travelers in the SAV. Unlike the existing link and route based ridesharing formulations, the notion of section both prevents undesired traveler en-route transfer(s) and allows travelers of multiple ODs to share rides, meanwhile respecting the SAV seat capacity constraint. In addition to the above two methodological contributions, the optimal SAV fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation (to in-service, pickup, and relocation states) decisions of a transportation network company (TNC) are formulated. The TNC decisions anticipate traveler reactions as characterized by a new multimodal autonomous ridesharing user equilibrium (MARUE), which is put forward with a proof of its existence and finds the endogenous market shares and road congestion effects of SAV/HV. Original insights are obtained from model implementation, including substantial systemwide benefit of ridesharing, marginal benefit of relocation in the presence of ridesharing, and diminishing economies of SAV size. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Endogenous market share; Network congestion; One-to-many matching; Section-based ridesharing equilibrium; Shared autonomous vehicle,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-autonomous
Development of the descriptive binary model and its application for identification of clumps of toxic cyanobacteria,Nosov K.; Zholtkevych G.; Georgiyants M.; Vysotska O.; Balym Y.; Porvan A.,2017,10.15587/1729-4061.2017.108285,"In the paper, a descriptive model of system dynamics for binary data is presented. Binary or dichotomous data are widely spread across various fields of research - in decision making and data mining, marketing, solving of many natural, social and technical problems. The initial data for building the model is a set of states of an autonomous dynamical system with components taking binary values. At the same time, the time order of the states is permissible. The following objectives were stated: to identify the relationships between the components of the system defining its dynamics; on the basis of the identified dynamics, to recover the true order of the system states; to apply the developed model to the problem of visual identification of cyanobacteria in water areas using digital photography. To solve the problem, we used a mathematical model that enables to describe the relationships between components and transitions between the system states at a simple-forunderstanding level. The principle of parsimony underlies the model. According to this principle, the most appropriate model is described by the simplest relations in the sense defined in the work. As the case study, the problem of recognizing clumps of cyanobacteria from digital satellite imagery was considered. This is a complex, practically important problem that does not have a satisfactory experimental and theoretical solution at the moment. Applying system approaches to the measured colorimetric parameters of digital photography, we developed the index for identification of such clumps. This index uses the parameters of the digital RGB model of (various parts of) an image and allows us to reveal clumps of cyanobacteria on digital images obtained by aerospace methods. Additionally, digital photography can be performed in the conditions of insufficient visibility (due to precipitation, fog, and other factors), for imitation of which in the case study the original image was distorted by the digital noise. The studied model can find useful applications in the areas requiring binary dynamical data insights. © K. Nosov, G. Zholtkevych, M. Georgiyants, O. Vysotska, Y. Balym, A.

The new genetics and informed consent: Differentiating choice to preserve autonomy,Bunnik E.M.; de Jong A.; Nijsingh N.; de Wert G.M.W.R.,2013,10.1111/bioe.12030,"The advent of new genetic and genomic technologies may cause friction with the principle of respect for autonomy and demands a rethinking of traditional interpretations of the concept of informed consent. Technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and micro-array based analysis enable genome-wide testing for many heterogeneous abnormalities and predispositions simultaneously. This may challenge the feasibility of providing adequate pre-test information and achieving autonomous decision-making. At a symposium held at the 11th World Congress of Bioethics in June 2012 (Rotterdam), organized by the International Association of Bioethics, these challenges were presented for three different areas in which these so-called 'new genetics' technologies are increasingly being applied: newborn screening, prenatal screening strategies and commercial personal genome testing. In this article, we build upon the existing ethical framework for a responsible set-up of testing and screening offers and reinterpret some of its criteria in the light of the new genetics. As we will argue, the scope of a responsible testing or screening offer should align with the purpose(s) of testing and with the principle of respect for autonomy for all stakeholders involved, including (future) children. Informed consent is a prerequisite but requires a new approach. We present preliminary and general directions for an individualized or differentiated set-up of the testing offer and for the informed consent process. With this article we wish to contribute to the formation of new ideas on how to tackle the issues of autonomy and informed consent for (public) healthcare and direct-to-consumer applications of the new genetics. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer genetic testing; Informed consent; Neonatal screening; New genetics; Personal genome testing; Prenatal screening,,scopus-autonomous
What factors determine the intention to use and recommend public autonomous shuttles in a real-life setting?,Quinones M.; Romero J.; Schmitz A.; Díaz-Martín A.M.,2024,10.1108/EJMBE-07-2023-0224,"Purpose: User acceptance is a necessary precondition to implementing self-driving buses as a solution to public transport challenges. Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications: This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value: While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment. © 2024, Myriam Quinones, Jaime Romero, Anne Schmitz and Ana M.

Trust and intention to use autonomous vehicles: Manufacturer focus and passenger control,Waung M.; McAuslan P.; Lakshmanan S.,2021,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.004,"Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research has focused on public acceptance of and intention to use AVs, with trust emerging as important to these variables. Research on AV trust has centered on trust in vehicle performance. However, trust evaluation may include AV manufacturers and developers, and regulation pertaining to AVs; thus, we expand our measurement of trust to include beliefs based on manufacturers and regulation. In this experiment, we manipulate information regarding manufacturer focus (i.e., an emphasis on standards, regulations, and research (SRR) versus speed to market) to determine its effect on trust. When information focused on SRR, we found higher levels of trust in AV performance and in manufacturers, compared to when it focused on speed to market. In addition, information regarding passenger control (i.e., the ability to take over for the vehicle and to determine privacy settings) was manipulated to yield either high or low passenger control conditions. Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AVs was lowest when speed to market was emphasized and when passenger control was low. Furthermore, trust was tested as a mediator between perceived risk and BI. Trust in AV performance partially mediated the relationship between perceived AV performance risk and BI. In addition, trust in AV regulation partially mediated the relationship between AV privacy/security risk and BI. Researchers should continue to examine trust beyond the AV itself to encompass trust in manufacturers and regulations. Those designing and marketing AVs should carefully consider decisions that influence manufacturer/developer reputation and passenger control due to their effect on intention to use AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Autonomous vehicles; Mental models; Passenger control; Perceived risk; Trust,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-autonomous
Use and efficiency of social media. An analysis from the social economy; [Uso y eficiencia de la social media. Un análisis desde la economía social],Uclés D.F.; Moral A.M.; Jurado E.B.; Viruel M.J.M.,2016,,"Introduction Co-operative societies have not been untouched by the social and technological phenomenon that has exploded online throughout the beginning of the century, which has connected millions of people and has had an undeniable impact on society. We are, of course, talking about online social networks. Specifically, we focus on the organic products sector, which is also becoming of increasing importance to society, as reflected by the continuous development of the market and that of olive oil, in which Spain holds a position of some importance globally. Objectives Thus, the aim of this study is to focus on the analysis of the use of and penetration of these online tools within the organic olive business community, with special focus on the entities in the Social Economy, the vast majority of which are co-operative societies. Design The population studied consists of organic entities that are processors and marketers of olive oil in Andalusia, registered in the Sistema de Informacion de la Produccion Ecologica de la Junta de Andalucia (The Autonomous Government of Andalusia Organic Production Information System, SIPEA). A structured telephone survey was carried out on this population, specifically aimed at the management of these 'organic olive oil processing and marketing' entities, where information on the use and commitment of the organisation was collected by the ICTs. Also, a checkpoint was created containing key account metrics of the organisations with accounts in the online social networks Facebook and Twitter. Other detailed statistics are also included in this checkpoint, obtained from analysing these accounts with on-line tools specialised in online social networks such as LikeAlyzer and Twitonomy. Methodology To determine the impact and penetration of the ICT, descriptive statistics were utilised, and then, a more comprehensive analysis of online social networks was conducted using the DEA method (Data Envelopment Analysis). DEA methodology, both nonparametric and deterministic, aims to measure the efficiency of a set of homogeneous decision-making units (DMU) using linear programming to compare identical inputs and outputs, to obtain a ranking efficiency (Samoilenko, 2014). Specifically, the variables that determine the efficiency levels considered as inputs and outputs of the model are the main metrics obtained on the use and success of the organisations in online social networks. In this way, the main activity indicators that reveal the use and development of these tools by the organisations have been used as inputs. The main monitoring indicators, which reflect the popularity of these accounts in online social networks serve as the outputs. The high level of sensitivity of the DEA method to outliers makes this one of the main weaknesses of the method (Wilson, 1995). To solve this problem we have used the super-efficiency method, detecting and removing observations contaminated by noise, which produces more accurate results and a more accurate classification efficiency (Banker and Chang, 2006). Results In a first analysis of the use of ICT by organic olive organisations, it is observed that the existing differences between the two types of organisations, SCA and SAT as compared with other legal forms, are not relevant regarding the presence of a website or the use of e-commerce. In relation to the use of virtual social networks, 53.74 percent of organisational leaders confirm they make regular use of these platforms. Discriminating between entities of the social economy and other legal forms shows us that 37.50 percent of co-operative societies and SAT report using these platforms. This is in comparison to 61.62 percent of other legal forms, representing a more than 24 percentage point difference between the two groups. On the other hand, although capitalist entities make greater use of virtual social networks, on average, they are less efficient in their usage of such platforms, compared with organisations in the Social Economy. Thus, the results obtained after using the DEA method show us that, considering the variable returns to scale (BCC model), 76.92 percent of co-operative societies and SAT are more efficient in online social networks, compared to 23.08 percent of the remaining legal forms. This increased efficiency is also maintained in the CCR model. Therefore, and in line with other investigations, this confirms that co-operative societies and online SATs use online social networks in a way that is more geared towards transactional rather than relational purposes (Lopez et al., 2012; Montegut et al., 2013; Munoz and Tirado, 2014), although their social nature is advantageous for them on platforms such as online social networks. Conclusions The differences between entities belonging to the Social Economy and other legal forms with respect to the use of websites or online stores are not significant. However, it is confirmed that the organic olive co-operative entities and their SAT counterparts clearly lag in the use of online social networks. In general, these platforms are largely undervalued by the business community in this entire sector. The inflexibility of co-operative societies in adapting to the changing environment and, in particular, to technological changes (COGECA, 2010), is considered a clear explanatory factor in these results. This is due to increasing awareness of its importance as the business use of online social networks is a relatively recent phenomenon. According to Bridges et al. (2010), greater market orientation and integration of co-operative societies is necessary, which will stimulate the commitment to online social networks. Furthermore, the results show that the SCA and SAT are entities that are more efficient in their use of these online platforms. We believe the main supporting factor for this is the aforementioned confluence of values between the Social Economy and Web 2.0. The relevance of communication within co-operative societies (Herranz, 2007) has made the Internet an indispensable yet still underrated tool. In this sense, the singular operational methods and characteristics of these entities (Mozas et al., 2015), makes the use of online social networks, an economic, simple and affordable media, which could be extremely useful for them. Therefore, the social identity that co-operative societies present and transmit gives them an advantage in online media, which results in an extremely efficient method of achieving greater popularity with a lesser degree of effort. As the main limitation of the study addressed the sectoral nature of the investigation, this makes it difficult to generalise about all entities in the Social Economy. However, given the scarcity of related studies, this research is a clear starting point for extending the analysis to other industries and institutions such as co-operative societies of second degree and above. The timeliness and relevance of the issues addressed highlights the usefulness of this study.",DEA; Olive oil entities; Organic products; Social Economy; Social media,CIRIEC,scopus-autonomous
Strategy optimization of autonomous trade-in in the supply chain with considering consumer utility; [考虑消费者效用的供应链自主以旧换新策略优化],Hong-Yuan L.; Bo Y.; Yan-Ping L.,2019,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2019.01.016,"In the 21st century, facing with increasingly severe resource shortages and environmental pollution problems, the public has begun to change consumption concept and support green consumption actions initiated by the government and companies. Since the trade-in subsidy policy provided by government was canceled, companies have implemented trade-in on their own. As a method of competition, marketing strategy research pays more and more attention to trade-in, which shows many advantages such as benefiting the people, stimulating consumption and upgrading products. Currently, the studies of trade-in mainly focus on discussing the superiority when it is carried out by a single enterprise. The current study seldom analyzes trade-in systematically from supply chain perspective when it is implemented by different investors. In addition, whether an old customer buys a new product depends on the previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products. Existing studies have not considered the purchase decision characteristics of old customers. In this paper, the market is divided into two parts. One market is the new customer, and the other one is the old customer. The previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products are considered as two important factors when an old customer purchases a new product. This paper is based on the two-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer and a manufacturer. Trade-in policy implemented by retailer and manufacturer is constructed by considering customer utility to study strategic optimization of supply chain system. Firstly, decision-makings of supply chains of three strategic models are compared and analyzed to study their impact on customers. Secondly, the optimal path of supply chain strategy is provided and discussed from the perspective of business efficiency. Thirdly, the impact of market factors on supply chain efficiency of the optimal path adopted in the supply chain is discussed. Finally, by comparing consumer surpluses and social welfares of the three strategies, the social advantages of the adopted optimal path are studied. This study has four major research findings. First, trade-in strategy has a significant impact on product sales and corporate profits. The manufacturer or retailer can strive for greater profit by investing trade-in on his own initiative than before. That will be an obstacle to implementing trade-in strategy. Therefore, when making decisions the manufacturer should properly pay regard to the retailer, and then select a reasonable strategy according to the relationship between them, such as investing trade-in cooperatively. Second, whichever trade-in strategy is adopted in the market, external market (namely retail price, buy-back price, market demand and customer net utility remain stable. However, internal system (namely wholesale price) is obviously dependent on the investor. Third, trade-in strategy is difficult to benefit all parties under market segments. When it is beneficial to one side, it is bound to harm the other side. When the repurchase desire of old customer for a new product is small, the trade-in strategy can effectively strengthen the product stickiness of old customer; however, it can weaken the product's appeal to potential new customer. Fourth, in some cases trade-in strategy will reduce overall consumer surplus and total social welfare. Only when the old customer’s market share, the previous usage experience or the depreciation of old product is higher than a certain threshold, it can benefit all consumers and the society © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",Consumer utility; Social welfare; Strategy optimization; Supply chain; Trade-In,Zhejiang University,scopus-autonomous
Will Large DSO-Managed Group Practices Be the Predominant Setting for Oral Health Care by 2025? Two Viewpoints: Viewpoint 1: Large DSO-Managed Group Practices Will Be the Setting in Which the Majority of Oral Health Care Is Delivered by 2025 and Viewpoint 2: Increases in DSO-Managed Group Practices Will Be Offset by Models Allowing Dentists to Retain the Independence and Freedom of a Traditional Practice,"Cole J.R.; Dodge W.W.; Findley J.S.; Young S.K.; Horn B.D.; Kalkwarf K.L.; Martin M.M., Jr.; Winder R.L.",2015,10.1002/j.0022-0337.2015.79.5.tb05905.x,"This Point/Counterpoint article discusses the transformation of dental practice from the traditional solo/small-group (partnership) model of the 1900s to large Dental Support Organizations (DSO) that support affiliated dental practices by providing nonclinical functions such as, but not limited to, accounting, human resources, marketing, and legal and practice management. Many feel that DSO-managed group practices (DMGPs) with employed providers will become the setting in which the majority of oral health care will be delivered in the future. Viewpoint 1 asserts that the traditional dental practice patterns of the past are shifting as many younger dentists gravitate toward employed positions in large group practices or the public sector. Although educational debt is relevant in predicting graduates’ practice choices, other variables such as gender, race, and work-life balance play critical roles as well. Societal characteristics demonstrated by aging Gen Xers and those in the Millennial generation blend seamlessly with the opportunities DMGPs offer their employees. Viewpoint 2 contends the traditional model of dental care delivery—allowing entrepreneurial practitioners to make decisions in an autonomous setting—is changing but not to the degree nor as rapidly as Viewpoint 1 professes. Millennials entering the dental profession, with characteristics universally attributed to their generation, see value in the independence and flexibility that a traditional practice allows. Although DMGPs provide dentists one option for practice, several alternative delivery models offer current dentists and future dental school graduates many of the advantages of DMGPs while allowing them to maintain the independence and freedom a traditional practice provides. © American Dental Education Association",dental group practice; dentists; ownership; practice management; private practice; professional autonomy; professional practice location,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,scopus-autonomous
Integrating the customers’ perceived risks and benefits into the triple-channel retailing,Zhang W.-G.; Zhang Q.; Mizgier K.J.; Zhang Y.,2017,10.1080/00207543.2017.1336679,"Multiple channel retailing and channel selection strategy have become key issues for many corporations to place themselves at the heart of a new era of retailing. This paper studies a triple-channel system in which a manufacturer operates a conventional channel, a direct online channel, as well as increases its online presence with an online shopping platform. It also takes the heterogeneity of consumers’ price sensitivity and channel preferences into account. It highlights that the perceived risks and perceived benefits are aggregated into an inhibitor or activator entering the customers’ acceptance of triple channels and further affecting their purchasing decisions. Three cases are discussed to investigate the demand distributions, the profit behaviours, the optimal pricing strategies and the channel selection strategies. Theoretical analysis is further validated by a case study with the aid of agent-based modelling. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that two acceptance indices – respectively, regarded as the consumers’ willingness to tolerate the perceived risks of the online channel and approve the perceived benefits from the third-party online platform – significantly govern the total profit in two stylised scenarios. This study schematically characterises the structure of demand distributions, helps the corporation to discern consumers’ channel choices and then focus its marketing efforts towards more profitable customers and strategic channel structures. Furthermore, some implications are outlined for the optimal supply chain designation decision. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Agent-based simulation; Heterogeneous valuation; Multi-channel retailing; Perceived risk; Supply chain design,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-autonomous
Managerial perspective on regional marketing activities of destination management organizations (DMOs),Genç R.; Pirnar I.,2009,10.3727/108354210X12645141401386,"Destination management is an important competitive marketing method for global tourism destinations. Especially, when cooperated with image and brand management, it helps destinations to stand out from today's severe crowd of competition. The successful and efficient destination management companies usually play a major role in marketing their destinations, but there exists a conflict in literature on the level of involvement in related marketing activities. Though managing an autonomous organization having its' own budget and freedom in decision making seems to be the best solution to meet the rapidly changing trends and needs of global tourists, it needs to be analyzed within the organizations' managerial level.

"Pro-environmental, prosocial, pro-self, or does it depend? A more nuanced understanding of the motivations underlying residential solar panel adoption",Legault L.; Bird S.; Heintzelman M.D.,2024,10.1016/j.erss.2024.103481,"Although a small body of research has examined the motivational foundations of homeowners' decisions to adopt rooftop solar panels, in this research we compared adoptive and non-adoptive homeowners in the United States (N = 824) across a spectrum of values and motives to identify the most salient predictors of solar adoption within various demographic and political strata. Results of hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that autonomous (i.e., internal) pro-environmental motivation linked to solar adoption regardless of age, income, and education. In contrast, the effects of altruism and controlled (i.e., image and status based) environmental motivation depended on demographic characteristics. That is, altruism was positively associated with adoption for older homeowners, but negatively linked to adoption for younger homeowners. Additionally, controlled motivation predicted solar adoption for both younger and higher income homeowners, but it was not a predictor for older and lower income homeowners. We highlight the importance of assessing interactions between demographics, on one hand, and motives and values, on the other, in order to reveal nuances in the motivations of different types of adopters. These findings underscore the need for more targeted solar policy, marketing, and public messaging. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Demographics; Environmental motivation; Solar panel adoption; Values,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-autonomous
Aspect based sentiment analysis and smart classification in uncertain feedback pool,Kumar V.V.; Raghunath K.M.K.; Muthukumaran V.; Joseph R.B.; Beschi I.S.; Uday A.K.,2022,10.1007/s13198-021-01379-2,"The data used in the opinion can be either factual or subjective, or both. The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information.

Effect of shopper attributes on retail format choice behaviour for food and grocery retailing in India,Prasad C.J.; Aryasri A.R.,2011,10.1108/09590551111104486,"Purpose: Retailing in India is an unchartered territory. Food and grocery is the most promising area for setting up retail business in India. An understanding of shopper retail format choice behaviour will enable retailers to segment their market and target specific consumer groups with strategies premeditated to meet their retail needs. The purpose of this paper is to make a detailed study on the effect of shoppers' demographic, geographic and psychographic dimensions in terms of format choice behaviour in the fast growing Indian food and grocery retailing. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research design is adopted applying mall intercept survey method using structured questionnaire for data collection. Both descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistical tools like χ2, factor analysis and multivariate analysis are used to analyse the data collected from 1,040 food and grocery retail customers from upgraded neighbourhood kirana stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets in conjoint cities of Secunderabad and Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh in India. Findings: The findings suggest that shoppers' age, gender, occupation, education, monthly household income, family size and distance travelled to store have significant association with retail format choice decisions. The choice decisions are also varied among shoppers' demographic attributes. The findings from shoppers' psychographic dimensions like values, lifestyle factors and shopping orientations resulted in segmentation of food and grocery retail consumers into hedonic, utilitarian, autonomous, conventional and socialization type. Practical implications: The study has practical implications for food and grocery retailers for better understanding the shopper behaviour in the context of changing consumer demographic and psychographic characteristics in an emerging Indian retail market. The findings may help the retailers to segment and target the food and grocery retail consumers and, as a consequence, to undertake more effective retail marketing strategies for competitive advantage. Originality/value: Given the absence of published academic literature and empirical findings relating to store format choice behaviour in food and grocery retailing in India, this study may serve as a departure point for future studies in this area of concern.

Madeira Island - Destination image and tourists loyalty,Machado L.P.; Santos C.M.; Sarmento M.,2009,,"This study uses a Logit model to examine the probability of the image of the tourism destination Madeira, a Portuguese autonomous insular region, being strengthened after the tourists's visit to the destination. The results of the empirical study are based on a survey carried out to tourists during their visit to the island of Madeira, between March and July 2008. The model confirms that the probability of enhancing Madeira's tourism destination image after the visit is explained by several independent variables, gathered from the literature review. The findings of the study intend to call local authorities's attention to the importance of repeated tourists due to the impact that their enhanced image of Madeira may have on the economic sustainability of the destination and on the potential savings in promotion investment. This happens because the client's loyalty brings a high return of the destination's marketing investment. The conclusions can also help the decision makers of the tourism sector of the island of Madeira to better plan their destination marketing activities.",Destination image; Loyalty; Satisfaction; Service quality; Sustainability,Varna University of Management,scopus-autonomous
A framework of opinion dynamics using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples,Giráldez-Cru J.; Chica M.; Cordón O.,2021,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107559,"Opinion dynamics investigate the spreading and evolution of opinions among a set of individuals. This is especially relevant in decision-making — the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options —, that is commonly based on personal opinions which may evolve along time. In this work, we present a model of opinion dynamics where opinions are represented using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples, a realistic representation of imprecise information. In our framework, the propagation of opinions in the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes. Additionally, we use a social network to represent agents’ interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). Our opinion dynamics model can be easily integrated into an agent-based system to how opinions spread and evolve. Experimental results show the impact of the communication processes, the social network topology, the awareness deactivation mechanism, and the agents’ influence on the opinion dynamics of others. Furthermore, we present two case studies of our opinion dynamics model applied to marketing and politics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples; Opinion dynamics; Social networks,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-autonomous

Using multiple agent-based simulation techniques, we investigated the relative importance of three widely adopted seeding strategies (seeding influentials, early adopters, and random targets) in a competitive market in which products are vertically differentiated in terms of quality and brand strength. We found robust evidence that the finding of an optimal seeding strategy depends on consumers' propensity to spread negative WOM. When negative WOM propensity is low, seeding influentials outperform seeding early adopters or random targets. When negative WOM propensity is high, decision-making about an optimal seeding strategy relies on the relative quality and brand strength of the product and the focal firm's objective. In particular, if a product's relative quality is low, seeding early adopters is the optimal seeding strategy in terms of both market share (MS) and net present value (NPV); if the product's relative quality is equal, seeding early adopters is most effective for increasing MS, while seeding influentials is the best for increasing NPV; and if the product's relative quality is high, seeding influentials is the optimal strategy, except that for products with strong brand strength and firm aims at maximizing the MS growth. We conclude the paper by discussing its theoretical contributions and managerial relevance for decision support. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based modeling; Market competition; New product marketing; Product seeding; Word-of-mouth,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-autonomous
Integrating autonomy in public health messaging,Murphy K.; Graham D.; Faries M.,2024,10.3389/fcomm.2024.1346031,"The COVID-19 pandemic and related rise of public distrust has called personal autonomy in health messaging into question, drawing attention to two competing forms of health messaging—communicating to persuade versus to inform. Communicating to persuade utilizes marketing techniques to promote behavior change whereas communicating to inform focuses on providing information to facilitate informed decision-making. Communicating to inform is supported by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that autonomy, coupled with competence and relatedness, is a basic psychological need, relevant to making health-decisions and maintaining behavior change. This study aims to assess the above mentioned dynamics of SDT in health messaging through the development of an autonomous scale and assessment criteria. The purpose of the scale is to guide the development of health messaging that aims to communicate to inform (autonomy-enhancing) rather than communicating to persuade or coerce the audience into adopting a specific health behavior (autonomy-diminishing). The results of the study suggest that individual perception of autonomy in health messaging is influenced by a variety of factors. As such, the criteria outlined in this scale can be used as a guide to develop health messaging that purposefully integrates and supports autonomy-enhancing principles.

From Gambelli to Placanica to a European framework for remote gaming,Keuleers E.,2005,10.1016/j.clsr.2005.06.003,"This article reviews the difficulties facing national courts in respect of the regulation of online gambling activity in the wake of two recent decisions of the European Court of Justice that, in mixed messages, may be moving towards liberalization of the European gaming market. More than a year after the Gambelli and Lindman decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the first report of the European Commission on the application of the electronic commerce Directive, the impact of these recent European (r)evolutions for the gaming industry has not always been very clear. In the Netherlands and Belgium, existing jurisprudence was confirmed in the so-called post-Gambelli decisions. In Germany, where most of the competences to regulate gaming activities have been attributed to the autonomous Länder, some courts have recognized that, in the absence of a consistent gaming policy, the imposed restrictions on the cross-border provision of gaming services could not be justified by the imperative reasons of public order. In Spain, the Loterías y Apuestas del Estado (LAE) is maintaining its position that it has the exclusive right to offer and promote games on the Internet. In Italy, a regional court has had to refer a gaming case to European Court of Justice (ECJ). The conclusion of one year post-Gambelli case-law is that the Gambelli and Lindman requirements are applied in a very diverging manner. In the Dutch Betfair appeal case, it was even insinuated that Gambelli was not relevant! Before commenting on these national decisions, the Gambelli and Lindman decisions will be reviewed again. © 2005 Ewout Keuleers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Analytical target cascading for multi-level supply chain decisions in cloud perspective,Huang Y.; Gao K.; Wang K.; Lv H.; Gao F.,2022,10.1108/IMDS-06-2021-0402,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt a three-stage cloud-based management system for optimizing greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and marketing decisions with supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain with multiple suppliers, one single manufacturer and multiple retailers. Design/methodology/approach: The manufacturer purchases optional components of a certain functionality from his alternative suppliers and customizes a set of platform products for retailers in different independent market segments. To tackle the studied problem, a hierarchical analytical target cascading (ATC) model is proposed, Jaya algorithm is applied and supplier selection and product family design are implemented in its encoding procedure. Findings: A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the ATC model in solving the optimization problem and the corresponding algorithm. It has shown that the ATC model can not only obtain close optimization results as a central optimization method but also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. Originality/value: This paper first develops a three-stage cloud-based management system to optimize GHG emission, marketing decisions, supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain.

"Investigating the Effect of Use and Social Cues in Food Advertisements on Attention, Feelings of Social Support, and Purchase Intention",Liu J.; Bailey R.L.,2020,10.1080/10410236.2019.1654174,"In an effort to understand how different types of food cues in food ads are automatically encouraging unhealthy eating behaviors, the current study examined how the presence of actual food consumption behaviors (use cues) and presence of multiple individuals indorsing food products (social cues) in fast food ads would influence individual attentional and behavioral responses. A use cue (2) x social cue (2) x repetition (3) fully within-subjects factorial design experiment with young adults (N = 164) was conducted. Findings demonstrated that participants paid greater attention to the fast food ads which contained multiple people (group cue) eating the advertised food products (use cue) when compared to other types of fast food ads. In addition, participants also self-reported greater social support and purchase intention when seeing use and group cues in ads. Understanding how these cues function in food advertising to encourage unhealthy eating may help health practitioners and individuals create more helpful intervention strategies. Further, applying these marketing tactics to ads for food products that are healthier (i.e., less energy dense and more nutrient dense) may help to maximize healthy food palatability, thereby increasing motivation for viewers to make autonomous decisions about eating healthier. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Routledge,scopus-autonomous
Application of sustainability principles for harsh environment exploration by autonomous robot,Bausys R.; Cavallaro F.; Semenas R.,2019,10.3390/su11092518,"Currently, the European Union (EU) is focusing on a large-scale campaign dedicated to developing a competitive circular economy and expanding the single digital market. One of the main goals of this campaign is the implementation of the sustainability principles in the development and deployment cycle of the new generation technologies. This paper focuses on the fast-growing field of autonomous mobile robots and the harsh environment exploration problem. Currently, most state-of-the-art navigation methods are utilising the idea of evaluating candidate observation locations by combining different task-related criteria. However, these map building solutions are often designed for operating in near-perfect environments, neglecting such factors as the danger to the robot. In this paper, a new strategy that aims to address the safety and re-usability of the autonomous mobile agent by implementing the economic sustainability principles is proposed. A novel multi-criteria decision-making method ofWeighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment-Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets, namely WASPAS-SVNS, and the weight selection method of Step-Wise Weights Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) are applied to model a dynamic decision-making system. The experimental evaluation of the proposed strategy shows that increased survivability of the autonomous agent can be observed. Compared to the greedy baseline strategy, the proposed method forms the movement path which orients the autonomous agent away from dangerous obstacles. © 2019 by the authors.",Autonomous robot; Harsh environment; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neutrosophic sets; Sustainability; SWARA; WASPAS-SVNS,MDPI,scopus-autonomous
The Individual Aspect of Interorganizational Cooperation: Favor-Based Cooperation,Nguyen A.,2020,10.1080/1051712X.2020.1787025,"Purpose: Interorganizational (IO) cooperation has been examined primarily as a role-based concept. This research seeks to extend this concept by examining a distinct mode of IO cooperation: favor-based cooperation. This concept refers to voluntary exchanges of preferential treatments between boundary personnel across organizations that are perceived as going beyond the requirements of their role relationships. Methodology/Approach: A qualitative case research design is used to build a grounded theoretical framework on favor-based cooperation. The empirical basis of the proposed framework includes around 300 favor incidents gathered through multiple sources to get a broad and balanced view of the phenomenon. Theoretically, the author employs role theory to conceptualize favor-based cooperation as qua persona, extra-role behavior; additionally, he draws on transaction cost economics (TCE) to examine the value of favor-based cooperation as a means of adaptation relative to TCE relational contracting. Findings: As an extra-role behavior, the added value of favor-based cooperation lies in its capability to provide extra flexibility in the system via informal consent to adaptation requests and preferred access to exchange partner’s time availability. But this mode of cooperation involves a high risk of opportunism when a lot is at stake. Thus, favor-based cooperation best suits IO exchanges that require highly frequent but lowly consequential coordinated adaptation and can enhance IO value creation beyond role-based cooperation (relational contracting) in these situations. Since favor-based cooperation involves transgressing the market forces, it ill-suits IO exchanges that require autonomous adaptations. As a qua persona behavior, favor-based cooperation first and foremost serves the interests of the individuals involved. Thus, whereas interorganizational interest alignment provides sufficient incentive for beneficial role-based cooperation to occur, beneficial favor-based cooperation also requires organizational-individual interest alignment. Research Implications: The inclusion of the favor-based cooperation concept in the study of IO cooperation helps address the overlooked individual aspect of IO cooperation. In the role-based approach that is typical in research on IO cooperation, boundary personnel are viewed as organizational agents who act to maximize their respective organizational interests. In viewing IO cooperation as qua persona behavior (as in the case of favor-based cooperation), the current research explicitly accounts for boundary personnel’s individual interests. While individual interests do account for certain harmful behaviors (e.g., buying business or covering poor performance), they also account for beneficial behaviors that have not been adequately accounted for in role-based theories of IO cooperation. For example, it is individual interests (e.g., the desire to help a friend) that motivate some boundary persons to exert extra efforts to accommodate exchange partner’s unplanned requests for adaptation. Accordingly, knowledge of how the individual interests of the decision-makers affect IO cooperative activities and the outcomes of these activities (via, e.g., favor behaviors) can enhance the explanatory power of theories of cooperation. For example, favor-based cooperation is beneficial particularly in certain exchange situations where role-based cooperation (TCE relational contracting) will likely fail, such as exchange situations that require highly frequent (but lowly consequential) coordinated adaptations. Knowledge of how boundary personnel’s individual interests affect IO cooperation and its outcomes via favor behaviors is also relevant for the understanding of the incentive required for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. According to the role-based view, boundary personnel’s personal motivation is irrelevant. Accordingly, IO interest alignment established via, e.g., mutual credible commitment provides sufficient incentive for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. But to the extent that boundary personnel’s individual interests are relevant, IO interest alignment is necessary but insufficient; organizational-individual interest alignment within each participating organization is also needed for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. Practical Implications: Findings have implications for the role of favor-based cooperation in organizations and effective management of this mode of cooperation. While many organizations appear to value favor-based cooperation, its role is not without controversy, as some scholars view it as harmful behavior that should be discouraged. The findings of this research support a balanced view. Favor-based cooperation is an ultra-flexible means of coordinated adaptation that can help organizations respond effectively to accelerating change in their business environment. However, favor-based cooperation may not be the optimal cooperative mechanism when a lot is at stake; thus, in most exchange situations it should play only a supplemental role. Moreover, this mode of cooperation involves a high probability of misuse. Findings yield unobtrusive measures for effective management of favor exchanges. To benefit from these informal and discretionary cooperative activities, organizations need to develop organizational-individual interest alignment by economic and social incentives. They need to provide boundary personnel with decision criteria to help them select and structure beneficial favor exchange opportunities, and sufficient discretion and resources to realize these opportunities. Originality/Value/Contribution: This research extends the role-based IO cooperation concept to include favor-based cooperation–a qua persona and extra-role behavior. To the author’s knowledge, this research is the first in-depth investigation of this mode of IO cooperation. The findings highlight the distinct scope of favor-based cooperation, specify its added value and downsides as a means of adaptation, and explain the incentive required for beneficial favor-based cooperation to occur. Given that TCE currently has a prominent role in the IO marketing literature, by specifying the value of favor-based cooperation relative to TCE modes of cooperation the current research helps position favor-based cooperation within mainstream IO marketing research. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",adaptation; business marketing; extra-role behavior; favor exchange; industrial marketing; Interorganizational cooperation; relational contracting; social exchange; transaction cost economics; value creation,Routledge,scopus-autonomous
The influence of gender in the management of the corporate communication case study in Aragón (Spain); [La influencia del género en el management de la comunicación corporativa estudio de caso en Aragón (España)],Iniesta-Alemán I.; Marta-Lazo C.; Ruiz-Del Olmo F.J.,2018,,"We analyze the changes in the management of corporate communication due to the influence of new technologies, using as a case study the market of advertising agencies in the Autonomous Community of Aragon (Spain). In order to determine if the gender of those in management positions of the advertisers influences the way of managing the new business environment, a descriptive analysis was carried out using the focus group as a research technique. As a study variable, gender was selected, so two different sessions were held, one with men and the other with women, in order to analyze the characteristics of the advertiser vs. agency relationship. The main conclusion we reached in this research is that there is a different interest for men and women in relation to the different parameters of analysis. While men paid more attention to external competitiveness and the need to react quickly and forcefully to changes, women were more concerned about the disappearance of interdepartmental borders and the way marketing decisions are made. © 2018 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada.

Examining the needs to adopt big data analytics in B2B organizations: development of propositions and model of needs,Ram J.; Zhang Z.,2022,10.1108/JBIM-10-2020-0464,"Purpose: Big data analytics (BDA) is becoming a strategic tool to harness data to achieve business efficiencies. While business-to-customer organizations have adopted BDA, its adoption in business-to-business (B2B) has been slow, raising concerns about the lack of understanding of the need to adopt BDA. Little knowledge exists on the subject and the purpose of this study is to examine BDA adoption needs among B2B organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) following the six-step SLR guidelines of Templier and Paré (2015) involved 1,051 articles, which were content analyzed. Findings: The authors offer two-pronged findings. First, on the basis of the SLR, the authors develop a new four-category classification scheme of needs to adopt BDA and present a consolidated review of the current knowledge base along with these categories (i.e. innovation, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and digital transformation). Second, underpinned by the theory of organizational motivation and literature evidence, the authors develop propositions and a corresponding model of BDA adoption needs. The authors show that BDA adoption among B2B organizations is driven by the need to augment customer lifetime value, champion the change, improve managerial decision cycle-time, tap into social media benefits and align with market transformation. Research limitations/implications: The results facilitate theory development as the study creates a new classification scheme of needs and a model of needs to adopt BDA in large B2B organizations. Practical implications: The findings will serve as a guideline framework for managers to examine their BDA adoption needs and strategize its adoption. Originality/value: The study develops a new four-category classification scheme for understanding B2B organizations’ needs to adopt big data analytics.

Evaluate the sustainable marketing strategy to optimal online leasing of new energy vehicles under the background big data economy,Daifen T.,2022,10.1108/JEIM-02-2021-0087,"Purpose: Under the big data background, there are many influencing factors for investors of new energy vehicles (NEV), and government subsidies promote the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to provide solutions for the sustainable development of NEV. Design/methodology/approach: The sustainable marketing strategy of NEV in China is put forward. This paper first analyzes the subsidy policy effect of NEV under the background of big data. It then establishes the online optimal leasing strategy under multiple strategy choices and the online leasing strategy of multiple vehicles under the inflation market. Findings: With the fixed cost of NEV in each lease period, the optimal competition ratio of online decision-makers will continue to decrease with the increase of the difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies. In the decision-making of renting and purchasing multiple vehicles, the general strategy competition ratio is 2.922, while the optimal competition ratio of the online renting and purchasing strategy proposed by the research is 2.723. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the limited data and information collected, so the optimal decision-making model has some limitations. The authors need to find more representative data to optimize the model. Practical implications: As an emerging industry, NEV have developed rapidly in recent years. Based on the online algorithm and competitive ratio theory, this paper solves the decision-making problem of operators and gives the optimal strategy to promote the green development of the new energy vehicle industry.

“Hacking marketing”: how do firms develop marketers' expertise and practices in a digital era?,Hafezieh N.; Pollock N.; Ryan A.,2023,10.1108/JEIM-12-2021-0530,"Purpose: Digital technologies, digitalised consumers and the torrent of customer data have been transforming marketing practice. In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts. Findings: Drawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a ‘hacking marketing’ approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries. Practical implications: This study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study’s results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Digitalised consumers; Expertise; Hacking; Occupations; Practice,Emerald Publishing,scopus-big data

Drivers of Big Data Analytics&#x2019; Adoption and Implications of Management Decision-Making on Big Data Adoption and Firms&#x2019; Financial and Nonfinancial Performance: Evidence From Nigeria&#x0027;s Manufacturing and Service Industries,Egwuonwu A.; Mendy J.; Smart-Oruh E.; Egwuonwu A.,2023,10.1109/TEM.2023.3321426,"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms&#x2019; financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria&#x0027;s. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig.&#x00A0;1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management&#x0027;s post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study&#x0027;s findings were used to develop Fig.&#x00A0;2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management&#x0027;s support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study&#x0027;s hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE&#x0027;s critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management&#x0027;s decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations&#x2019; FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context. The implications and limitations are discussed.

Differential effects of firm generated content on consumer digital engagement and firm performance: An outside-in perspective,Cheng M.; Liu J.; Qi J.; Wan F.,2021,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.07.001,"Social media contains a massive amount of information, which provides researchers and practitioners with an invaluable source of data to conduct research from end-users' perspectives, in order to influence firm strategic choices. Although an extensive amount of research has been developed in B2C and B2B marketing context, few social media studies take a dive into potential linkages between external and internal marketing contexts in an industry specific paradigm. This study aims to bridge B2C and B2B social media marketing, by adopting the outside-in perspective as theoretical lens. Using a large-scale dataset, collected from a micro-blogging site, and consumer-oriented information assembled from multiple sources, we empirically examine the inter-relationship between firm-generated messages, consumer digital engagement, and firm sales performance in the movie industry. Theoretically, this study builds upon the outside-in perspective and extends the current knowledge of the outside-in perspective to the social media context. It also bridges the B2C and B2B marketing literature by demonstrating that the insight garnered from B2C social media interactions should be integrated into the B2B firm interactions, communications, and decision makings. Managerially, this study provides movie practitioners with important implications. © 2021",Big data analysis; Consumer digital engagement; Firm-generated content; Outside-in perspective; Social media,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-big data
Identifying influencers on social media,Harrigan P.; Daly T.M.; Coussement K.; Lee J.A.; Soutar G.N.; Evers U.,2021,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102246,"The increased availability of social media big data has created a unique challenge for marketing decision-makers; turning this data into useful information. One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers. These findings have the potential to improve influencer identification effectiveness and efficiency, and thus improve influencer marketing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Influencers; Market mavens; Social media; Twitter,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
Implementing big data analytics in marketing departments: Mixing organic and administered approaches to increase data-driven decision making,Johnson D.S.; Sihi D.; Muzellec L.,2021,10.3390/informatics8040066,"This study examines the experience of marketing departments to become fully data-driven decision-making organizations. We evaluate an organic approach of departmental sensemaking and an administered approach by which top management increase the influence of analytics skilled employees. Data collection commenced with 15 depth interviews of marketing and analytics professionals in the US and Europe involved in the implementation of big data analytics (BDA) and was followed by a survey data of 298 marketing and analytics middle management professionals at United States based firms. The survey data supports the logic that BDA sensemaking is initiated by top management and is comprised of four primary activities: external knowledge acquisition, improving digitized data quality, big data analytics experimentation and big data analytics information dissemination. Top management drives progress toward data-driven decision-making by facilitating sensemaking and by increasing the influence of BDA skilled employees. This study suggests that while a shift toward enterprise analytics increases the quality of resource available to the marketing department, this approach could stymie the quality of marketing insights gained from BDA. This study presents a model of how to improve the quality of marketing insights and improve data-driven decision-making. © 2021 by the authors.

APPLICATION OF PYTHON IN MARKETING EDUCATION: A BIG DATA ANALYTICS PERSPECTIVE,Teimourzadeh A.; Kakavand S.; Kakavand B.,2023,10.1080/10528008.2021.2021374,"In the era of big data, many business organizations consider data analytics skills as important criteria in the acquisition of qualified applicants. As numerous managerial decisions in the field of marketing are becoming evidence-based, business schools have integrated case studies about different stages of data analytics such as problem identification, data collection, data processing, data analysis and data visualization in order to improve the knowledge of marketing students. Although case studies can provide a good theoretical foundation about data analytics in the field of marketing, but they may not be sufficient for building analytical skills from a technical perspective. This paper provides a guideline on how Python as a programming language can be used to explore large datasets and improve marketing students’ capabilities with a focus on data processing, data analysis and data visualization tasks. In this research, a survey was conducted to measure the teaching effectiveness and overall satisfaction of marketing students (n = 84) in a Canadian university.

Monetizing the iot revolution,Donner H.; Steep M.,2021,10.3390/su13042195,"Academics and businesses alike tend to fail at understanding how the IoT revolution is monetized. We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial-and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection. © 2021 by the authors.

Lifestyles in Amazon: Evidence from online reviews enhanced recommender system,Huang Y.; Liu H.; Li W.; Wang Z.; Hu X.; Wang W.,2020,10.1177/1470785319844146,"Online lifestyles have been shown to reflect and affect consumers’ preferences across a wide range of online scenarios. In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference. The strong empirical evidence indicates that the big e-commerce consumer data facilitates more specialized market psychographic segmentation, which advances data-driven marketing decision-making. © The Author(s) 2019.",Amazon; big data-driven marketing; consumer preference prediction; lifestyles segmentation; personality; recommender system; text mining,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-big data
A review on big data based on deep neural network approaches,Rithani M.; Kumar R.P.; Doss S.,2023,10.1007/s10462-023-10512-5,"Big data analytics has become a significant trend for many businesses as a result of the daily acquisition of enormous volumes of data. This information has been gathered because it may be important for dealing with complicated problems including fraud, marketing, healthcare, and cyber security. Analytics are used by big businesses like Facebook and Google to analyse and make decisions about their massive volumes of collected data. Such analyses and decisions impact both the present and the future of technology. The inherent non-linear properties in huge data may be captured by deep learning (DL) algorithms using automated feature extraction techniques. In order to estimate renewable energy, energy consumption, demand, and supply, among other things, over the short, medium, and long term, a complete and in-depth investigation of generative, hybrid, and discriminative DL models is being conducted. This article examines the benefits and drawbacks of DL that depends on a variety of deep neural networks, including recurrent neural networks, multilayer neural networks, auto encoders and long short-term memory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Big data analytics; Recurrent neural networks; Sequence data,Springer Nature,scopus-big data

Data-driven marketing for growth and profitability,Grandhi B.; Patwa N.; Saleem K.,2021,10.1108/EMJB-09-2018-0054,"Purpose: In the current business environment, more uncertain than ever before, understanding consumer behavior is an integral part of an organization's strategic planning and execution process. It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in data driven-marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the “right” customers, to “keep” and “grow” them and to sustain “growth” and “profitability”. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses, 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included retail, BFSI, healthcare and government, automobile, telecommunication, transport and logistics and IT. Other industries represented were aviation, marketing research and consulting, hospitality, advertising and media and human resource. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for DDM. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders and Leaders based on their “current level of investments” and “willingness to enhance investments” soon. Research limitations/implications: With storming digital age and the development of analytics, the process of decision-making has gained significant importance. Judgment and intuition too are critical to the process. Choosing an appropriate action cannot be done strictly on a rational basis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of DDM. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; however, attitudes and social factors are equally important. Originality/value: There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Customer centric; Data-driven marketing; Digital data; Digital marketing and marketing investment; Marketing analytics; Marketing dashboard; Marketing metrics; ROMI (return on marketing investment) and diffusion of innovation; Value proposition,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-big data
From mining to meaning: How B2B marketers can leverage text to inform strategy,Tsao H.-Y.; Campbell C.; Sands S.; Mavrommatis A.,2022,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.08.007,"Today's marketers are increasingly faced with the need to collect and interpret data to aid firm strategic decision making. At the same time, there has been an explosion of text-based data and numerous advances in big data that enable marketers to mine the collection and aggregation of text. However, for many marketers there is a need to better understand how textual data can go beyond mere descriptive metrics to instead help solve real marketing problems. With this paper, we take a step in this direction. We first review key concepts and terms that are relevant to understanding how text analysis operates, as well as a new development in custom dictionary creation that expands the topics possible with text analysis. Next, we develop the FTTA grid, a new framework that enables text-derived metrics to inform actionable strategies for marketers. We present two real cases demonstrating how the FTTA grid can be employed in action.

IS DATA A SOURCE OF COMPETITION OR CONCERN IN THE BRAZILIAN RETAIL MARKET?; [Dados são uma fonte de competição ou preocupação no mercado varejista brasileiro?],Macedo B.G.; Leite A.O.M.; Oliveira P.H.,2024,10.52896/rdc.v12i1.1085,"Context: businesses have always used data to make decisions, but the amount, variety, and speed of data have increased dramatically in recent years. This fact led to the emergence of big data, which in turn intensified innovation, led to new services and products such as real-time traffic information and personalized marketing and delivery services. While big data has led to efficiency gains, it has also sparked a new debate in antitrust: to what extent, if any, could data become a competitive concern? Objective: this article is a case study on the Brazilian retail market based on recent literature on barriers to entry fostered by data-based activities and the importance of data as an asset capable of creating market power and giving rise to anti-competitive practices. Method: a bibliographical review was carried out regarding the importance of data as a possible asset that creates barriers to entry, as well as the interpretation of the Brazilian antitrust authority – Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade), in recent mergers, in addition to an exploratory analysis of data on access and revenue of the main retail players in different market segments and business types. Conclusions: the article concludes that, taking into account the case study, it is not evident that big data leads to highly competitive advantages in the retail sector in Brazil and that competitive concerns do not extend to all data-intensive markets, as data can be segmented and provide different competitive advantages that do not imply relevant barriers to the Brazilian retail sector. © 2024, Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE).

Influence of big data adoption on sustainable marketing and operation of SMEs: a hybrid approach of SEM-ANN,Baig M.I.; Yadegaridehkordi E.; Nizam Bin Md Nasir M.H.,2023,10.1108/MD-06-2022-0778,"Purpose: This research aimed to analyze and prioritize the factors affecting sustainable marketing (SM) and sustainable operation (SO) of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs through big data adoption (BDA). Design/methodology/approach: The technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical base and data were gathered from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN). Findings: The findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS. Practical implications: The findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development. Originality/value: The manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations. However, the associations between BDA and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs have been less explored. To address this issue, this study developed a theoretical model and examined the influence of BDA on SM and SO of manufacturing SMEs.

Creating and validating predictive personas for target marketing,Hsu P.-F.; Lu Y.-H.; Chen S.-C.; Kuo P.P.-Y.,2024,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2023.103147,"A persona is a widely used tool in the design field to help understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. Quantitatively creating personas is gaining importance for its greater representability, objectivity, and fast creative speed. However, quantitative personas built using traditional statistical methods may not reflect the marketing goals of decision-makers, and they mainly focus on categorizing existing users rather than predicting target customers. To address the research gap, this study proposes a guideline to create a predictive persona by using data-mining algorithms resulting in personas that can be validated. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and credibility of personas to effectively predict new customers for target marketing. We demonstrate a step-by-step guideline for creating the proposed predictive persona using real user data, validating its credibility, and comparing its predictive power against traditional quantitative personas. We thoroughly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative personas, traditional quantitative personas, and predictive personas while portraying suitable scenarios in which each type of persona is appropriate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Data-mining; Persona; Predictive persona; Qualitative persona; Quantitative persona; Target marketing,Academic Press,scopus-big data

Eye tracking technology to audit google analytics: Analysing digital consumer shopping journey in fashion m-retail,Tupikovskaja-Omovie Z.; Tyler D.,2021,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102294,"Rapid changes in digital consumer behaviour, influenced by exponential adoption of smartphones, require timely and sophisticated responses from retailers to these consumer needs. With a growing amount of big data available, fashion retailers need to innovate and develop more sophisticated analytics for new consumer behaviours such as m-commerce. This research has considered how Google Analytics data can be applied to develop customer journey maps to understand digital consumer behaviour. A multi-method research design was used, incorporating an innovative mobile eye tracking technology and mobile fashion consumer data from Google Analytics. Digital customers’ shopping journeys on the fashion retailer's website were mapped using data sourced from eye tracking and Google Analytics, gathered in parallel. The comparison of these shopping journeys allowed a critical evaluation of the precision and usefulness of the Google Analytics database. Google Analytics tracked only half of the digital users’ activities, whereas eye tracking data documented digital consumers’ interaction with all elements of the fashion retailer's website. The conclusion reached is that eye tracking can be used to audit the Google Analytics database for potential gaps in data and also to inform and improve marketing decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Consumer shopping journey; Digital consumer; Eye tracking; Fashion m-retail; Fashion retail; Google analytics; Marketing analytics,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
The Magnitude Heuristic: Larger Differences Increase Perceived Causality,Daniels D.P.; Kupor D.,2023,10.1093/jcr/ucac035,"With the rise of machine learning and ""big data,""many large yet spurious relationships between variables are discovered, leveraged by marketing communications, and publicized in the media. Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to many large-magnitude relationships between variables that do not signal causal effects. This exposure may carry a substantial cost. Seven studies demonstrate that the magnitudes of relationships between variables can distort consumers' judgments about whether those relationships reflect causal effects. Specifically, consumers often use a magnitude heuristic: consumers infer that relationships with larger perceived magnitudes are more likely to reflect causal effects, even when this is not true (and even when relationships' correlations are held constant). In many situations, relying on the magnitude heuristic will distort causality judgments, such as when large-magnitude relationships between variables are spurious, or when normatively extraneous factors (e.g., reference points) distort perceptions of magnitudes. Moreover, magnitude-distorted (mis)perceptions of causality, in turn, distort consumers' purchase and consumption decisions. Since consumers often encounter spurious relationships with large magnitudes in the health domain and in other consequential domains, the magnitude heuristic is likely to lead to biases in some of consumers' most important decisions.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Data-Driven Precision and Selectiveness in Political Campaign Fundraising,Walker D.; Nowlin E.L.,2021,10.1080/15377857.2018.1457590,"The sophistication of political campaigns has dramatically increased over recent election cycles through the embracing of big data analytics. Collecting and storing information on actual and potential voters, volunteers, and donors has produced extensive databases that are then used to guide microtargeting efforts related to advertising, organizing, and fundraising efforts. But building, maintaining, and analyzing this data are costly in itself. This paper looks at two aspects of data-driven political fundraising: precision and selectiveness, with respect to the alignment of the ideology of potential donors and the ideology of the candidate. Specifically, the proposed model is used to determine the optimal precision in estimating a donor’s location on the political ideology spectrum and the optimal targeting decision for fundraising solicitations given that estimate. Analysis of the model produces guidance for changes in solicitation cost and donation size. The results produced by the model are considered in light of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The analysis suggests that the Clinton campaign’s larger donation size likely played a greater role than did the campaign’s higher solicitation cost in terms of targeting. The model is also consistent with the Clinton campaign’s higher expenditures on analytics, given their larger donation size and solicitation cost. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Analytics; big data; data-driven marketing; direct marketing; fundraising; microtargeting; political campaigning,Routledge,scopus-big data
Strengthening green competitive advantage through organizational learning and green marketing capabilities in a big data environment: a moderated-mediation model,Zameer H.; Wang Y.; Yasmeen H.,2024,10.1108/BPMJ-09-2023-0691,"Purpose: Big data capabilities have the potential to completely transform conventional methods of doing business. Nevertheless, the role of big data capabilities in fostering green marketing capabilities and improving green competitive advantage is still not fully understood. To add new knowledge, this paper aims to propose a moderated mediation model to strengthen green competitive advantage in a big data environment. The model introduces both the mediating role of green marketing capabilities and the moderating role of big data capabilities. We developed and empirically tested a moderated mediation model. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we have adopted a survey-based methodology. The study collected data from 337 managers and empirically analyzed it to test the theoretical model of moderated mediation. We employed structural equation modeling for empirical analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that organizational learning improves green marketing capabilities, whereas the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage is insignificant. The mediating role of green marketing capabilities in the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage was statistically significant, indicating that green marketing capabilities serve as a bridge between organizational learning and green competitive advantage. Big data capabilities moderate the relationship between organizational learning and green marketing capabilities. The moderated mediation was also significant, highlighting that big data capabilities further strengthen the indirect effects of organizational learning on green competitive advantage via green marketing capabilities. Originality/value: This paper delivers theoretical and practical understandings of the importance of organizational learning and big data capabilities. Similarly, it extends current knowledge and provides key insights for managerial decision-making. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data; Green competitive advantage; Green marketing capabilities; Organizational learning,Emerald Publishing,scopus-big data

Real-time big data processing for instantaneous marketing decisions: A problematization approach,Jabbar A.; Akhtar P.; Dani S.,2020,10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.09.001,"The collection of big data from different sources such as the internet of things, social media and search engines has created significant opportunities for business-to-business (B2B) industrial marketing organizations to take an analytical view in developing programmatic marketing approaches for online display advertising. Cleansing, processing and analyzing of such large datasets create challenges for marketing organizations — particularly for real-time decision making and comparative implications. Importantly, there is limited research for such interplays. By utilizing a problematization approach, this paper contributes through the exploration of links between big data, programmatic marketing and real-time processing and relevant decision making for B2B industrial marketing organizations that depend on big data-driven marketing or big data-savvy managers. This exploration subsequently encompasses appropriate big data sources and effective batch and real-time processing linked with structured and unstructured datasets that influence relative processing techniques. Consequently, along with directions for future research, the paper develops interdisciplinary dialogues that overlay computer-engineering frameworks such as Apache Storm and Hadoop within B2B marketing viewpoints and their implications for contemporary marketing practices. © 2019",Batch processing; Big data; Decision making; Internet of things; Problematization; Programmatic marketing; Real-time processing; Social media,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-big data
Beyond supply chain management: jointly optimising operations/ supply and the marketing mix,Wacker J.G.; Samson D.,2021,10.1007/s12063-021-00218-8,"With the increasing use and availability of computing power and raised consumer power comes the need in competitive markets to produce and offer products and services that provide as precisely as possible the exact features of offerings that match customer requirements, with as little waste as possible. Further, customers have different thresholds of willingness to pay for sets of features. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and model the merging of supply chain strategies with the marketing decisions, which is key to the overall optimization of aspects of a firm’s strategy, including design of its products and their features, pricing, and positioning. The method used was to create the comprehensive modeling approach that represents these challenges not based on products, but based on individual features of those products, atomistically. The theoretical contribution made is the integration of supply chain optimization approaches, that are essentially based on the resource based view of the firm and focus on cost, with the marketing orientation approach to product design, pricing and marketing strategies. Further, this theoretical contribution recognises in its models that mass customization provides for individualization of features offered to each customer, at prices that reflect their assessed willingness to pay. There are many practical implications: many firms are moving towards full customization of feature sets, and increasingly pricing in a customized manner, and this trend will continue in practice as big data applications in markets go further and become more cost efficient. The integration of the marketing view and the resource-based operations view allows for a fully integrated view of competitive strategy and the design of products and services, so that firms can profit optimize their offerings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Business strategy; Marketing management; Micro-strategy; Modeling business strategies; Operations management; Operations marketing integration; Optimisation; Product features; Recource based view; Strategic integration; Supply chain management,Springer,scopus-big data

What people talk about online and what they intend to do: related perspectives from text mining and path analysis,Chang S.-Y.; Bodolica V.; Hsu H.-H.; Lu H.-P.,2023,10.1007/s40821-022-00221-4,"Nowadays, it remains unclear whether the accumulation of Internet buzz can accurately predict customer preferences and buying intentions. We study two related perspectives with regard to what people talk about online and what they intend to do in the adoption phase to offer advice to companies aiming to excel in online marketing efforts. Drawing on the consumption value theory, we examine buyers’ discussions about and intention to use wearable devices for a sample of consumers in Taiwan. A framework is advanced to explore the results of big data analysis employing text-mining techniques (i.e., what people talk about) and survey-based research using structural equation modelling (i.e., what people intend to do). Functional, emotional and conditional values surfaced as the highest Internet buzzes of wearable devices. Conversely, emotional, epistemic and functional values emerged as the most influential drivers of customers’ adoption intention. Our findings suggest that different value dimensions are relevant at different points of the purchase-related decision-making process. Some values animate Internet discussions that pertain to the pre-purchase information search stage, and others appear significant during the formation of people’s purchase intentions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and provide suggestions for future research. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Eurasia Business and Economics Society.",Big data; Consumption value theory; Electronic word-of-mouth; Online consumer behavior; Text mining; Wearable devices,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-big data
Clustering Social Media Data for Marketing Strategies,Chebil M.; Jallouli R.; Tobji M.A.B.,2024,10.18080/jtde.v12n1.889,"With the rise of social media platforms for marketing purposes, the central dilemma for researchers and policymakers lies in choosing effective data analysis tools to improve marketing decisions. In the academic literature, numerous articles have discussed clustering techniques for analysing social media data, from a perspective of data mining or social media marketing. However, few studies have attempted to synthesise results obtained from both perspectives. This research aims to (1) offer a structured overview of existing literature on clustering methods for marketing strategies and (2) compare three topic modelling techniques applied to extract the main topics evoked in the corpus of papers. Indeed, topic modelling emerges as a valuable tool for extracting relevant information from big data in general and more specifically from extensive scientific papers. Based on a thematic analysis, the extracted topics were classified according to the following categories: fields, marketing strategies and technologies. Results prove that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most effective technique in this context. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of clustering techniques and technologies used for marketing strategies in studied fields. These findings help researchers and practitioners to select the best techniques and technologies for extracting marketing knowledge from big data. © 2024 Telecommunications Association Inc..

Spreading expertise: think tanks as digital advocators in the social media era,Zhao J.; Zhu X.,2023,10.1093/polsoc/puad025,"Think tanks and their roles in rendering expertise in policy advice have been the subject of historical and ongoing research in policy sciences. However, the widening trend of digital behaviors of think tanks in the social media era is yet to be investigated. While social media is reshaping the political ecology and challenging conventional sources of knowledge, it also serves as a potential channel for think tanks to publicly share their expertise and policy advice with the public and decision-makers, thus evolving into “digital advocators.” Based on social media big data methods, this paper has constructed two sets of new think tank indicators with “network centrality” of social media accounts and “ripple effect” of social media citations from Facebook and Twitter to capture and observe the digital activities of 207 prominent think tanks in 62 countries or regions. We have concluded that think tanks have displayed their opinion and values and increased visibility as digital advocators by spreading expertise on social media platforms with online marketing skills. With various values and ideas, social media not only is hosting massive policy advocacy activities and being an expertise spreading arena for think tanks but has also been changing the ecology of the think tank industry and expertise markets. © The Author(s) 2023.

Dynamics of Musical Success: A Machine Learning Approach for Multimedia Data Fusion,Boughanmi K.; Ansari A.,2021,10.1177/00222437211016495,"The success of creative products depends on the felt experience of consumers. Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades. The authors then use the components of the model for marketing decisions such as forecasting the success of new albums, conducting album tuning and diagnostics, constructing playlists for different generations of music listeners, and providing contextual recommendations. © American Marketing Association 2021.",Bayesian nonparametrics; big data; data fusion; multimedia; music industry; product recommendations; supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-big data
Sentiment Analysis of User-Generated Content: A Bibliometric Analysis,Afriliana N.; Iswari N.M.S.; Suryasari,2022,10.33168/JSMS.2022.0634,"User-generated content offers the opinions and sentiment analysis of numerous individuals in diverse areas, including e-commerce, marketing, health care, transportation, customer service, brand research, and many others. However, the abundance of user-generated content data makes it challenging to analyze and derive insights from it. As a result, the demand for sentiment analysis research has increased. This work intends to highlight the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis through a bibliometric analysis. To our knowledge, bibliometric research of sentiment analysis on user-generated content has never been conducted. The research methodology adopted for this study was essentially divided into four phases. Those phases include data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis and report writing. This bibliometric research successfully identified the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis. This study will give a baseline for future researchers to start another study. Big data, text analytics, text mining, tourism, covid-19, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, making predictions, and marketing decisions are among the most recent research interests for sentiment analysis of user-generated content.

Reading between the lines: analyzing online reviews by using a multi-method Web-analytics approach,Gour A.; Aggarwal S.; Erdem M.,2021,10.1108/IJCHM-07-2020-0760,"Purpose: The dynamic yet volatile nature of tourism and travel industry in a competitive environment calls for enhanced marketing intelligence and analytics, especially for those entities with limited marketing budgets. The past decade has witnessed an increased use of user-generated content (UGC) analysis as a marketing tool to make better informed decisions. Likewise, textual data analysis of UGC has gained much attention among tourism and hospitality scholars. Nonetheless, most of the scholarly works have focused on the singular application of an existing method or technique rather than using a multi-method approach. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel Web analytics methodology to examine online reviews posted by tourists in real time and assist decision-makers tasked with marketing strategy and intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: For illustration, the case of tourism campaign in India was undertaken. A total of 305,298 reviews were collected, and after filtering, 276,154 reviews were qualified for analysis using a string of models. Descriptive charts, sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling and machine learning algorithms for real-time classification were applied. Findings: Using big data from TripAdvisor, a total of 145 tourist destinations were clustered based on tourists’ perceptions. Further exploration of each cluster through topic modeling was conducted, which revealed interesting insights into satisfiers and dissatisfiers of different clusters of destinations. The results supported the use of the proposed multi-method Web-analytics approach. Practical implications: The proposed machine learning model demonstrated that it could provide real-time information on the sentiments in each incoming review about a destination. This information might be useful for taking timely action for improvisation or controlling a service situation. Originality/value: In terms of Web-analytics and UGC, a comprehensive analytical model to perform an end-to-end understanding of tourist behavior patterns and offer the potential for real-time interpretation is rarely proposed. The current study not only proposes such a model but also offers empirical evidence for a successful application. It contributes to the literature by providing scholars interested in textual analytics a step-by-step guide to implement a multi-method approach. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",India; Text analytics; Tourism; User-generated content,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-big data
Decisions and Coordination of Green Supply Chain Considering Big Data Targeted Advertising,Hu H.; Li Y.; Li M.,2022,10.3390/jtaer17030053,"The application of big data targeted advertising in the green supply chain makes the green marketing of products more accurate and effective. This paper applies game theory to study the decisions and coordination issues of a green supply chain in which the online retailer conducts big data targeted advertising. A centralized model and two Stackelberg game models (an online-retailer-led decentralized model and a manufacturer-led decentralized model) were constructed and solved. The zero wholesale price-side-payment contract and greedy wholesale price-side-payment contract were introduced into the green supply chain for coordination. The study found that: (1) the increase in demand attenuation coefficient, green sensitivity coefficient, and big data targeted advertising sensitivity coefficient will be beneficial to the growth of total consumer demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit; (2) supply chain coordination is necessary because greenness, demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit under the centralized model are higher than those under two decentralized models; (3) two contracts can achieve the coordination of the green supply chain, and the profits of the manufacturer and online retailer under the contract are greater than those under the decentralized model. The results can provide insights for promoting green supply chain operations. © 2022 by the authors.",big data targeted advertising; coordination; green supply chain; greenness; online retailer; optimal decisions,MDPI,scopus-big data
The development of a public library data collection and analysis platform and its uses: a case study of the National Library Big Data Platform in Korea,Lee J.; Kwon N.,2023,10.22452/mjlis.vol28no2.5,"Public libraries reflect the contemporary way of life. In the era of the digital data age, actions carried out through libraries can be traced and analyzed to monitor the demand for library services. This study presents the development and utilization of Korea's National Library Big Data Platform (NLBDP), which was constructed to collect operational data from public libraries in the country and to build national open data platform for the participating libraries and for public use. This study analyzed 17 application cases that utilized NLBDP in order to understand the way the platform has been used. The findings showed that the types of data analyzed so far have been somewhat limited. It suggests needs for further enhancing the data quality and for diversifying data sources, such as individual local library operational data, surveys, demographics, news, and social media. The results also revealed that NLBDP has been utilized for seven distinct purposes: library operations and strategic planning; social trend analysis; collection management; redesigning library space; recruiting new patrons; library marketing; and non-library applications. Building an infrastructure for networked data analysis not only enables evidence-based decision-making in public libraries, but also extracts timely topics that can be developed as useful services for their community.

How to cooperate in a three-tier food delivery service supply chain,Ma S.; He Y.; Gu R.; Yeh C.-H.,2024,10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.103828,"This paper studies a three-tier food delivery service supply chain (FDSSC) composed of one restaurant that is responsible for providing food and catering services, one food delivery platform that is responsible for providing big data marketing, and one rider that is responsible for providing food delivery services. Then, differential game theory is used to model and derive the objective functions and equilibrium strategies of the FDSSC members in four scenarios: decentralization, independent delivery, independent production, and centralization. The effects of cooperation patterns among the FDSSC members, consumer channel preferences, commission rates, and food delivery fees of the food delivery platform on the optimal decision-making and performance of the FDSSC members are discussed. Through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis of essential parameters, we summarize the following conclusions. First, whether it is independent production and independent delivery, any cooperation between the FDSSC members is always beneficial for the profit improvement of all FDSSC members. Therefore, the restaurant, food delivery platform, and rider should actively seek pairwise or tripartite cooperation to achieve common profit enhancement. In addition, when the online channel preference of consumers increases, the restaurant should continuously enhance the food quality and catering service level to ensure an amazing dining experience for consumers, which is conducive to the formation of a healthy dual-channel food sales model. Last, a higher commission rate can increase the profits of the food delivery platform and the whole FDSSC, but it damages the revenue of the restaurant, while a higher food delivery fee can bring more profits to the restaurant and rider. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Big data marketing; Food delivery platform; Food delivery service; Food supply chain; Pricing,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data

For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10–20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape. A traffic light dashboard for domestic and inbound air travel demand to Spain shows how destination managers might use Big Data relating to the early recovery of key source markets to develop targeted marketing strategies. We show how Big Data provides timely granular data essential in highly volatile situations, and we argue that destination management organisations must improve their Big Data analytical and evidence-based, decision-making skills. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big Data; COVID-19; forecast; impact; risk; tourism,Routledge,scopus-big data
Building Social Capital for a Proactive Environmental Strategy: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,Zhuang Y.; Ye L.,2022,10.1109/EMR.2022.3141995,"Environmental issues are becoming critical drivers of firm's competitive advantages. In response, many firms are adopting proactive environmental strategies. A proactive environmental strategy requires a substantial investment of resources from firms, and social capital provides the necessary resources for firms to adopt a proactive environmental strategy. In this article, we explore how social capital contributes to proactive environmental strategy from different perspectives, including marketing, human resources, operations, supply chain, and big data analytics, with the focus on how this issue affects managerial decision-making.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.",Multidisciplinary perspective; proactive environmental strategy; social capital,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,scopus-big data
Content-Based Model of Web Search Behavior: An Application to TV Show Search,Liu J.; Toubia O.; Hill S.,2021,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3827,"We develop a flexible content-based search model that links the content preferences of search engine users to query search volume and click-through rates, while allowing content preferences to vary systematically based on the context of a search. Content preferences are defined over latent topics that describe the content of search queries and search result descriptions. Compared with existing applications of topic modeling in marketing and recommendation systems, our proposed approach can simultaneously capture multiple types of information and investigate multiple aspects of behavioral dynamics in a single framework that enables interpretable results for business decision making. To facilitate efficient and scalable inference, we develop a full Bayesian variational inference algorithm. We evaluate our modeling framework using real-world search data for TV shows from the Bing search engine. We illustrate how our model can quantify the content preferences associated with each query and how these preferences vary systematically based on whether the query is observed before, during, or after a TV show is aired. We also show that our model can help the search engine improve its ranking of search results as well as address the cold-start problem for new page links.

A Rental Platform Service Supply Chain Network Equilibrium Model Considering Digital Detection Technology Investment and Big Data Marketing,Peng Y.; Li H.,2023,10.3390/su15139955,"Digital transformation is reshaping the decision making management of the rental service mode in the manufacturing industry, and improving digital detection technology and big data marketing have become effective ways to create value. Based on the three-level rental platform service supply chain network structure composed of manufacturers, rental platform operators and the demand market, a supply chain network equilibrium model considering the digital detection technology input and big data marketing is constructed by using variational inequality and the Nash equilibrium theory, and the optimal decision making conditions of the manufacturers and rental platform operators are derived. Combined with the Euler algorithm design procedure and numerical examples, the influences of the digital detection technology level, big data marketing cost coefficient and cost sharing ratio on the equilibrium state are analyzed. The results show that the input of digital detection technology leads to the increase in profits of each participant in the rental platform service supply chain network and promotes a more coordinated development of the supply chain. When the rental platforms implement big data marketing, the manufacturers share the cost, which can continuously improve the profits of both partners and make the cooperation more stable and efficient. © 2023 by the authors.",big data marketing; digital detection technology investment; network equilibrium; rental platform service supply chain,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-big data
An Instrumental Variable Forest Approach for Detecting Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Observational Studies,Wang G.; Li J.; Hopp W.J.,2022,10.1287/mnsc.2021.4084,"This study addresses the ubiquitous challenge of using big observational data to identify heterogeneous treatment effects. This problem arises in precision medicine, targeted marketing, personalized education, and many other environments. Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects presents several analytical challenges including high dimensionality and endogeneity issues. We develop a new instrumental variable tree (IVT) approach that incorporates the instrumental variable method into a causal tree (CT) to correct for potential endogeneity biases that may exist in observational data. Our IVT approach partitions subjects into subgroups with similar treatment effects within subgroups and different treatment effects across subgroups. The estimated treatment effects are asymptotically consistent under a set of mild assumptions. Using simulated data, we show our approach has a better coverage rate and smaller mean-squared error than the conventional CT approach. We also demonstrate that an instrumental variable forest (IVF) constructed using IVTs has better accuracy and stratification than a generalized random forest. Finally, by applying the IVF approach to an empirical assessment of laparoscopic colectomy, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity to make accurate comparisons of the heterogeneous effects of the treatment (teaching hospitals) and control (nonteaching hospitals) on different types of patients.

Platform Operations in the Industry 4.0 Era: Recent Advances and the 3As Framework,Siqin T.; Choi T.-M.; Chung S.-H.; Wen X.,2024,10.1109/TEM.2021.3138745,"In the Industry 4.0 era, implementing advanced technologies to enhance platform operations is crucial. Motivated by the importance of platforms and the wide implementation of Industry 4.0-related advanced technologies, we conduct this study on platform operations. Specifically, the platforms discussed herein are classified into (pure) product selling platforms and service platforms. We identify the platform-related operational issues in four categories: 1) the use of information, 2) operating/manufacturing processes, 3) decision support, and 4) consumer behavior and marketing. Based on the examined real-world practices and reviewed prior studies, we propose the novel '3As' framework to indicate how platforms should 'adopt' advanced technologies to 'address' operational issues to 'achieve' outcomes. In addition, the '3As' framework uncovers possible platform innovations with three extended developments. Finally, we present a future agenda for further studies on the use of advanced technologies in platform operations.

Combining sell-out data with shopper behaviour data for category performance measurement: The role of category conversion power,Pascucci F.; Nardi L.; Marinelli L.; Paolanti M.; Frontoni E.; Gregori G.L.,2022,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102880,"Retailers need to manage a series of complex decisions relating to numerous products. To reduce this complexity, they have introduced category management practices, which consider groups of similar products (categories) that can be managed separately as single business units (SBUs). Although the concept that the store offer should be organised as a category mix and that this strategy allows for better overall store management is already consolidated, retailers still struggle to adopt an approach to the store performance measurement starting from a category level perspective. Nowadays, the available methods for measuring categories’ performance are quite limited. The current trend sees the measurement of category performance mainly based on sell-out data that are ill-equipped to fully address category management issues. Retailers should broaden their field of analysis not only by focusing on the product/sales perspective but also by including other methodologies such as shopper behaviour analysis. In this regard, the use of technology offers the retail sector new perspectives for those analysis. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the retail analytics topic by presenting a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring. More in detail, we could derive a new key performance indicator, category conversion power (CCP), aimed at analysing and comparing the single categories organised within the store. The research is based on a unique dataset obtained from a real-time locating system (RTLS), which allowed us to collect behavioural data togheter with sell-out data (from POS scanner). We argue that retailers could exploit this new analytical method to gain more understanding at the category level and therefore make data-driven decisions aimed at improving performance at the store level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Category management; Performance measurement; Retail marketing; RTLS technology; Shopper behaviour,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
Rethinking the role of uncertainty and risk in Marketing,Grimaldi D.; Sallan J.M.; Arboleda H.; Sehgal S.,2023,10.1080/12460125.2023.2232570,"Big Data Analytics (BDA) solutions are increasingly applied in marketing, with the aim of transforming data available online to market information and competitive intelligence. When businesses encounter risky situations (calculated risks) complex models using BDA are often the go-to solution. However, there is a still a debate if BDA is the best solution in uncertain situations when unexpected phenomena arise. The present study begins to fill this gap using the Colombian context as evidence and a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fs-QCA). The focus shifts from a single cause leading to performance to an analysis of different associations of conditions. There are three major findings-first, in a risky environment, BDA is not a unique condition; a combination of data maturity levels, data skills and a data-driven mindset and culture are necessary to obtain good business performance. Second, even in the era of Big Data, large companies still use simple rules (heuristics) to make decisions which improve their performance. Finally, the environmental state (uncertain, certain, risky) is a moderating factor in the choice between BDA or Heuristics. The results indicate marketing managers should use a multi-model approach incorporating both BDA and heuristics. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big Data Analytics; Heuristic; Marketing; Risk; Uncertainty,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-big data
Design requirements of a modern business Master’s degree course: perspectives of industry practitioners,Miah S.J.; Solomonides I.,2021,10.1007/s10639-020-10285-2,"Contemporary industry practices must be appropriately reflected in designing modern-day teaching and learning programmes. Existing studies are limited to systematic methodologies for accumulating contemporary practice requirements and using that data to inform the design of educational programmes, even though various, local approaches for doing so often exist in higher education institutions.

The Green Consumption Behavior Process Mechanism of New Energy Vehicles Driven by Big Data—From a Metacognitive Perspective,Chen J.; Liu Q.,2023,10.3390/su15108391,"Green consumption behavior is the embodiment of pro-environmental behavior, which is of great value to curb carbon emissions. However, the existing research on the model construction and quantitative analysis of the psychological process of green consumption behavior needs to be further explored. Therefore, on the basis of green consumption behavior and metacognitive theory, this study constructs a conceptual model of a psychological process with a psychological control source, green consumption attitude, three aspects of metacognition, and green consumption behavior and puts forward the hypothesis of an action mechanism. This study combines text mining technology and expert knowledge to establish a user review mining dictionary and mines the variables in the quantitative conceptual model through word embedding to test empirically the mechanism hypothesis. The results show that psychological control source has a significant impact on green consumption behavior, and green consumption attitude plays a partial mediating role between them. Metacognitive knowledge plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption behavior; metacognitive experience plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption attitude. Metacognitive monitoring plays a moderating role between green consumption attitude and green consumption behavior. In view of the above research results, we put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions: For organizations, it is necessary to identify green consumption groups, attach importance to green consumption experience, perform well in green marketing, and improve the competitiveness of green products; for decision makers, it is necessary to control strictly the industry standards of the green product market and perform well not only in the quality supervision of green products but also in the post-market construction of green products. © 2023 by the authors.",green consumption behavior; metacognitive theory; psychological control source; text mining technology,MDPI,scopus-big data

The study aims to develop a marketing data analytics framework to manage online reviews, especially fake reviews, which have become a significant issue undermining the creditability of online review systems. As small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the capabilities to automatically derive customer insights from online reviews, this study proposes a cost-effective, extensible Review-Analytics-as-a-Service (RAaaS) framework that can be operated by non-data specialists to facilitate online review data analytics. We demonstrate the framework’s application by using two datasets with more than 400,000 online reviews from Yelp to simulate live platforms and demonstrate an analytic flow of review fraud detection and understanding. The findings reveal insights into the influence of fake reviews on product ranking and exposure rate. Moreover, it was found that there was a higher concentration of sadness and anger in fake reviews (vs. organic reviews). In addition, fake reviews tend to be shorter, more extreme (with the use of strong adverbs), and have different patterns of topic distribution.

A Brisbane, Australia, case study",Brown C.; Christensen S.; Blake A.; Indraswari K.; Wilson C.; Desouza K.,2023,10.1108/JPPEL-08-2022-0029,"Purpose: Information on the impact of flooding is fundamental to mitigating flood risk in residential property. This paper aims to provide insight into the seller disclosure of flood risk and buyer behaviour in the absence of mandated seller disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a case study approach to critically evaluate the matrix of flood information available for buyers purchasing residential property in Brisbane, Queensland. This paper uses big data analytic techniques to extract and analyse internet data from online seller agents and buyer platforms to gain an understanding of buyer awareness and consideration of flood risk in the residential property market. Findings: Analysis of property marketing data demonstrates that seller agents voluntarily disclose flood impact only in periods where a flooding event is anticipated and is limited to asserting a property is free of flood risk. Analysis of buyer commentary demonstrates that buyers are either unaware of flood information or are discounting the risk of flood in favour of other property and locational attributes when selecting residential property. Practical implications: This research suggests that improved and accessible government-provided flood mapping tools are not enhancing buyers’ understanding and awareness of flood risk. Accordingly, it is recommended that mandatory disclosure be introduced in Queensland so that buyers are more able to manage risk and investment decisions before the purchase of residential property. Originality/value: This paper contributes to existing literature on raising community awareness and understanding of natural disaster risks and makes a further contribution in identifying mandatory disclosure as a mechanism to highlight the risk of flooding and inform residential property purchasers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Community resilience; Consumer behaviour; Disaster management; Flood risk; Natural hazard,Emerald Publishing,scopus-big data

EXPLICATION OF THE ROLE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN MARKETING MANAGEMENT OF A MODERN COMPANY,Dunayev I.; Hromov S.; Tymchenko Y.; Proskurina M.,2022,10.15587/1729-4061.2022.265017,"This study considers the use of digitalization technologies in the management of marketing of a commercial company. As a result, the problem of bringing empirical knowledge about the importance of digitalization technologies in the company’s marketing management to a theoretical model has been solved. Digitalization technologies for implementation in marketing activities were selected and the decomposition of marketing management in a commercial company was performed. On this basis, a theoretical model for assessing the impact of digitalization technologies on the marketing management of a commercial company has been developed. The results of an empirical study based on the developed theoretical model proved the truth of the hypothesis about the positive impact of the spread of the use of digitalization technologies on the marketing management components of commercial companies. The choice of specific digitalization technologies is explained by the essence of marketing as a management activity. Structural decomposition of the marketing management process is explained by traditional management functions and clarifies the criteria for choosing technologies. The results of calculations according to the formed theoretical model are explained by the development of the platform economy and ecosystems, which involve the studied big data technologies, cloud computing and social media, as well as blockchain. The methodical approach to substantiating the role of digitalization technologies proposed in this study is characterized by the use of fundamental provisions on cybernetic systems, management theory, and modern marketing concepts. The obtained results make it possible to find out the presence and direction of the effects of the spread of the use of digitalization technologies in the company’s marketing management and make informed decisions about the business digitalization strategy © 2022, Authors.

Machine learning based customer meta-combination brand equity analysis for marketing behavior evaluation,Xu Z.; Zhu G.; Metawa N.; Zhou Q.,2022,10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102800,"At present, the focus of marketing research is mostly on the influencing factors, composition, and measurement of brand equity. The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components. It was a detailed study of the current state of brand marketing strategies and customer satisfaction, found key indicators of brands that could improve customer satisfaction, and presented corresponding suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies. It shows that. It has the importance of good guidance and references to improve customer satisfaction in the industry. © 2021",Big Data; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Factor Analysis; Machine learning; Meta-combined approach,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
Seize the Opportunity of Targeted Marketing under the Platform Membership Mechanism,Hu L.; Sun X.; Yu H.; Chung S.H.,2024,10.1109/TEM.2022.3169392,"Under the pressure of surging advertising costs and fierce market competition, a growing number of online merchants are trying to implement new advertising strategies to improve advertising efficiency and increase sales. In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,scopus-big data
Shopping Hard or Hardly Shopping: Revealing Consumer Segments Using Clickstream Data,Zavali M.; Lacka E.; De Smedt J.,2023,10.1109/TEM.2021.3070069,"The recent rise of big data analytics is transforming the apparel retailing industry. E-retailers, for example, effectively use large volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business operations data to aid operations and supply chain management. Although logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions, leaving it an under-researched area of study. Adding to this research stream by exploring the case of a U.K.-based fast-fashion retailer, this article reveals unique consumer segments and links them to the revenue they are capable of generating. Applying the partitioning around medoids algorithm to three random samples of 10 000 unique consumer visits to the e-commerce site of a fast-fashion retailer, six consumer segments are identified. This article shows that although the 'mobile window shoppers' segment consists of the largest consumer segment, it attracts the lowest revenue. In contrast, 'visitors with a purpose,' although one of the smallest segments, generates the highest revenue. The findings of this article contribute to marketing research and inform practice, which can use these insights to target customer segments in a more tailored fashion.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Apparel retailing; big data; clickstream data; consumer segmentation; online purchase,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,scopus-big data
The role of absorptive capacity and big data analytics in strategic purchasing and supply chain management decisions,Patrucco A.S.; Marzi G.; Trabucchi D.,2023,10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102814,"Big data analytics (BDA) is widely used in sales, marketing, distribution, and finance; however, its implementation in supply chain management, specifically in purchasing and supply management (PSM), has been slow and uneven. This study investigates the impact of BDA on strategic PSM decisions and how it interacts with a company's absorptive capacity. We conducted a survey of 222 purchasing and supply chain managers in international companies across various industries. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the exploration, assimilation, and transformation capabilities of purchasing departments are crucial in facilitating the use of BDA for strategic decision-making in PSM. Companies that excel in BDA in the PSM space are better equipped to capitalize on new and existing knowledge sources, which improves their performance. However, only businesses with the right resources can fully leverage BDA for high-level strategic decision-making; when BDA is applied to operational PSM activities, the desired effects may not be achieved. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Absorptive capacity; Big data analytics; Knowledge management; Purchasing management; Supply chain management,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
Bridging the marketing-finance divide: use of customer voice in managerial decision-making,Saxena D.; Brady M.; Lamest M.; Fellenz M.,2022,10.1108/QMR-09-2020-0113,"Purpose: This study aims to provide more insight into how customer voice is captured and used in managerial decision-making at the marketing-finance interface. This study’s focus is on understanding how the customer voice, often communicated through online and social media platforms, is used in high-performing hotels. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a case study of four high-performing Irish hotels. For each case, multiple informants, including marketing managers, general managers and finance managers, were interviewed and shadowed. Twenty seven decisions across the four cases were analysed to assess the use of customer voice in managerial decision-making. Findings: Social media provides a stage that has empowered the customer voice because of the public nature of the interaction and the network effect. Customer voice is incorporated in managerial decision-making in three distinct ways – symbolically as part of an early warning system, for action-oriented operational decisions and to some extent in the knowledge-enhancing role for tactical decisions. While there is a greater appreciation among senior managers and the finance and accounting managers of the importance of customer voice, this study finds clear limits in its utilisation and more reliance on traditional finance and accounting data, especially in strategic decision-making. Research limitations/implications: The cases belong to a highly visible open environment of hotels in an industry where customer voice has immediate and strong effects. The findings may not directly apply to industries characterised by a relatively more closed context such as banking or insurance. Moreover, the findings reflect the practices of high-performing hotels and do not necessarily capture the practices used in less successfully operating hotels. Practical implications: While marketers need to enhance their ability to create a narrative that links the customer voice to revenue generation, finance managers also need to develop a skillset and adopt a mindset that appropriately reflects the influential role for customer voice in managerial decision-making. Originality/value: Despite the linkage of marketing performance to business performance, there is limited research on the impact of customer information on managerial decision-making. This research provides insight into how customer voice is considered at the critical marketing-finance interface. © 2022, Deepak Saxena, Mairead Brady, Markus Lamest and Martin Fellenz.",Big data; Customer voice; Managerial decision-making; Marketing-finance interface; Service decisions; Social media,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-big data
A pricing optimization modelling for assisted decision making in telecommunication product-service bundling,Zakaria A.F.; Lim S.C.J.; Aamir M.,2024,10.1016/j.jjimei.2024.100212,"Product service bundle (PSB) is a marketing strategy that offers attractive product-service packages with competitive pricing to ensure sustained profitability. However, designing suitable pricing for PSB is a non-trivial task that involves complex decision-making. This paper explores the significance of pricing optimization in the telecommunication industry, focusing on product-service bundling (PSB). It delves into the challenges associated with pricing PSB and highlights the transformative impact of big data analytics on decision-making for PSB strategies. The study presents a data-driven pricing optimization model tailored for designing appropriate pricing structures for product-service bundles within the telecommunication services domain. This model integrates customer preference knowledge and involves intricate decision-making processes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the paper conducts a case study encompassing two design scenarios, wherein the results reveal that the model offers competitive pricing compared to existing telecommunication service providers, facilitating PSB design and decision-making. The findings from the case study indicate that the data-driven pricing optimization model can significantly aid PSB design and decision-making, leading to competitive pricing strategies that open avenues for new market exploration and ensure business sustainability. By considering both product and service features concurrently, the proposed model provides a pricing reference for optimal decision-making. The case study validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach within the telecommunication industry and highlights its potential for broader applications. The model's capability to generate competitive pricing strategies offers opportunities for new market exploration, ensuring business growth and adaptability. © 2024 The Author(s)",Bundle pricing; Pricing decision; Product service bundle; PSB; Service design,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-big data
"The impact of the decision-making role on perceived satisfaction, value for money, and reinvest intentions at varying levels of perceived financial performance in the context of Big Data Marketing Analytics",Haverila K.; Haverila M.; Rangarajan A.,2024,10.1080/10696679.2024.2305445,"Business resources and processes such as Big Data Marketing Analytics (BDMA) are becoming increasingly focused on meeting the needs and objectives of customers. Consequently, this research aims to use PLS-SEM to explain the interaction and relationships between the core user-centric performance measures of BDMA, such as user satisfaction, value for money and reinvestment intention. Also, the significance of the decision-making role was explored in this context. Finally, the impact of perceived financial performance was investigated to see its impact on the examined relationships. The impact of value for money on user satisfaction, the impact of the decision-making role on user satisfaction, and finally, the impact of the decision-making role on the reinvestment intentions were found to be significant for individuals who scored either low or high perceived financial performance. Furthermore, all the observed relationships in the dataset were positive, whereas only three were positive and significant for individuals who scored low on perceived financial performance. Overall, it is clear that perceived financial performance has a vital role in BDMA deployment, where understanding the influence of user authority in decision-making enables managers to design better organizational plans by integrating inputs from multiple organizational cross-layers. Also, the results indicate that a user’s decision-making role influences user-centric measures in BDMA deployment, which reveals how user perceptions and authority play a vital role in the context of BDMA in firms. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Routledge,scopus-big data
USING BIG DATA TO MODEL TIME-VARYING EFFECTS FOR MARKETING RESOURCE (RE)ALLOCATION,Saboo A.R.; Kumar V.; Park I.,2016,10.25300/MISQ/2016/40.4.06,"Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance. © 2016 University of Minnesota.

Mobile targeting in industrial marketing: Connecting with the right businesses,Feng X.; Li Y.; Lin X.; Ning Y.,2020,10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.06.007,"Although the existing literature has acknowledged the importance of mobile marketing, few scholars have examined the efficacy of mobile targeting. This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile targeting by investigating the effects of customer mobile habits and social capital on firm sales. Leveraging unique customer mobile browsing data from a major telecom service provider in China, we use a Bayesian SEM (structural equation modeling) approach to show that customer mobile habits and social capital exert significant influences on customers' purchase intentions. Specifically, customers who engage in more hedonic mobile behaviors, such as social networking, video browsing, and gaming are associated with a higher probability of purchasing, controlling for the usage of communications apps including messaging and emailing apps, and the usage of functional apps, such as maps, living services, and app market apps. Additionally, our research results reveal a significant positive effect of social capital on firms' sales performance. These findings offer important insights that are often missing from organizational targeting campaign designs in terms of targeting both the right customers and the right business alliance partners and enable a better understanding of managerial and decision-making implications in the context of the B2B market in general. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Bayesian SEM; Big data; Hedonic value; Mobile habits; Mobile targeting; Social capital,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-big data
A dynamic capability view of marketing analytics: Evidence from UK firms,Cao G.; Duan Y.; El Banna A.,2019,10.1016/j.indmarman.2018.08.002,"While marketing analytics plays an important role in generating insights from big data to improve marketing decision-making and firm competitiveness, few academic studies have investigated the mechanisms through which it can be used to achieve sustained competitive advantage. To close this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capability view to posit that a firm can attain sustained competitive advantage from its sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities, which are manifested by the use of marketing analytics, marketing decision-making, and product development management. This study also examines the impact of the antecedents of marketing analytics use on marketing related processes. The analysis of a survey of 221 UK firm managers demonstrates: (a) the positive impact of marketing analytics use on both marketing decision-making and product development management; (b) the effect of the latter two on sustained competitive advantage; (c) the indirect effect of data availability on both marketing decision-making and production development management; and (d) the indirect effect of managerial support on marketing decision-making.

Analysing customer behaviour in mobile app usage,Chen Q.; Zhang M.; Zhao X.,2017,10.1108/IMDS-04-2016-0141,"Purpose - Big data produced by mobile apps contains valuable knowledge about customers and markets and have been viewed as productive resources. The purpose of this paper is to propose a multiple methods approach to elicit intelligence and value from big data by analysing the customer behaviour in mobile app usage. Design/methodology/approach - The big data analytical approach is developed using three data mining techniques: RFM(recency, frequency, monetary) analysis, link analysis, and association rule learning. The authors then conduct a case study to apply this approach to analyse the transaction data extracted from a mobile app. Findings - This approach can identify high value and mass customers, and understand their patterns and preferences in using the functions of the mobile app. Such knowledge enables the developer to capture the behaviour of large pools of customers and to improve products and services by mixing and matching the functions and offering personalised promotions and marketing information. Originality/value - The approach used in this study balances complexity with usability, thus facilitating corporate use of big data in making product improvement and customisation decisions. The approach allows developers to gain insights into customer behaviour and function usage preferences by analysing big data. The identified associations between functions can also help developers improve existing, and design new, products and services to satisfy customers' unfulfilled requirements. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data; Customer behaviour; Mobile app,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-big data
A hierarchical framework for ad inventory allocation in programmatic advertising markets,Li J.; Ni X.; Yuan Y.; Wang F.-Y.,2018,10.1016/j.elerap.2018.09.001,"Enabled by the big data driven user profiling and precision bidding techniques, online programmatic advertising markets have evolved from the traditional website-buying or ad-slot-buying models to a fine-grained and real-time trading model at the level of ad impressions (i.e., ad inventory). As a result, Web publishers are now facing a challenging decision of allocating the ad inventory across multiple advertising models, which has a direct and important influence on both their individual revenues, and the market-wide supply-demand balance. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF), taking into consideration the possible scenarios of ad inventory allocation in programmatic advertising markets. AIAF explicitly captures the specific features of ad inventory allocation in each of three levels (i.e., channel level, market level and platform level), and also their influence-feedback effects. We present the general solution process for solving this model on the basis of its property analysis. An illustrative instantiation of our AIAF model is formulated to demonstrate its applications in supporting publishers’ decision-making on the ad inventory allocation. We also conduct experiments based on empirical data so as to validate the model and analysis. Our research findings indicate that 1) our AIAF model outperforms other single-level and two-level allocation strategies; 2) the fine-grained optimization is superior to that of the coarse-grained level; 3) allocation decisions should be made on the basis of the comparative marginal revenue instead of the absolute marginal revenue. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Ad inventory; Header bidding; Private marketplace; Programmatic advertising; Real-time bidding,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-big data
Social media as a strategic tool: Going beyond the obvious,Arora P.; Predmore C.E.,2013,10.1108/S1877-6361(2013)0000011010,"Purpose - This chapter demonstrates the strategic use of social media by firms interacting with stakeholders, not just customers. Corporations have seen how consumers can share their experiences with products and services. Smart companies find ways to leverage these conversations to engage current and potential customers and other stakeholders. Design/methodological approach - Our approach is theoretical, based on an examination of how the communication channel of social media can be used as a strategic tool throughout the organization, going well beyond marketing. Findings - This chapter looks at four advantages of social media. Social media provides a mechanism for firms to not just find customers, but also allow customers to find firms. Social media can engage customers, industry influencers, and thought pundits in cost-effective ways that benefit both the firm and stakeholders. The largest contribution of social media is the information from big data on customer needs and wants as well as on the processes underlying consumer decisions. The greatest opportunity lies in how a firm converts data into actionable intelligence in real time. Practical applications - We discuss how the words, social and media, need to be de-coupled: The concept of social can be practically applied very effectively to areas of strategy and internal learning, and product development. Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by social media requires a social enterprise to be effective. Originality - This chapter presents an original theoretical framework of social media that can be used by a company to examine the social aspects and implications of every element in the value chain.

Dynamic cooperation strategies of the closed-loop supply chain involving the internet service platform,Xiang Z.; Xu M.,2019,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.310,"In the age of “Internet+” many Internet service platforms (ISPs) in China have been widely introduced to the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To further study the role of the Internet service platform, this paper considers a CLSC composed of a manufacturer, a retailer and an Internet service platform who invests in research and development (R&D), advertising and Big Data marketing, and develops the goodwill dynamic model based on the differential game theory. The construction of a goodwill dynamic model has two purposes, namely, to increase sales and the return rate. The optimal decisions for 3 players under two different cooperative scenarios are obtained, namely, the retailer payment scenario (scenario D) and the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario (scenario S). The supply chain members gain more profit or achieve a higher level of goodwill for products under certain conditions, i.e., a high residual value from remanufacturing, a high sharing rate of residual value from the retailer's recycled products, and a low recycling cost. Interestingly, the wholesale price increases with the residual value of recycled products when goodwill effectiveness is low, while the price declines when goodwill effectiveness is high. After comparing two cooperative scenarios, the result shows that an Internet service platform will invest more in Big Data marketing under the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario, and cooperation between the manufacturer and the Internet service platform can help improve the goodwill of enterprises or products. Moreover, the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario is payoff-Pareto-improving in most cases through the coordination of a cost-sharing rate, and the effectiveness of Big Data marketing exerts a positive effect on goodwill and the development of the industry. In addition, the retailer has “free rider” tendencies in the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario. The results encourage more enterprises to enhance the value of goodwill through cooperation with Internet service platforms because Internet service platforms conveniently utilize Big Data marketing to increase the sales of products and the collecting rate of used products, which in turn helps environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Big data marketing; Closed-loop supply chain; Differential game; Internet service platform,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data

From academic research to marketing practice: Exploring the marketing science value chain,Roberts J.H.; Kayande U.; Stremersch S.,2014,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2013.07.006,"We aim to investigate the impact of marketing science articles and tools on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools, which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term ""marketing science value chain"" to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain.In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual - academic and practice - impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers.

These findings point to exciting opportunities for future research, including increased attention on enabling promises made to tourists and development of strategic and research principles; increased use of experimental, quasi-experimental and longitudinal research designs, as well as unstructured qualitative designs; and an increased focus on the study of actual behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Big data; Marketing knowledge; Promise management; Tourism marketing; Tourism marketing knowledge grid,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
When ‘significant’ is not significant,Kennedy R.; Scriven J.; Nenycz-Thiel M.,2014,10.2501/ijmr-2014-041,"Big data is here for some and coming for many. It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies. We offer insights for market research practitioners and marketers alike, to ensure they are getting the best from their data for robust marketing decision-making. © Warc 2014 Warc Ltd.",,Market Research Society,scopus-big data
Big data-driven framework for viral churn prevention: A case study,Lucantoni L.; Antomarioni S.; Bevilacqua M.; Ciarapica F.E.,2020,10.24425/mper.2020.134930,"The application of churn prevention represents an important step for mobile communication companies aiming at increasing customer loyalty. In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk. A case study of a mobile communication company is also presented to explain the proposed procedure, as well as to analyze its real performance and results. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

"BBC Arabic, Social Media and Citizen Production: An Experiment in Digital Democracy before the Arab Spring",Gillespie M.,2013,10.1177/0263276413482382,"This article examines an innovative experiment in democratizing international broadcasting through embracing a participatory model of production. In spring 2010, a political debate television series was co-created by BBC Arabic and citizen producers, using social media tools. Based around interviews with prominent political and controversial public figures, the programme (G710) was broadcast weekly on satellite TV across the Middle East and the Arabic-speaking world. Combining collaborative ethnography with corporate ‘big data’ analysis, the research team followed the experiment from conception to premature closure. The article argues that the kinds of digital tools deployed in producing the programme, and used by BBC audience research to monitor user practices in real time, have become essential to corporate processes of BBC World Service governance and management procedures, business strategy, accountability measures, marketing practices and editorial decision-making. They act as change agents, presenting methodological problems and opportunities for the BBC's audience researchers and academic researchers, as well as symbolizing the contradictory logic of empowerment and surveillance. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

Abuse of Dominance in Non-Negotiable Privacy Policy in the Digital Market,Wahyuningtyas S.Y.,2017,10.1007/s40804-017-0084-0,"Personal data and its use have become the front-line of businesses in the digital market. With the potential to be extracted for information, making this available for various purposes, big data transforms into a powerful tool for data controllers for effective marketing, defining strategic business decisions, and establishing a strong foothold in the market. The use of personal data for targeted marketing exemplifies this. While privacy has been subject to the regime of privacy protection, privacy violation might entangle competition law analysis when it involves abuse of market dominance. This paper addresses these problems by discussing three key issues: first, how competition law addresses the use of personal data as the new frontier of innovation and competition; second, whether big data plays a role to qualify dominance; and third, if non-negotiable policy on privacy infringes the prohibition of dominance abuse under competition law. © 2017, T.M.C.

Managing marketing decision-making with sentiment analysis: An evaluation of the main product features using text data mining,Kauffmann E.; Peral J.; Gil D.; Ferrández A.; Sellers R.; Mora H.,2019,10.3390/su11154235,"Companies have realized the importance of ""big data"" in creating a sustainable competitive advantage, and user-generated content (UGC) represents one of big data's most important sources. From blogs to social media and online reviews, consumers generate a huge amount of brand-related information that has a decisive potential business value for marketing purposes. Particularly, we focus on online reviews that could have an influence on brand image and positioning. Within this context, and using the usual quantitative star score ratings, a recent stream of research has employed sentiment analysis (SA) tools to examine the textual content of reviews and categorize buyer opinions. Although many SA tools split comments into negative or positive, a review can contain phrases with different polarities because the user can have different sentiments about each feature of the product. Finding the polarity of each feature can be interesting for product managers and brand management. In this paper, we present a general framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, text data mining, and clustering techniques, to obtain new scores based on consumer sentiments for different product features. The main contribution of our proposal is the combination of price and the aforementioned scores to define a new global score for the product, which allows us to obtain a ranking according to product features. Furthermore, the products can be classified according to their positive, neutral, or negative features (visualized on dashboards), helping consumers with their sustainable purchasing behavior. We proved the validity of our approach in a case study using big data extracted from Amazon online reviews (specifically cell phones), obtaining satisfactory and promising results. After the experimentation, we could conclude that our work is able to improve recommender systems by using positive, neutral, and negative customer opinions and by classifying customers based on their comments. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Feature selection; Marketing decisions; Sentiment analysis,MDPI,scopus-big data

S1 was described by D. Kahneman as a spontaneous and automatic reaction by an unconscious way in which human decision-makers choose among multiple alternatives. Application of S1 can be seen as a simplified BWS for data eliciting and express analysis of prioritization between many compared items. In S1, a respondent picks the items with which she feels “happy”, and those can be one, several, all, or none items in a task. Estimation of utilities is performed by multinomial-logit modeling with different optimization criteria which produce parameters of the models and choice probabilities of the items. Numerical examples by marketing research data are encouraging and demonstrating that spontaneous choice decisions can make S1 approach very fast, efficient, and convenient for express analysis of items prioritization, especially for big data. © 2019, © 2019 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",BWS; choice probability; max diff; MNL utility; prioritization; System 1,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-big data

In this context, business analytics offer the opportunity to harness the knowledge and value hidden within enterprise information systems to revolutionize innovation, enhance supply chain management and production, accurately target marketing and sales efforts, as well as develop and manage profitable after-sales services. While the literature to date presents numerous specific applications in which business analytics techniques were successfully deployed to improve specific business units, it is evident that a comprehensive enterprise approach is missing. In the present work, a pathway to attain market leadership through the effective use of business analytics is defined suggesting focus must center on three increasingly challenging barriers. Firstly, “standardization” of collection, aggregation and storage of data must be accomplished. Then, an “organizational culture evolution” that outgrows intuition and embraces data-driven decision-making is needed to create the perfect ecosystem for business analytics to produce actionable results and recommendations. In turn, these must guide “business model innovation” efforts to tackle new value creation, and capture and secure market leadership. © 2019",Big data; Business analytics; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
Application of Customer Segmentation for Electronic Toll Collection: A Case Study,Qian C.; Yang M.; Li P.; Li S.,2018,10.1155/2018/3635107,"Applying big data technology, this study presents a customer segmentation method of Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) based on vehicle behavioral characteristics. A segmentation index system of ETC customers comprising Recency, Frequency, and Monetary is extracted and constructed using ETC data. The whole-sample clustering analysis of ETC customers is accomplished with the Clustering LARge Applications (CLARA) algorithm while overcoming the invalidation problem of big data clustering. A decision tree on ETC customer segmentation is constructed and transformed into a set of segmentation rules. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is better able to analyze travel characteristics and to present values and appreciation potentials for ETC customer classification. This method provides an innovative idea for implementing precision marketing and establishing hierarchical discount rates for ETC customers.

Geospatial analytics for federally managed tourism destinations and their demand markets,Supak S.; Brothers G.; Bohnenstiehl D.; Devine H.,2015,10.1016/j.jdmm.2015.05.002,"Understanding geospatial demand for destinations can improve management decisions affecting destination planning, marketing, natural preservation, and resident as well as visitor experiences. Visualization and analysis of demand markets are significantly enhanced by the capabilities of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and help to support management objectives. This study implements traditional desktop GIS as well as a free, web-delivered decision-support tool for tourism planning and marketing to assess ~7.5 million overnight accommodation reservations made for federal recreational facilities between 1999 and 2007. Visitor origin frequency and median travel distance for overnight accommodations are summarized by visitor zip code and by facility. National results indicate: (1) facilities in the west, the Great Lakes and the southern Appalachians regions draw overnight visitors from the greatest median distances; (2) residents in the Northeast have the lowest per-capita utilization; (3) residents within the south-central Midwest and central-west Southern States have the highest percapita utilization and tend strongly toward local overnight reservations. Three selected national park regions are used to illustrate destinations characterized by highly localized utilization (Hot Springs National Park, AR), both local and regional utilization (Yosemite National Park, CA) and regionally to nationally dispersed utilization with few local residents reserving overnight accommodations (Canyonlands National Park, UT).

Management overconfidence and CSR activities in Korea with a big data approach,Kang S.-A.; Cho S.-M.,2020,10.3390/su12114406,"We examined the relationship between management characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) and this relationship was differentiated by the level of corporate governance. Our analysis was undertaken in firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE) from 2006 to 2015. We employed Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression after clustering the standard errors at the firm level in order to examine these relationships. The KEJI (Korea Economic Justice Institute) index was used as a proxy for CSR and a big data-based proxy estimated from multimedia was used as the level of advertising. We showed that there is a positive relationship between overconfident management and CSR activities. We then categorized the CSR activities as primary and social activities and found that overconfident management is more aggressive in primary CSR activities. In addition, overconfident management makes fewer CSR expenditures when the management is in a chaebol firm but promotes more CSR advertisement. This finding indicates that chaebol affiliation controls overinvestment in CSR activities but promotes CSR advertisements by overconfident managers. Similarly, we found consistent results with overconfident ownermanagers. Prior literature on CSR activities focuses on the impact of CSR activities on firm performance. In this paper, we elucidated the determinants of CSR activities, so that this research contributes to firms' decision-making about sustainable management. Our estimation of CSR variables with big data approaches will also guide future research on this issue. We expect our study to be used as a reference for decision-making by relevant authorities and stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.",Big data; CEO; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Overconfidence,MDPI,scopus-big data

These log data can be utilized for the purpose of web marketing. The customers who purchase many product items are good customers, whereas the other customers, who do not purchase many items, must not be good customers even if they browse many items. If the attributes of good customers and those of other customers are clarified, such information is valuable as input for making a new marketing strategy. Regarding the product items, the characteristics of good items that are bought by many users are valuable information. It is necessary to construct a method to efficiently analyze such characteristics. This paper proposes a new latent class model to analyze both purchasing and browsing histories to make latent item and user clusters.

The value of field experiments,Li J.Q.; Rusmevichientong P.; Simester D.; Tsitsiklis J.N.; Zoumpoulis S.I.,2015,10.1287/mnsc.2014.2066,"The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: The number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy.

The research on the relationship between senior executives outside of that with the CEO is limited; this paper fills that gap by exploring CMO/CIO cooperation. To analyze the dynamics of the CMO/CIO relationship, this research introduces a conceptual framework that captures three antecedents of cooperation: interdependence, CMO/CIO relationship structure, and CMO/CIO diversity. In cases in which dependence between the two executives is asymmetric, this paper proposes four cooperation mechanisms expected to mediate the relationship between these individual and organizational level antecedents and CMO/CIO cooperation. When the two executives cooperate, it leads to strategically aligned decision-making that increases business performance by integrating technology, data, and the customer into strategic decision-making. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",big data; chief information officer; Chief marketing officer; cooperation; interdependence,Routledge,scopus-big data
An impulse to exploit: the behavioral turn in data-driven marketing,Nadler A.; McGuigan L.,2018,10.1080/15295036.2017.1387279,"Industry advocates argue that by tailoring services and commercial solicitations to match media users’ personal interests, data-driven marketing benefits both consumers and businesses. This article shows, however, that advertisers and marketers who are taking up ideas and techniques from behavioral economics tell their clients a very different story about the aims and use of digital marketing and consumer surveillance. Listening in on this discourse demonstrates that some digital marketers conceptualize their own practices as forms of social control, appropriating concepts from behavioral economics to identify consumers’ cognitive and affective biases and target their vulnerabilities. Behavioral economics recognizes that economic decisions are not simply dictated by rational self-interest; rather, such choices depend on cognitive heuristics and habits, and can be manipulated through the design of “choice architecture.” This article discusses implications of the behavioral turn in data-driven marketing for critical advertising scholars, public advocates, and regulators. © 2017 National Communication Association.",Behavioral economics; big data; consumer surveillance; digital marketing; political economy,Routledge,scopus-big data
Towards a real-time processing framework based on improved distributed recurrent neural network variants with fastText for social big data analytics,Ait Hammou B.; Ait Lahcen A.; Mouline S.,2020,10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102122,"Big data generated by social media stands for a valuable source of information, which offers an excellent opportunity to mine valuable insights. Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is able to increase the classification accuracy of several existing works based on RNN models for sentiment analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; BiLSTM; FastText; GRU; LSTM; Natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Social big data analytics,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
Forecasting client retention — A machine-learning approach,Schaeffer S.E.; Rodriguez Sanchez S.V.,2020,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.101918,"In the age of big data, companies store practically all data on any client transaction. Making use of this data is commonly done with machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost. This knowledge permits a company to focus marketing efforts on such clients as early as three months in advance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Client retention; Machine learning; Prepaid unitary services; Sales forecasting,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data
THE DATA HIERARCHY: factors influencing the adoption and implementation of data-driven decision making,Sleep S.; Hulland J.; Gooner R.A.,2019,10.1007/s13162-019-00146-8,"Marketing practitioners have access to a rapidly increasing quantity and variety of data from customers and other stakeholders. Managers use the term “Big Data” to describe this avalanche of information, which many view as critical to providing a better understanding of customers and markets. This research uses interviews with managers to examine the marketing function’s perspective on data-driven decision making within the firm. Based on informant responses, we develop a hierarchy of data-oriented decision making, describe the drivers that influence where a firm falls within this hierarchy, and detail several transition capabilities for marketing managers interested in becoming more data-driven. The key factors that influence the level of data driven decision making are: 1) firm environment; 2), competition, 3) executive commitment, 4) interdepartmental dynamics, and 5) organizational structure. This framework guides marketing managers both in evaluating the firm’s data capabilities and facilitating change. © 2019, Academy of Marketing Science.",Big data; Big data hierarchy; Data-driven decision making; Grounded theory,Springer,scopus-big data

Leveraging trends in online searches for product features in market response modeling,Du R.Y.; Hu Y.; Damangir S.,2015,10.1509/jm.12.0459,"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",Big data; Conjoint analysis; Google trends; Market response model; Product feature,American Marketing Association,scopus-big data

Big data in the Mexico City brand in the context of audience fragmentation; [Big data en la marca Ciudad de México ante la fragmentación de audiencias],Sánchez L.G.C.; Calderón C.I.G.; Contreras T.C.; León A.A.R.,2020,10.14198/INTURI2020.20.06,"The article analyzes economic behavior throughout the world in response to the media effort of tourist destinations in dispersed markets. The Internet has influenced communication and boosted new technologies, which have advanced dramatically in the first three decades of the twenty-first century. This has had an impact on the various economic activities, among which tourism is particularly salient. Consequently, consumers no longer have a receptive role. They have become decision makers with respect to the media material that they consume in addition to having the opportunity of being information providers. Mexico City (CDMX), as a tourism segment, is no exception. It depends on the communication of public and private actors, who, while having certain methodologies and tools to access their audiences, interact with an audience that decides on what it receives and gives its opinion on the web. Therefore, the objective of the research is to assess the associated concepts, pages and organizations related to tourism in CDMX on the website aimed at both a domestic and international audience, designed by the government and private sector together with the input of the audience as an information provider. Likewise, the study seeks to determine the countries with the greatest interest in Mexico City as a tourist destination, since this can be highly important for directing the marketing strategies. The methodology used to explore the phenomenon takes a documentary and quantitative form, since in a first stage it includes the documentary analysis and subsequently makes the mathematical exploration through the use of network analysis (ARS) to assess the role of Big data and Smart Data in the CDMX brand before the fragmentation of audiences. © 2020 Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Turisticas.

Segmenting consumers based on willingness to share data for marketing purposes,Block M.P.; Schultz D.E.,2020,,"Despite new privacy rules and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data and Protection Regulation and the pending California Consumer Protection Act, not all consumers feel the need for data protection. Recent research has shown that 20-25 per cent of the US adult population are willing to share their personal data with marketers they ‘trust’. The marketing challenge thus becomes how to identify these willing ‘data sharers’. Using a widely available data set, this study illustrates several ‘Big Data-based’ segmentation methodologies to screen this important segment out of the general population, ranging from factor analysis to chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) decision trees. The results of these analyses identify some unexpected potential segments among these ‘data sharer’ groups, most notably young men who participate in team sports. Thus, the paper argues that rather than looking at privacy regulation as a burden, marketers might well consider it a key element in their toolbox. © 2020, Henry Stewart Publications.

Bridging customer knowledge to innovative product development: a data mining approach,Zhan Y.; Tan K.H.; Huo B.,2019,10.1080/00207543.2019.1566662,"In the big data era, firms are inundated with customer data, which are valuable in improving services, developing new products, and identifying new markets. However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",customer knowledge management; data mining; fast-cycle industry; product development,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-big data

Actors in different enterprises worked feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital data will give objective insight into human relations and provide authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of communication and social shaping of database and data mining technologies in the institutional context of genome science to understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with biological, physical, and big data.

Exploring the optimal granularity for market segmentation in RTB advertising via computational experiment approach,Qin R.; Yuan Y.; Wang F.-Y.,2017,10.1016/j.elerap.2017.07.001,"Real Time Bidding (RTB) is a novel business model of online computational advertising, developing rapidly with the integration of Internet economy and big data analysis. It evolves the business logic of online ad-delivery from buying “ad-impressions” in websites or ad slots to directly buying the best-matched “target audiences”, and thus can help advertisers achieve the precision marketing. As a critical part of RTB advertising markets, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) play a central role in matching advertisers with their target audiences via cookie-based data analysis and market segmentation, and their segmentation strategies (especially the choice of granularity) have key influences in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RTB advertising markets. Based on a mathematical programming approach, this paper studied DSPs’ strategies for market segmentation, and established a selection model of the granularity for segmenting RTB advertising markets. With the computational experiment approach, we designed three experimental scenarios to validate our proposed model, and the experimental results show that: 1) market segmentation has the potential of improving the total revenue of all the advertisers; 2) with the increasing refinement of the market segmentation granularity, the total revenue has a tendency of a rise first and followed by a decline; 3) the optimal granularity of market segmentation will be significantly influenced by the number of advertisers on the DSP, but less influenced by the number of ad requests. Our findings show the crucial role of market segmentation on the RTB advertising effect, and indicate that the DSPs should adjust their market segmentation strategies according to their total number of advertisers. Our findings also highlight the importance of advertisers as well as the characteristics of the target audiences to DSPs’ market segmentation decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Computational experiment; Demand Side Platforms; Market segmentation; Real Time Bidding,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-big data

This study provides reliable constructs of utilization of social media marketing in order it can be useful information and materials of information decisions making for managers in hospitality industries. The sample in this study consists of 177 general managers and marketing managers in three to five star hotels in Jakarta based on data from the Jakarta Statistic Center in 2016 and the Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association (PHRI). Statistical test results show that the constructs of utilization of social media marketing includes means of retaining customers, customer improvement effectiveness, actively communicating with customers, intensively attracting customers, and proactively capturing customers. These results can implicitly direct and make the right decisions on the ways that service organizations can use social media as the main source of big data information. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.",Customer improvement effectiveness; Information based decision making; Intensive communication; Service business; Social media marketing,Allied Business Academies,scopus-big data
Interaction of the social media and big data in reaching marketing success in the era of the fourth industrial revolution,Pranjić G.; Rekettye G.,2019,10.1504/IJBPM.2019.102015,"The contemporary economic environment is characterised by the economic megatrends that are (re)shaping economic practice in the 21st century. The most important megatrend is the digitalisation, which triggers a whole new economic revolution, so called ‘fourth industrial revolution’. In the situation with the new data source, new technological means for harvesting and processing of data, digitalisation and fourth economic revolution is very relevant not only for the operation but the marketing function as well. Social media represent an excellent source of data and channel of communication with the customer. Marketing spending on digital media platform soon will be no. 1, and it will overtake TV as the dominant marketing channel. Introducing the big data analytical capabilities, adjustment of overall organisation scheme and hiring competent personnel, the company will be in a position to save money for marketing spending, but in same time overall marketing performances will increase. Introducing big data analytical capabilities and efficient use of available social media platform is a challenging task that lay ahead of senior executives. Support from the highest management instances is the critical preconditions in reaching desired outcomes in the possible synergy between big data (BD) and social media marketing (SMM).

"Prediction, pre-emption and limits to dissent: Social media and big data uses for policing protests in the United Kingdom",Dencik L.; Hintz A.; Carey Z.,2018,10.1177/1461444817697722,"Social media and big data uses form part of a broader shift from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’ forms of governance in which state bodies engage in analysis to predict, pre-empt and respond in real time to a range of social problems. Drawing on research with British police, we contextualize these algorithmic processes within actual police practices, focusing on protest policing. Although aspects of algorithmic decision-making have become prominent in police practice, our research shows that they are embedded within a continuous human–computer negotiation that incorporates a rooted claim to ‘professional judgement’, an integrated intelligence context and a significant level of discretion. This context, we argue, transforms conceptions of threats. We focus particularly on three challenges: the inclusion of pre-existing biases and agendas, the prominence of marketing-driven software, and the interpretation of unpredictability. Such a contextualized analysis of data uses provides important insights for the shifting terrain of possibilities for dissent. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Big data; dissent; predictive policing; protest; social media,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-big data
Teaching social media analytics: An assessment based on natural disaster postings,Goh T.T.; Sun P.-C.,2015,,"Unstructured data in social media is as part of the ""big data"" spectrum. Unstructured data in Social media can provide useful insights into social phenomena and citizen opinions, both of which are critical to government policy and businesses decisions. Teachers of business intelligence and analytics commonly use quantitative data from sales, marketing, finance and manufacturing to demonstrate various analytics concepts in a business context. However, researchers have seldom used social media data to analyze social behavior and communication. In this study we aim to demonstrate an assessment structure for teaching social media analytics concepts with the goal of analyzing and interpreting social media content. We base this assessment on forum postings regarding two recent events: the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The aim of the assessment is to discover social insights. We base the assessment structure on Cooper's Analytics Framework to cover such concepts as term frequency (TF), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), data visualization, sentiments and opinions analysis, the Nearest Neighbor K-NN classification algorithm, and Information Diffusion theory. We review how the students performed on the assignment that used this assessment, and we make recommendations for future studies. © 2015 by the Education Special Interest Group (EDSIG) of the Association of Information Technology Professionals.",Data analytics; Social behavior; Social media; Text processing,Journal of Information Systems Education,scopus-big data

A multi-level text classifier for feedback analysis using tweets to enhance product performance,Balusamy B.; Murali T.; Thangavelu A.; Venkata Krishna P.,2015,10.1504/IJEMR.2015.073455,"Big Data refers to the collection and storage of the enormous amount of data which is heterogeneous in nature. Data analysis is quite complex due to its enormous volume and its high generation speed. Big Data has many business applications such as in promotion, marketing either financially or by supporting in decision making. One such application is the sentiment analysis that paves the way for the business analysts to know the positive or negative impact over the product based on the tweets by the people. We propose a three-level text classifier with the first level as principal components analysis (PCA) followed by the support vector machine (SVM) and the conditional random fields (CRF) as the second and third level using the tweets collected. This feedback analyser would promote the sales of the product due to its high accuracy in feedback classification.

A sentiment classification on Indian government schemes using pyspark,Sujatha E.; Radha R.,2020,,"With the rapid growth of social media, millions of users share their opinions everyday about different issues such as services, products, persons, politics, events etc. By analysing these social user’s opinions the most valuable data can be obtained which is used for decision making in various domains. Sentiment Analysis in social media plays a vital role in monitoring of public opinion behind certain topics. Actually 92% of marketing professionals thought that social media has intense effect on their business. By doing an accurate sentiment analysis, winning might not be an impossible thing. Success does not depend only in the number of likes, comments or followers. It also depends in how much positive discussions have been held among the users of social media. The objective of this paper is to build a model that performs multi-class classification of Big data with improved accuracy. The proposed model uses a hybrid of Lexicon-based approach and Machine Learning based approach. In this paper, we have performed the sentiment analysis on the three Central Government Schemes namely Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Make-in India. The Apache Spark’s Machine Learning library, MLlib has been used in order to achieve better results in sentiment analysis for the Big Data. The AFINN dictionary was used to label the tweets and bigrams feature set was used. The Hashing TF-IDF method was used to extract the feature vectors from the raw feature set. These vectors were classified by Random Forest classifier to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments of tweets. The result from this model was tested by using the various testing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-score. The higher accuracy of 89.27% was obtained. © 2020, Research Trend.

Big Data and consumer behavior: imminent opportunities,Hofacker C.F.; Malthouse E.C.; Sultan F.,2016,10.1108/JCM-04-2015-1399,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess how the study of consumer behavior can benefit from the presence of Big Data. Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers a conceptual overview of potential opportunities and changes to the study of consumer behavior that Big Data will likely bring. Findings – Big Data have the potential to further our understanding of each stage in the consumer decision-making process. While the field has traditionally moved forward using a priori theory followed by experimentation, it now seems that the nature of the feedback loop between theory and results may shift under the weight of Big Data. Research limitations/implications – A new data culture is now represented in marketing practice. The new group advocates inductive data mining and A/B testing rather than human intuition harnessed for deduction. The group brings with it interest in numerous secondary data sources. However, Big Data may be limited by poor quality, unrepresentativeness and volatility, among other problems. Practical implications – Managers who need to understand consumer behavior will need a workforce with different skill sets than in the past, such as Big Data consumer analytics.

The phenomenon of capturing and trying to use all of the semi-structured and unstructured data has been called by vendors and bloggers ‘Big Data’. Organisations can capture and store data of many types from almost any source, but capturing and storing data only adds value when it has a useful purpose. Big Data must be used to provide input to analytics and decision support capabilities if it is to create real value for organisations. Some bloggers, industry leaders and academics have become disillusioned by the term Big Data. It is a marketing term and not a technical term.

Electronic word of mouth analysis for new product positioning evaluation,Gregoriades A.; Pampaka M.,2020,10.1016/j.elerap.2020.100986,"People increasingly choose to express themselves online through electronic word of mouth (eWOM), generating large amounts of data, making eWOM a valuable source of information through big data analytics. This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers’ opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers’ preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers’ opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product. This work constitutes a methodological contribution with demonstrated implications for new product positioning strategy evaluation using tweet analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Micro-blogs; Product positioning; Sentiment Analysis; Topic modelling,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-big data
Applying big data to guide firms’ future industrial marketing strategies,Gnizy I.,2020,10.1108/JBIM-06-2019-0318,"Purpose: While big data (BD), a transformative emerging phenomenon on its youth, plays a growing role in organizations in improving marketing decision-making, few academic works examine the mechanism through which BD can be applied to guide future competitive advantage strategies. The purpose of this paper is to examine if BD’s predictive power helps business to business (B2B) firms selecting their intended generic (differentiation, focus, and cost leadership) strategies. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the learning theory, the study proposes the use of BD as a key driver of intended strategies. Based on data from a cross-industry sample of executives, a conceptual model is tested using path and robustness analyses. Findings: The use of BD plays a prominent role in the selection of intended future strategies in industrial markets. Additional tests demonstrate conditions of competitive intensity and strategic flexibility where BD is more and less beneficial. Research limitations/implications: The study furthers the understanding of traditional learning and intelligence use frameworks and of contemporary future strategies drivers. Practical implications: BD availability enables managers leveraging knowledge embedded in data-rich systems to gain predictive insights that help in guiding new strategic directions to maintain competitive advantage. Originality/value: The study reinforces the continued applicability of Porter’s generic positioning strategies in the digital era. It addresses the paucity of research on BD in B2B context and is the first to provide theoretical and practical reflections on how BD utilization influences industrial intended strategies. The study strengthens contemporary managerial views defending that data drive strategies rather than the opposite. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data; Cost leadership strategy; Differentiation strategy; Focus strategy; Future strategy,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-big data

From Exclusion to Connection: The Role of Anthropomorphic Chatbots in Shaping Customer Responses Post-Social Exclusion,Jia X.; Zhao X.; Tao W.; Ahn S.,2024,10.1080/15332861.2024.2375965,"In a world where digital interactions have become the norm, chatbots are evolving to not only assist with tasks but also to alleviate feelings of social exclusion. This study investigates how anthropomorphic chatbots influence customer engagement and emotional responses following social exclusion, and further impact their commercial decisions. Through a between-subject experiment involving 609 participants, we explored the effects of anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) chatbots across three social exclusion conditions (ignored, rejected, and control). Our findings reveal that anthropomorphic chatbots significantly enhance purchase intention, relational investment, and organizational trust, mediated by increased senses of belonging and control and enhanced parasocial interactions. This research enriches the marketing literature by applying the need-threat model and illuminating the psychological mechanisms underlying customer responses. The practical implications for marketing and public relations professionals include strategies for optimizing brand-consumer interactions through the strategic use of anthropomorphic chatbots. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",anthropomorphism; Chatbot; commercial decisions; need-threat model; social exclusion,Routledge,scopus-chatbot
Does a chatbot’s location influence consumer attitude and intentions?,Roozen I.; Raedts M.; Waetermans G.,2024,10.1504/IJIMA.2024.139294,"Chatbots engage in real-time conversations with customers. Moreover, they can collect data in a digital landscape that is increasingly sensitive to privacy. The objective of this study was to help strategic marketing decision-makers better understand how and where chatbots can be used effectively to gather consumer data. We analyse whether consumers’ privacy concerns influence their adoption. Furthermore, we invest if privacy concerns, and subsequently information disclosure, are significantly influenced by the chatbot’s location. In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer’s website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots. Both relationships are sequentially mediated via higher privacy concerns and less comfort with information disclosure. Companies therefore need to consider where to deploy their chatbots.

Trust and digital privacy: willingness to disclose personal information to banking chatbot services,Lappeman J.; Marlie S.; Johnson T.; Poggenpoel S.,2023,10.1057/s41264-022-00154-z,"This study explored digital privacy concerns in the use of chatbots as a digital banking service. Three dimensions of trust were tested in relation to user self-disclosure in order to better understand the consumer-chatbot experience in banking. The methodology selected for this research study followed a conclusive, pre-experimental, two-group one-shot case study research design which made use of a non-probability snowballing sampling technique. Privacy concerns were found to have a significantly negative relationship with user self-disclosure in both treatment groups. Respondents exposed to their preferred banking brand experienced lower user self-disclosure and brand trust than those exposed to a fictitious banking brand within the South African context. It is recommended that companies using chatbots focus on easing privacy concerns and build foundations of trust. The gains that chatbots have made in the form of increased productivity and quality of customer service rely on relationships with users who need to disclose personal information. Through this study, we concluded that, despite its power to influence decision-making, the power of a brand is not enough for consumers to considerably increase self-disclosure. Rather, a bridge of trust (through education, communication and product development) is needed that encompasses all three elements of trust, which are brand trust, cognitive trust and emotional trust. Limited research exists on the relationship between financial services marketing and chatbot adoption. Thus, this study addressed a theoretical gap, by adding brand trust to existing studies on cognitive and emotional trust regarding user self-disclosure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Chatbots; Conversational commerce; Digital privacy; Internet banking; Online brand trust; User self-disclosure,Palgrave Macmillan,scopus-chatbot
Employees' perceptions of chatbots in B2B marketing: Affordances vs. disaffordances,Lin X.; Shao B.; Wang X.,2022,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.11.016,"We investigate the impacts of chatbots' technical features on employees' perceptions (namely, chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots) in the context of B2B marketing. In particular, to capture the technical features of chatbots, we identify three types of chatbot affordances (i.e., automatability, personalization, and availability) and three types of chatbot disaffordances (i.e., limited understanding, lack of emotion, and null decision-making). We show that these types of chatbot affordances and disaffordances are related to chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots, which in turn can affect employees' attitudes toward chatbots. We conducted an empirical study via an online survey and collected data from 228 B2B marketing employees. While automatability and personalization enhance chatbot effectiveness, null decision-making increases discomfort with using chatbots. Further, chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots both influence employees' attitudes toward chatbots. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Affordance; B2B marketing; Chatbot; Disaffordance; Discomfort; Effectiveness,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-chatbot
Evaluation on Innovation of Emotional Marketing in Network Live Broadcasting Based on New Media Environment,Wang X.; Yin Z.; Omar N.A.B.,2023,10.33168/JSMS.2023.0328,"With the increase of per capita disposable income of residents and the improvement of social and economic development, people's demand for entertainment has surged, and the online live broadcasting industry has ushered in a golden age of vigorous development. Traditional webcast has the shortcomings of poor user experience, low interactivity and low content quality, which makes it difficult to meet the diversified and personalized consumption requirements of the audience. In this context, the live broadcast system based on social media platform has become one of the effective means to solve these problems. The new media online live emotional marketing has a strong transmissibility, which can provide consumers with more rich and interesting ways to obtain information, and can also improve the effect of brand promotion and word of mouth promotion. Based on the theory of multimodal learning, this paper analyzed the characteristics of user behavior among different types of social networking sites, and explored the emotional interaction mode on social networking sites from the visual and voice dimensions, and provided a basis for the formulation of emotional marketing strategies for webcasting and business decision-making. The article also compared the traditional live broadcast marketing mode with the online live broadcast emotional marketing under the new media environment. The results showed that the live broadcast marketing under the new media environment has a better effect, and the sales volume has also increased by 3.87%. It can effectively control costs and audience satisfaction is also higher.

A video-based automated recommender (VAR) system for garments,Lu S.; Xiao L.; Ding M.,2016,10.1287/mksc.2016.0984,"In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers. © 2016 INFORMS.",Collaborative filtering; Retailing; Video analysis,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-computer vision
Life Insurance Prediction and Its Sustainability Using Machine Learning Approach,Shamsuddin S.N.; Ismail N.; Nur-Firyal R.,2023,10.3390/su151310737,"Owning life insurance coverage that is not enough to pay for the expenses is called underinsurance, and it has been found to have a significant influence on the sustainability and financial health of families. However, insurance companies need to have a good profile of potential policyholders. Customer profiling has become one of the essential marketing strategies for any sustainable business, such as the insurance market, to identify potential life insurance purchasers. One well-known method of carrying out customer profiling and segmenting is machine learning. Hence, this study aims to provide a helpful framework for predicting potential life insurance policyholders using a data mining approach with different sampling methods and to lead to a transition to sustainable life insurance industry development. Various samplings, such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, Randomly Under-Sampling, and ensemble (bagging and boosting) techniques, are proposed to handle the imbalanced dataset. The result reveals that the decision tree is the best performer according to ROC and, according to balanced accuracy, F1 score, and GM comparison, Naïve Bayes seems to be the best performer. It is also found that ensemble models do not guarantee high performance in this imbalanced dataset. However, the ensembled and sampling method plays a significant role in overcoming the imbalanced problem. © 2023 by the authors.",ensemble; imbalanced data; life insurance; machine learning; sampling,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-data mining

In this article, the customers of ISACO are first classified using clustering techniques and use multilayer neural network to calculate the monetary value of each group of customers during a specific period of time. Then, the Markov chain approach is used to develop a model for calculating the lifetime value of ISACO's customers considering the possibility of changes in their behavior in different periods.

New approach to customer segmentation based on changes in customer value,Hosseini M.; Shabani M.,2015,10.1057/jma.2015.10,"In today’s fast moving world of marketing from product-orientation to customer-orientation, the management of customer treatment can be seen as a key to achieve revenue growth and profitability. Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance. Most customer segmentation approaches based on customer value fail to account for the factor of time and the trend of value changes in their analysis. In this article, we classify customers based on their value using the RFM model and K-means clustering method. Then, an assessment of changes over several periods of time is carried out.

Design and Implementation of an Efficient Electronic Bank Management Information System Based Data Warehouse and Data Mining Processing,Luo J.; Xu J.; Aldosari O.; Althubiti S.A.; Deebani W.,2022,10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103086,"The quantity of electronic bank data grows exponentially with development of Information Technology (IT). The size of these data is impossible for traditional database and human analyst to come up with interesting information that will help in process of decision making. Management Information System (MIS) based Data warehouse (DW) and Data Mining (DM) techniques support the development of IT and process of management decision-making. But the traditional DW size make the query complex, which may cause unacceptable delay in decision support queries. Thus, in this paper an Efficient Electronic Bank MIS based DW and Mining Processing (EEBMIS-DWMP) was developed with cluster and non-cluster indexed view to provide decision-makers with both best response time and precise information. Also, analysis of the multilayer perception neural network, naïve Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and C5.0 on a real-world data of bank was done to improve effectiveness for campaign by analyzing the most useful features that influence campaign success. Results offer how the proposed EEBMIS-DWMP developed bank organizations by comparing performance of system with and without index view in terms of balance accuracy, accuracy, precision, recall, mean absolute error, root mean square error, F measure and running time. Conclusions from results offers that EEBMIS-DWMP can construct a database for each customer, a storage system that integrates data from a variety of sources into a single unified framework, decrease errors and time required to prepare financial reports, quickly access for information, analysis of data in multivariate, accurate prediction of competent, profitability segmentation. © 2022",Data mining; Data warehouse; Index view; Management information system; Marketing,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-data mining
Identifying a good business location using prescriptive analytics: Restaurant location recommendation based on spatial data mining,Han S.; Chen L.; Su Z.; Gupta S.; Sivarajah U.,2024,10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.114691,"This study proposes a new prescriptive analytics method that aims to provide decision-makers with a systematic and objective approach to identify suitable locations, considering the spatial distribution of different types of restaurants. The method comprises of two main components: spatial co-location pattern mining and locationGCN, where locationGCN is based on graph convolutional network (GCN). The spatial co-location pattern mining is utilized to capture the spatial correlation of specific restaurant to determine the candidate location selection range. The locationGCN is designed to further screen out final suitable location ranges for the specific restaurant type. A case study using restaurant data from Xiamen Island collected from Dianping.com is conducted. The empirical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 74.88%, precision of 63.59%, and recall of 77.48%. Results indicate that the proposed approach can provide suitable location recommendations for specific types of restaurants based on existing restaurant distribution information. © 2024 The Author(s)",Co-location pattern mining; Graph convolutional network; Location selection; Transformative marketing,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-data mining
Multiple attribute behavioral decision-making model of internet consumers based on prospect theory; [基于前景理论的网络消费者多属性行为决策模型],Wen-Ming Z.; Shao-Jie C.; Xu W.; Hua-Qiong C.,2019,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2019.03.015,"Modeling the decision-making process of online consumers in a proper way can provide strategic suggestions on operation management and service marketing for electronic commerce firms. In recent years, many researches have tried to model the consumers’ decision-making process from different perspectives, like considering consumers' behavior patterns, integrating consumption theories, and utilizing different methods or tools. Most of these researches build models based on the Expected Utility Theory which depends on the ""Rational People"" hypothesis. However, online consumers often make some ""bounded rational"" or ""irrational"" decisions in an electronic commerce environment, due to peers’ influence. Therefore, Prospect Theory, which is dependent on the ""Irrational People"" hypothesis, is selected as the theoretical basis in this paper. We replace the traditional expected utility function with Prospect Theory’s value function to build a reasonable behavioral decision-making model. Moreover, an improvement in value function is acquired by the introduction of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number. We provide our approach in detail as follows. First, we construct the behavioral decision-making model based on Prospect Theory. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy number is introduced to express fuzzy decision-making information, which brings about improved value function, improved weight function as well as improved prospect function. We also build a more appropriate behavioral decision-making model. Therefore, we have determined the basic form of the model. Secondly, the whole service process of B2C electronic commerce is divided into six sub-processes by using service blueprinting. Based on these six sub-processes, the multiple attribute decision-making problem is defined through the determination of the multiple attribute structure and the set of alternatives which includes three dominant B2C platforms in China, e.g. Jingdong (jd.com), Yihaodian (yhd.com) and Dangdang (dangdang.com). Hence, the behavioral decision-making model of online consumers based on Prospect Theory has been determined. Thirdly, the behavioral model of decision-making is quantified by means of text mining of the collected eWOMs (Electronic Word-of-Mouth). The details of the process are showed as follows. First, we construct a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for eWOMs, which classifies eWOMs into different service sub-processes. Then the eWOMs in different sub-processes are clustered by the use of Weka, which is a data mining kit. Based on the clustering results, we can define 13 evaluating indicators and their corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the eWOMs into intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers, which determine the parameters of our model according to the results of sentiment analysis. Therefore, the model is quantified. Finally, we take Jingdong, Yihaodian and Dangdang as examples to test the behavioral model of decision-making. Furthermore, the reliability of this behavioral decision-making model is identified by comparison with the model based on the Expected Utility Theory. The results show that: (1) Compared with the models which are based on Expected Utility Theory, the behavioral decision model proposed in this paper performs better to reveal the practical situation. (2) Results of the calculated examples show that Jingdong scores the highest prospect values, followed by Yihaodian and Dangdang. Clustering of eWOMs results in 13 indicators. Jingdong scores the highest prospect values in seven indicators, while Yihaodian scores the highest ones in four indicators. Though Jingdong takes the highest overall score, its score is the lowest one in after-sales stage, giving rise to a narrowed gap in total score. While Yihaodian’s excellent service recovery help itself to rank second. The results show that proper service recovery strategies contribute to the improvement of service quality © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",B2C e-commerce; Behavioral decision-making model; Electronic word-of-mouth; Intuitionistic fuzzy number; Prospect Theory,Zhejiang University,scopus-data mining

Identifying emerging hotel preferences using Emerging Pattern Mining technique,Li G.; Law R.; Vu H.Q.; Rong J.; Zhao X.,2015,10.1016/j.tourman.2014.06.015,"Hotel managers continue to find ways to understand traveler preferences, with the aim of improving their strategic planning, marketing, and product development. Traveler preference is unpredictable for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers. Data are derived from 118,000 records of online reviews. The methods and findings can help hotel managers gain insights into travelers' interests, enabling the former to gain a better understanding of the rapid changes in tourist preferences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Data mining; Emerging pattern mining; Hotel preference; Natural language processing; Travel behavior,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-data mining
A predictive analytics of physicians prescription and pharmacies sales correlation using data mining,Sohrabi B.; Raeesi Vanani I.; Nikaein N.; Kakavand S.,2019,10.1108/IJPHM-11-2017-0066,"Purpose: In the pharmaceutical industry, marketing and sales managers often deal with massive amounts of marketing and sales data. One of their biggest concerns is to recognize the impact of actions taken on sold-out products. Data mining discovers and extracts useful patterns from such large data sets to find hidden and worthy patterns for the decision-making. This paper, too, aims to demonstrate the ability of data-mining process in improving the decision-making quality in the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach: This research is descriptive in terms of the method applied, as well as the investigation of the existing situation and the use of real data and their description. In fact, the study is quantitative and descriptive, from the point of view of its data type and method. This research is also applicable in terms of purpose. The target population of this research is the data of a pharmaceutical company in Iran. Here, the cross-industry standard process for data mining methodology was used for data mining and data modeling. Findings: With the help of different data-mining techniques, the authors could examine the effect of the visit of doctors overlooking the pharmacies and the target was set for medical representatives on the pharmaceutical sales. For that matter, the authors used two types of classification rules: decision tree and neural network. After the modeling of algorithms, it was determined that the two aforementioned rules can perform the classification with high precision. The results of the tree ID3 were analyzed to identify the variables and path of this relationship. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to provide the real-world direct empirical evidence of “Analytics of Physicians Prescription and Pharmacies Sales Correlation Using Data Mining.” The results showed that the most influential variables of “the relationship between doctors and their visits to pharmacies,” “the length of customer relationship” and “the relationship between the sale of pharmacies and the target set for medical representatives” were “deviation from the implementation plan.” Therefore, marketing and sales managers must pay special attention to these factors while planning and targeting for representatives.

Methods of variable pre-selection for net score modeling,Michel R.; Schnakenburg I.; von Martens T.,2013,10.1108/JRIM-03-2013-0017,"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on different approaches to variable pre-selection for building net score models (also known as uplift modelling or incremental response modelling). The application of these models supports the identification of customers whose response can be traced back to be an effect of the campaign under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: First, a net scoring methodology based on decision trees is presented. Then, derived from research contributions on this subject and analytics performed on real data from the financial sector, different approaches of variable pre-selection are discussed and compared numerically. Findings: Net-χ2 and net information value as well as the rank lift impact correlation for interval variables would be preferred when performing variable pre-selection for net score models. Simulations showed that the results were relatively stable with respect to the number of cross-validation samples. Practical implications: Variable pre-selection is required since it reduces computational effort that comes along with the complexity of net score models and the availability of a large amount of potential predictors. Some pre-selection methods result in a set of predictors quite close to the application of net scores itself. Originality/value: Despite its lever on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, only few contributions address net scores up to now and yet fewer authors deal with variable pre-selection for those models.

Deep neural networks for the classification of bank marketing data using data reduction techniques,Krishna C.L.; Reddy P.V.S.,2019,10.35940/ijrte.C5522.098319,"The amount of data belonging to different domains are being stored rapidly in various repositories across the globe. Extracting useful information from the huge volumes of data is always difficult due to the dynamic nature of data being stored. Data Mining is a knowledge discovery process used to extract the hidden information from the data stored in various repositories, termed as warehouses in the form of patterns. One of the popular tasks of data mining is Classification, which deals with the process of distinguishing every instance of a data set into one of the predefined class labels. Banking system is one of the real-world domains, which collects huge number of client data on a daily basis. In this work, we have collected two variants of the bank marketing data set pertaining to a Portuguese financial institution consisting of 41188 and 45211 instances and performed classification on them using two data reduction techniques. Attribute subset selection has been performed on the first data set and the training data with the selected features are used in classification. Principal Component Analysis has been performed on the second data set and the training data with the extracted features are used in classification. A deep neural network classification algorithm based on Backpropagation has been developed to perform classification on both the data sets. Finally, comparisons are made on the performance of each deep neural network classifier with the four standard classifiers, namely Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, Support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. It has been found that the deep neural network classifier outperforms the existing classifiers in terms of accuracy. © BEIESP.",Attribute Subset Selection; Classification; Data Mining; Deep Neural Networks; Principal Component Analysis,Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication,scopus-data mining

The state of lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance,Wu M.; Andreev P.; Benyoucef M.,2024,10.1007/s10799-023-00388-w,"Although lead scoring is an essential component of lead management, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review and a classification framework dedicated to it. Lead scoring is an effective and efficient way of measuring the quality of leads. In addition, as a critical Information Technology tool, a proper lead scoring model acts as an alleviator to weaken the conflicts between sales and marketing functions. Yet, little is known regarding lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. Lead scoring models are commonly categorized into two classes: traditional and predictive. While the former primarily relies on the experience and knowledge of salespeople and marketers, the latter utilizes data mining models and machine learning algorithms to support the scoring process. This study aims to review and analyze the existing literature on lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine lead scoring models. A total of 44 studies have met the criteria and were included for analysis. Fourteen metrics were identified to measure the impact of lead scoring models on sales performance. With the increased use of data mining and machine learning techniques in the fourth industrial revolution, predictive lead scoring models are expected to replace traditional lead scoring models as they positively impact sales performance. Despite the relative cost of implementing and maintaining predictive lead scoring models, it is still beneficial to supersede traditional lead scoring models, given the higher effectiveness and efficiency of predictive lead scoring models. This study reveals that classification is the most popular data mining model, while decision tree and logistic regression are the most applied algorithms among all the predictive lead scoring models. This study contributes by systematizing and recommending which machine learning method (i.e., supervised and/or unsupervised) shall be used to build predictive lead scoring models based on the integrity of different types of data sources. Additionally, this study offers both theoretical and practical research directions in the lead scoring field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Data mining model; Lead scoring model; Machine learning algorithm; Sales performance; Systematic literature review,Springer,scopus-data mining
Mining longitudinal user sessions with deep learning to extend the boundary of consumer priming,Cheng L.-C.; Chen K.,2022,10.1016/j.dss.2022.113864,"Priming is challenging when consumers start shortlisting products before the final purchase. This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques.

Online ad effectiveness evaluation with a two-stage method using a Gaussian filter and decision tree approach,Wang H.; Hong M.,2019,10.1016/j.elerap.2019.100852,"Online ads play create opportunities for advisers to discover potential customers by delivering marketing messages through the Internet. Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profit. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible.

A Text Mining Analysis of Academic Libraries' Tweets,Al-Daihani S.M.; Abrahams A.,2016,10.1016/j.acalib.2015.12.014,"This study applies a text mining approach to a significant dataset of tweets by academic libraries. The dataset for this research was collected from the complete Twitter timelines of ten academic libraries. The total dataset comprised 23,707 tweets with 17,848 mentions, 7625 hashtags, and 5974 retweets. Academic libraries from the dataset have typically posted fewer than 50 tweets per month, though tweet volume grew rapidly in late-2013 through 2014. The results show variance between academic libraries in distribution of tweets over time. The most frequent word was ""open,"" which was used in a variety of contexts by the academic libraries. It was noted that the most frequent bi-gram (two-word sequence) in the aggregated tweets was ""special collections"". The most frequent tri-gram (three-word sequence) was ""save the date"". The most frequent word categories in the semantic analysis for most libraries were related to ""knowledge, insight, and information concerning personal and cultural relations"". The most common category of the tweets was ""Resources"" among all the selected academic libraries. These findings highlight the importance of using data- and text-mining approaches in understanding the aggregate social data of academic libraries to aid in decision-making and strategic planning for patron outreach and marketing of services. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Academic libraries; Content analysis; Data mining; Social media; Text mining; Twitter,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-data mining
Practical differentially private online advertising,Sun J.; Zhao L.; Liu Z.; Li Q.; Deng X.; Wang Q.; Jiang Y.,2022,10.1016/j.cose.2021.102504,"Powered by machine learning technology, online advertising achieves accurate advertisement delivery to potential customers according to online user profiles. However, it raises serious privacy concerns since the learning process may reveal sensitive information in the profiles. It is highly desirable to provide high-quality advertisement recommendations while respecting an individual's privacy. To address the privacy issues, we propose a practical privacy-preserving system that predicts advertisement Click Through Rate (CTR) accurately without revealing any sensitive information of individuals. Our system combines both offline and online training to achieve the goal. In the offline training phase, we develop two differentially private algorithms built upon Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) algorithms, respectively, to transform features and train a privacy-preserving offline model. In the online training phase, we propose a privacy-preserving online learning algorithm to compensate for the decline of offline performance when online feature changes occur. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our system based on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can protect user privacy without compromising the accuracy of CTR prediction, with reasonable computation overhead. © 2021",Data perturbation; Differential privacy; Learning and optimization; Online advertising; Recommendation system,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-data mining

Will they stay or will they go? Predicting customer churn in the energy sector,Vezzoli M.; Zogmaister C.; Van den Poel D.,2020,,"The liberalisation of the European energy market has driven changes in the way firms approach marketing, both for the acquisition of new consumers and for retaining existing ones. To retain consumers, practitioners aim to predict which consumers intend to churn (ie leave), and to understand the reasons behind this intention. To address this need, this study uses data-mining techniques to develop a churn prediction model. The study aims to identify the information that is predictive of churn and, consequently, to shed light on the psychological reasons behind churn. The authors built eight predictive models using decision trees, random forest and logistic regression on a dataset composed of 81,813 consumers of an energy provider, each with one residential electricity contract. The logistic regression was found to outperform the other methods. The discussion focuses on the relevant predictors of churn by addressing a posteriori psychological explanations of consumers’ churn behaviour. The study provides new insights on the reasons why customers churn and, by addressing theoretical psychological explanations, provides a data-mining model with robustness to contextual changes. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Churn prediction model; Consumer psychology; Customer churn; Energy market; Machine learning,Henry Stewart Publications,scopus-data mining
Empowering CRM through business intelligence applications: A study in the telecommunications sector,Al-Zadjali M.; Ali Al-Busaidi K.,2018,10.4018/IJKM.2018100105,"The application of business intelligence (BI) techniques for knowledge discovery and decision support empowers organizations in different functions. This article examines the impacts of BI on customer relationship management (CRM) functions (marketing, sales and customer services) in the telecommunications sector. The literature found that BI application in CRM in a telecommunications context is limited but necessary due to the high rate of competition between service providers and the massive data generated by subscribers. This study surveyed employees' perspectives from telecommunications companies in Oman, and results demonstrated mixed impacts. First, the results showed that implementing BI in marketing has a positive impact on business processes values, customer values, but a negative impact on employees' values. Second, implementing BI in sales has a positive impact on financial values and employees' values, but a negative impact on business processes values, and customers' values. Finally, implementing BI in customer service has a positive impact on employees' values.

Ihimod-perturb: Histogram modification based reversible data perturbation algorithm for adaptable privacy preservation and integrity,Shah A.K.; Gulati R.M.,2019,,"With the advent of users’ perspective to store personal information digitized, measures to protect their private information has necessitated. Organizations also publish anonymous data to facilitate research in social science, healthcare, identification of fraudulent users, and trend analysis to foster sales and marketing techniques. Privacy Preserving Data Mining [PPDM] protects the disclosure of sensitive information present in the published datasets. Most of the existing pool of algorithms perturb the attributes forbidding verification of original data at receivers’ end. This paper introduces a Reversible Data Perturbation iHiMod-Perturb approach efficient in privacy preservation and enabling recovery of original data, if needed, at the receiver end. Unlike traditional methods that adds/multiply noise or randomly project data, our method uses differences of adjoining values as basis for modification to perturb sensitive attributes. Selection of privacy factor and embedding of digital watermark ensures data integrity along with perturbation. The privacy factor enables user specific adaptable privacy preservation model in contrast to one-level model. Experiments are performed on five datasets from UCI Repository and confirms that the Classification Accuracy of the perturbed dataset is preserved well. Experiments also suggest that the Probability Information Loss [PIL] is less than 25% and Disclosure Risk [DR] is less than 8% after application of iHiMod-Perturb algorithm. © IJSTR 2019.",Decision Tree; Histogram Modification; Naïve Bayes; Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Reversible Data Perturbation; Support Vector Machines,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,scopus-data mining
EBOC: Ensemble-Based Ordinal Classification in Transportation,Yildirim P.; Birant U.K.; Birant D.; Moghaddam M.H.Y.,2019,10.1155/2019/7482138,"Learning the latent patterns of historical data in an efficient way to model the behaviour of a system is a major need for making right decisions. For this purpose, machine learning solution has already begun its promising marks in transportation as well as in many areas such as marketing, finance, education, and health. However, many classification algorithms in the literature assume that the target attribute values in the datasets are unordered, so they lose inherent order between the class values. To overcome the problem, this study proposes a novel ensemble-based ordinal classification (EBOC) approach which suggests bagging and boosting (AdaBoost algorithm) methods as a solution for ordinal classification problem in transportation sector. This article also compares the proposed EBOC approach with ordinal class classifier and traditional tree-based classification algorithms (i.e., C4.5 decision tree, RandomTree, and REPTree) in terms of accuracy.

"Analyzing the past, improving the future: a multiscale opinion tracking model for optimizing business performance",Sigari S.; Gandomi A.H.,2022,10.1057/s41599-022-01325-y,"The complexity of business decision-making has increased over the years. It is essential for managers to gain a confident understanding of their business environments in order to make successful decisions. With the growth of opinion-rich web resources such as social media, discussion forums, review sites, news corpora, and blogs available on the internet, product and service reviews have become an essential source of information. In a data-driven world, they will improve services and operational insights to achieve real business benefits and help enterprises remain competitive. Despite the prevalence of textual data, few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of real-time text mining and reporting tools in firms and organizations. To address this aspect of decision-making, we have developed and evaluated an unsupervised learning system to automatically extract and classify topics and their emotion score in text streams. Data were collected from commercial websites, open-access databases, and social networks to train the model. In the experiment, the polarity score was quantified at four different levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and the entire text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using subjective data mining, we demonstrate how to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of information from the Web and help traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to capture more information. An opinion tracking system presented by our model extracts subjective information, classifies them, and tracks opinions by utilizing location, time, and reviewers’ positions. Using the online-offline data collection technique, we can update the library topic in real-time to provide users with a market opinion tracker. For marketing or economic research, this approach may be useful. In the experiment, the new model is applied to a case study to demonstrate how the business process improves. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Springer Nature,scopus-data mining
INTEGRATED APPROACH OF FUZZY MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION MAKING AND DATA MINING FOR CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION,Ray M.; Ray M.; Muduli K.; Banaitis A.; Kumar A.,2021,10.15240/tul/001/2021-4-011,"This research work focuses on integrating the multi attribute decision making with data mining in a fuzzy decision environment for customer relationship management. The main objective is to analyse the relation between multi attribute decision making and data mining considering a complex problem of ordering customers segments, which is based on four criteria of customer’s life time value, viz. length (L), recency (R), frequency (F) and monetary value (M). The proposed integrated approach involves fuzzy C-means (FCM) cluster analysis as data mining tool. The experiment conducted using MATLAB 12.0 for identifying eight clusters of customers. The two multi attribute decision making tools i.e., fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) are used for ranking these identified clusters. The applicability of the integrated decision making technique is also demonstrated in this paper considering the case of Indian retail sector. This research collected responses from nine experts from Indian retail industry regarding their perception of relative importance of four criteria of customer life value and evaluated weights of each criterion using fuzzy AHP. Transaction data of 18 months of the case retail store was analysed to segment 1,600 customers into eight clusters using fuzzy c-means clustering analysis technique. Finally, these eight clusters were ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The findings of this research could be helpful for firms in identifying the more valuable customers for them and allocate more resources to satisfy them. The findings will be also helpful in developing different loyalty program strategies for customers of different clusters. © 2021, Technical University of Liberec.

Risk factors selection with data mining methods for insurance premium ratemaking; [Odabir faktora rizika metodama rudarenja podataka za izracun stopa premije osiguranja],Omerašević A.; Selimović J.,2020,10.18045/zbefri.2020.2.667,"Insurance companies that have adopted the application of data mining methods in their business have become more competitive in the insurance market. Data mining methods provides the insurance industry with numerous advantages: shorter data processing times, more sophisticated methods for more accurate data analysis, better decision-making, etc. Insurance companies use data mining methods for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to fraud prevention. The process of insurance premium pricing was one of the first applications of data mining methods in insurance industry. The application of the data mining method in this paper aims to improve the results in the process of non-life insurance premium ratemaking. The improvement is reflected in the choice of predictors or risk factors that have an impact on insurance premium rates. The following data mining methods for the selection of prediction variables were investigated: Forward Stepwise, Decision trees and Neural networks.

Effective customer selection for marketing campaigns based on net scores,Michel R.; Schnakenburg I.; von Martens T.,2017,10.1108/JRIM-10-2015-0080,"Purpose: This paper aims to address the effective selection of customers for direct marketing campaigns. It introduces a new method to forecast campaign-related uplifts (also known as incremental response modeling or net scoring). By means of these uplifts, only the most responsive customers are targeted by a campaign. This paper also aims at calculating the financial impact of the new approach compared to the classical (gross) scoring methods. Design/methodology/approach: First, gross and net scoring approaches to customer selection for direct marketing campaigns are compared. After that, it is shown how net scoring can be applied in practice with regard to different strategical objectives. Then, a new statistic for net scoring based on decision trees is developed. Finally, a business case based on real data from the financial sector is calculated to compare gross and net scoring approaches. Findings: Whereas gross scoring focuses on customers with a high probability of purchase, regardless of being targeted by a campaign, net scoring identifies those customers who are most responsive to campaigns. A common scoring procedure – decision trees – can be enhanced by the new statistic to forecast those campaign-related uplifts. The business case shows that the selected scoring method has a relevant impact on economical indicators. Practical implications: The contribution of net scoring to campaign effectiveness and efficiency is shown by the business case. Furthermore, this paper suggests a framework for customer selection, given strategical objectives, e.g. minimizing costs or maximizing (gross or lift)-added value, and presents a new statistic that can be applied to common scoring procedures. Originality/value: Despite its lever on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, only few contributions address net scores up to now. The new χ2-statistic is a straightforward approach to the enhancement of decision trees for net scoring. Furthermore, this paper is the first to the application of net scoring with regard to different strategical objectives. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Customer analytics; Data mining; Database marketing; Direct marketing,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-data mining
A Demonstration of regression false positive selection in data mining,Pinder J.P.,2014,10.1111/dsji.12037,"Business analytics courses, such as marketing research, data mining, forecasting, and advanced financial modeling, have substantial predictive modeling components. The predictive modeling in these courses requires students to estimate and test many linear regressions. As a result, false positive variable selection (type I errors) is nearly certain to occur. This article describes an in-class demonstration that shows the frequency and impact of false positives on data mining regression-based predictive modeling. In this demonstration, 500 randomly generated independent (X) variables are individually regressed against a single, randomly generated (Y) variable, and the resulting 500 p-values are sorted and examined. This experiment is repeated and the distribution of the number of variables significant at the 5% level resulting from this simulation is presented and discussed. The demonstration provides a tangible example in which students see the reality and risks of incorrectly inferring statistical significance of independent regression variables. Students have expressed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the risks of type I errors through this demonstration. This demonstration is innovative because the scale of the simulation allows the students to experience the near certainty that the correlations shown in the results are truly random. © 2014 Decision Sciences Institute.",Business Analytics; Hypothesis testing; Regression; Simulation,Wiley-Blackwell,scopus-data mining
Frontiers: Polarized America: From Political Polarization to Preference Polarization,Schoenmueller V.; Netzer O.; Stahl F.,2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1408,"In light of the widely discussed political divide and increasing societal polarization, we investigate in this paper whether the polarization of political ideology extends to consumers’ preferences, intentions, and purchases. Using three different data sets—the publicly available social media data of over three million brand followerships of Twitter users, a YouGov brand-preference survey data set, and Nielsen scanner panel data—we assess the evolution of brand-preference polarization. We find that the apparent polarization in political ideologies after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 stretches further to the daily lives of consumers. We observe increased polarization in preferences, behavioral intentions, and actual purchase decisions for consumer brands. Consistent with compensatory consumption theory, we find that the increase in polarization following the election of Donald Trump was stronger for liberals relative to conservatives, and that this asymmetric polarization is driven by consumers’ demand for “Democratic brands” rather than the supply of such brands. From a brand perspective, there is evidence that brands that took a political stance observed a shift in their customer base in terms of their customers’ political affiliation. We provide publicly available (http://www.social-listening.org) access to the unique Twitter-based brand political affiliation scores. © 2022 The Author(s).",branding; data mining; political marketing; political polarization; social media,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-data mining

An exploration of the relation between the visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos: The case of branded video content,Koh B.; Cui F.,2022,10.1016/j.dss.2022.113820,"While browsing through an online video platform, potential viewers decide which videos to click and watch based on the information and impression they obtain from thumbnails. Therefore, a thumbnail needs to be able to tell potential viewers what the video is about (i.e., be informative), and at the same time, a thumbnail needs to grab potential viewers' attention (i.e., be visually appealing). Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we take the visual attributes that are relevant to the informativeness of thumbnails (e.g., element complexity and object complexity) as central route cues, take the visual attributes that are relevant to the aesthetics of thumbnails (e.g., celebrity endorsement, colorfulness, brightness, and image quality) as peripheral route cues, and explore the relation between these visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos using 3,745 marketing videos posted by 38 top brands across 4 industries – the automobile, beverage, restaurant, and toy industries – on YouTube. We construct our variables by extracting features from thumbnails using image mining techniques. Our study contributes to the literature on information systems and marketing by enhancing our understanding of the role of the visual attributes of images in persuading viewers in the online environment. Furthermore, our study provides a possible theoretical basis for studies on information processing and decision support that focus on automatic thumbnail selection. Finally, our study provides useful and practical guidelines for designing templates for optimal thumbnails that grab potential viewers' attention and yield more video views. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Branded video content; Elaboration likelihood model; Image mining; Thumbnails; Video view-through; Visual persuasion,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-data mining

Content marketing through data mining on Facebook social network,Forouzandeh S.; Soltanpanah H.; Sheikhahmadi A.,2014,,"As the Internet has found its place within different sectors of society, the use of various social networks is increasing and that is why they are utilized for business purposes. Most commercial companies need to do marketing in social networks in order to introduce their goods and/or services. In marketing, appropriate and accurate advertisement of goods based on needs of users of these social networks is required to sell the goods of different companies and manufacturing units in effective ways. In most cases, however, advertising and marketing methods in social networks are not correct and the resulted advertisements are boring and tiring to users and they might ignore them without noticing. Such advertisements will be considered as spam and will be annoying to network users. This is taken into consideration in the present study where users' interests, attitudes, and behavior on Facebook are specified through data mining techniques, based on which content marketing is conducted. The present study is conducted on the social network of Facebook, where content marketing, a new form of marketing, is utilized and instead of introducing the goods, the contents of different goods are presented. The data utilized in the study are actual and related to Facebook users, and therefore, the results can be generalized to other networks. © 2014, Saman Forouzandeh, Heirsh Soltanpanah, & Amir Sheikhahmadi.",Advertisement; Data mining; Decision tree; Marketing; Social networks,University of Tehran,scopus-data mining
Factors dominating individual information disseminating behavior on social networking sites,Shi J.; Lai K.K.; Hu P.; Chen G.,2018,10.1007/s10799-017-0278-8,"Identifying dominating features that affect individual information retweeting behavior on social networking sites (SNSs) is crucial to understanding individual retweeting behaivor and developing effective marketing strategies on SNS. However, there is little agreement on what factors are dominating individual information disseminating behavior on SNS, and what’s worse, more and more factors are added into the prediction model, without examining the relevance of them and even why these factors are added is rarely discussed. This leads to undesirable outcomes such as increasing the cost of measuring and computing irrelevant/redundant features. Most importantly, it hinders us from understanding what discriminative features are affecting individual information disseminating behavior. Using a unique real-life Twitter data set consisting of 55,575 twitterers and 9,440,321 tweets, the authors examine what discriminative features are dominating individual information disseminating behavior. The results indicate that topic distance is the most discriminative factor, highlighting that self-presentation motives play an important role in information disseminating decisions. Besides, the amount of information, social relationship and the popularity of the tweet also contribute to individual information disseminating decisions. Experiments demonstrate that adopting only dominating factors can improve prediction performance in terms of various indicators, compared with adopting the full features set. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing theoretical and practical implications of our findings. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017.",Data mining; Dominating features; Individual retweeting decisions; Information disseminating behaviour; Online marketing; Social networking sites,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",scopus-data mining

Research design, data and methodology: This quantitative research utilizes data-mining techniques and the RFM model to cluster a university's provider schools. The RFM model was modified by adapting its variables to the university's marketing context and adding a district's potential (D) variable based on heatmap analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) and K-means clustering. The K-prototype algorithm and the Elbow method were applied to find provider school clusters using the proposed RFM-D model. After profiling the clusters, the target segment was assigned. The model was validated using empirical data from an Indonesian university, and its performance was compared to the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)-based RFM utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. Results: This research identified five clusters. The target segment was chosen from the highest-value and high-value clusters that comprised 17.80% of provider schools but can contribute 75.77% of students. Conclusions: The proposed model recommended more targeted schools in higher-potential districts and predicted the target segment with 0.99 accuracies, outperforming the CLV-based model.

A data mining framework for targeted category promotions,Reutterer T.; Hornik K.; March N.; Gruber K.,2017,10.1007/s11573-016-0823-7,"This research presents a new approach to derive recommendations for segment-specific, targeted marketing campaigns on the product category level. The proposed methodological framework serves as a decision support tool for customer relationship managers or direct marketers to select attractive product categories for their target marketing efforts, such as segment-specific rewards in loyalty programs, cross-merchandising activities, targeted direct mailings, customized supplements in catalogues, or customized promotions. The proposed methodology requires customers’ multi-category purchase histories as input data and proceeds in a stepwise manner. It combines various data compression techniques and integrates an optimization approach which suggests candidate product categories for segment-specific targeted marketing such that cross-category spillover effects for non-promoted categories are maximized. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed procedure, we examine the transactions from a real-world loyalty program of a major grocery retailer. A simple scenario-based analysis using promotion responsiveness reported in previous empirical studies and prior experience by domain experts suggests that targeted promotions might boost profitability between 15 % and 128 % relative to an undifferentiated standard campaign. © 2016, The Author(s).",Association rule mining; Clustering; Cross-category purchases; Customized coupons; Target marketing,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,scopus-data mining

They can then convert the data to useful information or knowledge, which can help to formulate their business strategy. This cannot only facilitate marketing research in view of customer behaviour, but can also aid other management disciplines. Operations management (OM) research and practice with the objective to make decisions on product and process design is a fine example. Nevertheless, this line of thought is under-researched. In this connection, this paper explores the role of social media data in OM research. A structured approach is proposed, which involves the analysis of social media comments and a statistical cluster analysis to identify the interrelationships amongst important factors. A real-life example is employed to demonstrate the concept. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cluster analysis; content analysis; operations management; social media,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-data mining
The impact of social network analysis on telecommunication customers,Assaf R.,2020,,"Telecommunication industry has proven itself as a chain of socio-economic impact. Market leaders should take advantage of data analysis consecutively as the need to sustain customers the longest possible time. This research is based on community detection analysis through identifying group members and influencers in the telecommunication industry. It is motivated by two major research questions: Who are th e influencers in subscribers for churn and new products adoptions? (2) Who are subscribers whose loyalty is threatened by churn around them? The use of data analysis and data mining algorithms and standard process in today‘s challenges was set to increase the efficiency of solving not only technical problems but business as to move toward insights and analysis based exercises. This research proposes a model based on the Similarity, Authority and Hub algorithms used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) to group members who share same patterns together, to identify network leaders in terms of authority and dissemination leaders and to extract group level insights that can be used in understanding subscribers‘ patterns and ways of communications (in-degrees and out-degrees) between them using IBM SPSS Modeler as the base of data mining process and Oracle as the base of corporate data warehouse. This study estimated how much reliable is to use SNA in order to shift from the traditional ways of targeting subscribers, understanding their pattern, enhancing offering efficiency and improving the process of launching new product by selecting the right target. It has contributed to shifting marketing leaders‘ way of thinking from individual view to network view. It has also contributed to providing decision makers with a systematic and scientific approach as to focus on network influencers, to save as much as they can and to build their offers based on it. © 2020 IJSTR.",Authority; Data analysis; Data mining; Dissemination; SNA; Social network analysis; SPSS molder; SQL: SPSS Modeler,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,scopus-data mining
Influential factors for intention to visit an adversarial nation: increasing robustness and validity of findings,Stepchenkova S.; Kirilenko A.P.; Shichkova E.,2019,10.1108/IJTC-11-2018-0085,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the drivers of visitation intention, including demographic, psychographic (animosity, national attachment and consumer ethnocentrism) and image factors on tourist decision-making in a situation of bilateral conflict between the destination country and the source country, that is, the USA and Russia, respectively. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected at two different points in time from two different samples but analyzed with the same research question in mind. To increase the robustness and validity of findings, three analytical approaches from the repertoire of statistics and data mining techniques such as hierarchical linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree analysis were applied to two independent samples of tourists with different demographic profiles. This multiple methods research employs a complementary design, as methods used have equal importance and are applied concurrently. Findings: The paper obtained generally consistent results across methods and samples: general animosity, destination image and country image are the most influential factors in the tourists’ decision-making to visit a destination country with which their own country has strained bilateral relations. Practical implications: Destination image is highly important in all analyses and is more favorable than country image. It indicates some degree of separation of the two images in the respondents’ mind, which indicates that marketing a country as a tourist destination on a not-so-friendly tourism market may still be effective. Results also tentatively indicate that for young adults, patriotic feelings matter more in their decision-making, while for more mature tourists, ethnocentric tendencies play a more important role. Originality/value: The paper examines the influence of general and situational animosity, national attachment, and consumer ethnocentrism on visitation intentions in a situation of conflict between the two nations and, thus, expands the empirical evidence accumulated to date on tourist behavior in conflict. The paper acts on the premise that if a connection between any two variables truly exists, it should be able to withstand variations in samples, timing of data collection and measurement, thus, leading to more robust findings. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.",Animosity; Consumer ethnocentrism; Decision tree; Multiple methods research; National attachment,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-data mining
Comparison and positioning of NGOs aimed at children from the perspective of social marketing on Twitter,Galiano-Coronil A.; Alcedo-Velázquez M.Y.; Blanco-Moreno S.; Tobar Pesántez L.B.,2024,10.1057/s41599-024-02611-7,"The role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in disseminating and protecting children’s rights is fundamental by increasing society’s knowledge about the reality that children face, thus mobilizing citizen attention. In this paper, we present an original study on social media data, specifically Twitter, to analyze childhood NGOs, evaluating the success of their content (through the likes obtained by publications) from the perspective of social marketing and prospective theory. In addition, it examines the positioning of organizations concerning the types of messages identified. The methodological approach is based on data mining, content analysis, and simple correspondence analysis through which the typology of the messages and positioning map are determined. The results suggest that these organizations generate predictable communication by publishing on specific topics and only increasing the number of tweets in emergencies when they are requiring urgent help. Some tweets show an immediate risk to which children are exposed if they do not receive help, which aligns with one of the premises of the Prospect Theory. Furthermore, a more significant number of posts does not necessarily imply a greater number of likes. Three types of messages have been determined: informative tweets that point out risks (type 1), impartial dialogue tweets (type 2), and action tweets that highlight benefits (type 3), confirmed through the Kruskal-Wallis test to have a relationship with impact. The positioning map shows that type 3 messages, which World Vision Spain opts for, are the most popular, followed by type 1, which Educo leans towards. Finally, there are those of type 2, with which UNICEF Spain is associated. The main implication is that our analysis validates the use of social media such as Twitter to analyze NGOs and proposes these social media platforms to be an important tool in mobilizing the community. In addition, this study offers parameters when constructing the messages for use in social marketing campaigns according to decisions that involve risk or certainty. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Springer Nature,scopus-data mining
Using data mining to integrate recency-frequency-monetary value analysis and credit scoring methods for bank customer behaviour analysis,Khanbabaei M.; Parsi P.; Farhadi N.,2023,10.1504/IJDMMM.2023.134598,"Banks apply credit scoring to identify customers with low credit risk. Additionally, recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM) analysis method is suitable for identifying valuable bank customers. Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns hidden in customer data. However, in previous research, data mining has been used separately in both credit scoring and RFM approaches. To evaluate customer behaviour, banks must employ credit scoring and RFM analysis method, simultaneously. This study proposes a framework for using data mining techniques to integrate credit scoring and RFM methods in the field of banking. In this framework, k-means had better performance than Kohonen network and DBSCAN to identify and cluster valuable customers based on the RFM and credit scoring indices. Moreover, the C5 decision tree, BN, and SVM with 94.10%, 92.71%, and 92.36% accuracy had better performance to classify valuable bank customers based on RFM and credit scoring indices.

What drives a donor? A machine learning-based approach for predicting responses of nonprofit direct marketing campaigns,Cacciarelli D.; Boresta M.,2022,10.1002/nvsm.1724,"Direct marketing campaigns are one of the main fundraising sources for nonprofit organizations and their effectiveness is crucial for the sustainability of the organizations. The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted. Finally, this work shows and compares the classification results obtained with the combination of sampling techniques and Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and Artificial Neural Networks. The testing approach follows a walk-forward validation procedure, which simulates a production environment and reveals the ability to accurately classify each future campaign. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",direct marketing; machine learning; target selection,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-data mining

By using the developed formal model and the performed critical analysis of methods and technologies for predicting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency, we have built a general architecture of the content processing system that acquires data from different cryptocurrency Internet stock exchanges. General functional requirements to the intelligent cryptocurrency system that target the Internet users have been stated. We have investigated methods, models, and tools to improve the effective support for developing structural elements in the model of a decision support system that manages content according to the user's needs. general architectures of the backend and frontend parts of an intelligent cryptocurrency system have been devised. We also developed software for the system of integration and generation of content considering the cryptocurrency needs of users. An analysis of results of experimental verification of the proposed method for content integration and generation taking into consideration the cryptocurrency needs of users has been performed. A special feature of the system is that it analyzes information from social media and builds a forecast of currency rates based on the acquired information. A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate. The focus of the system is on the frequency of updates at the speed of data aggregation from the Internet stock exchanges and social networks. © 2019, V. Lytvyn, V. Vysotska, V. Kuchkovskiy, I.

An expert system to improve the functioning of the clothing industry: A development methodology,Santiago-Santiago K.; Laureano-Cruces A.L.; Antuñano-Barranco J.M.A.; Domínguez-Pérez O.; Sarmiento-Bustos E.,2015,10.1108/IJCST-08-2013-0084,"Purpose – Today the garment industry in México is vulnerable to complex problems. This type of industry is subject to influences which over time, modify the perceptions of those involved in the design process due to the fact that they face problems that have both objective and subjective characteristics. In this study the authors used interviews, direct observation methodology, and theoretical argumentation to obtain the experts knowledge as they describe the problems that arise in the process of garment design for Mexican markets. The purpose of this paper is to generate a methodology so that the expert in this field will become highly specialized, resulting in heightened abilities and reinforcing them with the methodology of soft systems and the design management model (DMM). The results suggest that they are applicable to any area of design. Design/methodology/approach – The success or failure of expert system (ES) depends directly on the acquisition of knowledge (Méndez-Gurrola, 2007, 2012), to accomplish that, three large groups of techniques are used to extract that knowledge: manual, semiautomatic, and automatic. Within the group of manual techniques, interviews, protocol analysis, questionnaires, direct on site observation, and the extraction of closed curves are emphasized. This technique is chosen for its ability to extract the particular type of knowledge being sought. The knowledge of the dominion expert in the design process applied to the clothing industry in México is based on processes and at the same time is episodic, meaning that part of the procedure is automated and each step of the process triggers the next. This knowledge is also based on experience which is of an autobiographical nature. Findings – First, when one simulates human behavior, the hardest thing is to choose a knowledge representation that conforms as closely as possible to its emulation. According to, choosing a given type of knowledge representation is an art that is discovered little by little. And this is true as one designs and assembles a representation, when one realizes how far the authors are from imitating the design of the human brain processes, and discovers or invents methodologies to achieve it, combining the results of investigations into knowledge representation, cognitive psychology, and cognitive engineering. Second, solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process. One needs the ability to identify the signals emitted by complex situations, and being able to stop them in time before they create irreversible damage. By merging the soft system methodology (SSM) and DMM with the experts’ abilities and knowledge (the result being the EXITUS model (EM)), makes knowledge modeling possible. A problem cannot be solved if it is unknown, if the problem persists and grows it becomes more complex. By describing a problem, based on: its origin, its relationship, and its effects, it also confers the ability to solve it. Thereby, an SBC with the characteristics presented in this paper, not only improves the design process function as a whole, it also contributes to achieving corporate success. Finally, it influences directly on: a quality product; market positioning; and good economic results. First, the SBC-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the SBC-EXITUS system, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Fourth, in this project an SBC named SBC-EXITUS has been implemented using the SSM and the DMM, with the purpose of detecting possible problems in the design process of the clothing industry. Its implementation is developed by the use of production rules. Fifth, utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation thnique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to other areas of design. Practical implications – Utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation technique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to the garment industry in the international context, as well as to other areas of design such as architecture, furniture, and others. The EM is a generic methodology. In this research and case, it has been applied in a design process within the garment industry, specifically in a case in Mexico. Yet this does not limit its use in a different context and problem situation. Having in mind the difference between countries in aspects such as sponsoring, technology, worker skills, marketing, etc. the tools for diagnostics in the Appendix 2, may be adapted to each context with enriched questions directed to specific aspects involved. Every new application allows facts and production rules that make the use of ES more efficient. Social implications – The ES-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the ES-EXITUS, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Originality/value – Solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process.

Differential game of product-service supply chain considering consumers’ reference effect and members’ reciprocity altruism under O2O mode; [O2O 模式下考虑消费者参考效应和成员互惠利他的 产品———服务供应链微分博弈],Deqing M.; Jinsong H.,2021,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2021.01.014,"The report “Accenture China Consumer Insight 2018 - New Consumption Power” published by FT Chinese Network and Accenture, a well-known international consulting company, has poined out one of the characteristics of new consumerism: experience is paramount. Consumers' demand for experiential shopping has led to the formation of a new sales pattern, and the O2O sales model emphasizing experiential marketing has become a hot topic of common concern in the business and academic circles. The formulation of product quality level and sales service level strategies by enterprises is often affected by both consumers’ behaviors and supply chain members’ behaviors: On the one hand, considering the influence of the difference between the reference level and the actual experience level on consumer demand, this paper incorporates both the reference quality effect of online consumers and the reference service effect on offline channels into goodwill dynamics and demand function of consumers. On the other hand, supply chain members often do not comply with the assumption of “economic man” in traditional economics when they interact with each other, While they often have a certain social preference - reciprocity altruism, that is, they not only consider their own benefits, but also pay attention to each other's benefits to a certain extent. For this reason, this paper regards the utilities maximization of reciprocity altruism as the objectives of supply chain members when making decisions. To sum up, considering the inherent dynamics of supply chain operation and consumers’ reference effects in the supply chain system under O2O mode which is composed of a dominated manufacturer and a retailer selling through both online and offline, the differential game models among decentralized, centralized and reciprocal altruistic decision-making pattern are constructed by using differential game theory, manufacturer's quality level strategy, retailer's dominant service level strategy, and supply chain's profits and utilities are obtains among three decision-making modes. Through comparison, we find that: 1) The reference effects of consumers cause the “anchoring psychology”, which leads to manufacturers' lowering quality level, retailers' lowering service level, and also damages the performance of the product-service supply chain. 2) Consumer's channel preference has an important impact on supply chain members' strategies and performance. Retailers should encourage consumers to purchase products online and use offline channel services as sales assistance measures to satisfy consumers' experience utility. 3) Members' reciprocal altruistic behavior as a positive social preference can obtain Pareto improvement in supply chain performance compared with decentralized decision-making model. and also result in additional social benefits; 4) If and only if both manufacturer and retailer have pure altruistic behavior preferences, i. e. the lowest return and the highest altruism, the total profit of supply chain can reach the situation of centralized decision-making. To this end, the management inspiration of this paper is: due to many management drawbacks of centralized decision-making, such as high management costs and difficulty in implementation, supply chain members should actively display the social preferences of mutual benefit and altruism, and deepen the vertical cooperation of supply chain on the basis of independent decision-making. On the one hand, manufacturer can improve product quality through product innovation, strictly control product quality to enhance brand goodwill, form quality identity and lay a good quality foundation for retailer sales links. On the other hand, retailer should undertake the sales link of supply chain to serve consumers' experience consumption: recommending personalized products to customers at lower cost through advanced technologies such as data mining, setting up 24-hour online customer service, solving customers' pre-sale doubts, reducing the adverse effects of reference service in online channel. While in offline channel, he can establish a reasonable membership system, take feedback promotion activities regularly and feed old customers to improve their retention rate and loyalty, even use word-of-mouth effect to attract new customers and tap new consumer market potential. Through the mutual benefits and altruism of manufacturer and retailer, the supply chain division of labor can be carried out to comprehensively improve the quality level and service capacity from the production end to the sales end, build brand goodwill, and promote win-win situation in all channels. © 2021.

The research's findings revealed the distribution of feeder schools in regencies/cities and the trend of enrolled students from the highest value feeder schools segment, which can assist university management in selecting target feeder schools more precisely. Based on the findings, decision-makers can create a geo-marketing strategy for promotional activities and direct resources to the prioritized feeder schools. This study contributes by reinforcing a modified RFM model with spatial and temporal analysis to help university decision-makers choose feeder schools as the university's target market and develop a geo-marketing strategy. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

A Location Analytics Method for the Utilisation of Geotagged Photos in Travel Marketing Decision-Making,Miah S.J.; Vu H.Q.; Gammack J.G.,2019,10.1142/S0219649219500047,"Location analytics offers statistical analysis of any geo-or spatial data concerning user location. Such analytics can produce useful insights into the attractions of interest to travellers or visitation patterns of a demographic group. Based on these insights, strategic decision-making by travel marketing agents, such as travel package design, may be improved. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an original method of location analytics to analyse travellers' social media data for improving managerial decision support. The method proposes an architectural framework that combines emerging pattern data mining techniques with image processing to identify and process appropriate data content. The design artefact is evaluated through a focus group and a detailed case study of Australian outbound travellers. The proposed method is generic, and can be applied to other specific locations or demographics to provide analytical outcomes useful for strategic decision support. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.",geotagged data; location analytics; social media; Travel agency; travel marketing,World Scientific Publishing Co.

An influence framework on product word-of-mouth (WoM) measurement,Chen K.; Luo P.; Wang H.,2017,10.1016/j.im.2016.06.010,"With the development of e-commerce platforms, online customer reviews have become an important instrument for providing product word-of-mouth (WoM) information. Analyzing and measuring WoM is quite valuable in product design, sales prediction, marketing strategy, and other decision-making tasks. In contrast to previous studies that analyze product WoM focusing on a single product, we propose an influence framework to measure WoM from a market perspective. In this framework, we combine product competition relationships and customer intercommunication relationships to construct a two-layer network and calculate the node influence effects in the network. To compare different product WoM measures, we use product sales as a predictor and build a series of predictive models. In the experiments conducted based on Amazon.com data, we find that, first, textual sentiment analysis produces a better summary of customer opinions than rating scores. Second, product-comparative relationships provide additional information on measuring product WoM. Third, the customer intercommunication feature in social media is useful for measuring the collective opinions about a product. The influence framework and experimental findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Product network; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-data mining

Mining the change of customer behavior in dynamic markets,Huang C.-K.; Chang T.-Y.; Narayanan B.G.,2015,10.1007/s10799-014-0197-x,"Identification of changes in customer behavior is a major challenge that must be tackled in order to survive in a rapidly changing business environment. For example, because information technology has advanced and data-storage costs have declined, for the purpose of serving customers, numerous enterprises have employed information systems and have directly logged customer behavior in databases. This trend has motivated the development of data mining applications. Fuzzy quantitative sequential pattern mining is a functional data mining technique that is used for discovering customer behavioral patterns over time and determining the quantities of goods or services they purchase. The example term used in shopping 〈[(Beer, Low)(Milk, High)] (Cola, Middle)〉 means that customers will first buy Beer and Milk in Low and High quantities, respectively, and then purchase Cola in Middle quantities on their next shopping trip, where Low, Middle, and High are predefined linguistic terms assigned by managers. A term such as this one provides managers with general and concise knowledge related to customer behavior and allows them to rapidly make decisions in response, especially in a competitive setting. However, literature searches indicate that no previous study has addressed the issue of changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. The aforementioned example pattern might have been available last year but might not be used this year, and it could have been substituted by 〈(Beer, Middle) {(Cola, Low)(Milk, Low)}〉. If this knowledge is not renewed, managers might develop inappropriate marketing plans for their products or services and use inventory strategies that are outdated with respect to time and quantities. To solve this problem, we propose a novel change-mining model that can be used for detecting changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. We conducted experiments in which we used real-world and synthetic datasets in order to evaluate the proposed model. When the pattern change was detected using the real-world dataset, the results showed that the model reveals 3 considerations that can help managers with their handling of products’ marketing and production. When we studied the model’s scalability by using the synthetic dataset, the results showed that even though all run times increased when parameter values were decreased, the model remained scalable. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Change mining; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Quantitative data; Sequential patterns,Springer New York LLC,scopus-data mining

Retail analytics: store segmentation using Rule-Based Purchasing behavior analysis,Bilgic E.; Cakir O.; Kantardzic M.; Duan Y.; Cao G.,2021,10.1080/09593969.2021.1915847,"Retailers are facing challenges in making sense of the significant amount of data available for a better understanding of their customers. While retail analytics plays an increasingly important role in successful retailing management, comprehensive store segmentation based on Data Mining-based Retail Analytics is still an under-researched area. This study seeks to address this gap by developing a novel approach to segment the stores of retail chains based on ‘purchasing behavior of customers’ and applying it in a case study. The applicability and benefits of using Data Mining techniques to examine purchasing behavior and identify store segments are demonstrated in a case study of a global retail chain in Istanbul, Turkey. Over 600 K transaction data of a global grocery retailer are analyzed and 175 stores in Istanbul are successfully segmented into five segments. The results suggest that the proposed new retail analytics approach enables the retail chain to identify clusters of stores in different regions using all transaction data and advances our understanding of store segmentation at the store level. The proposed approach will provide the retail chain the opportunity to manage store clusters by making data-driven decisions in marketing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, inventory management and demand forecasting. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",business analytics; Data mining; data-driven decision making; purchasing behavior; store segmentation,Routledge,scopus-data mining

Decision trees do not lie: Curiosities in preferences of croatian online consumers; [Stabla odlučivanja ne lažu: Zanimljivosti o sklonostima hrvatskih online potrošača],Filipas A.M.; Vretenar N.; Prudky I.,2023,10.18045/zbefri.2023.1.157,"Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers 'preference indicator. © 2023 All rights reserved",Consumers'preferences; Data mining; Decision trees; Decision-making; Shopping behaviour indicators,University of Rijeka,scopus-data mining

Segmentation Approach for Athleisure and Performance Sport Retailers Based on Data Mining Techniques,Rogić S.; Kašćelan L.,2021,10.4018/IJESMA.2021070104,"This paper seeks to compare certain customer segments from two sport footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers and to examine an objective market segmentation method, based on the recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) and the decision tree (DT) models. The case study is based on two data sets, aiming to compare the different customer segments, both from sport retail industry, and represents an application of data mining techniques in a business environment. The customer segmentation enables the customer selection for the future direct marketing campaigns based on the previous purchasing behavior. Analyzing the customers’ purchasing history can help the company determine the value of each customer and therefore target or not target such customers in the future with promotional materials, based on both the customers’ interests and their value. Thus, based on the results, personalized offers can be created for each of the defined customer groups, which may increase the efficiency of the overall campaign, reduce costs, and increase profitability.

Customer Response Model in Direct Marketing: Solving the Problem of Unbalanced Dataset with a Balanced Support Vector Machine,Rogić S.; Kašćelan L.; Pejić Bach M.,2022,10.3390/jtaer17030051,"Customer response models have gained popularity due to their ability to significantly improve the likelihood of targeting the customers most likely to buy a product or a service. These models are built using databases of previous customers’ buying decisions. However, a smaller number of customers in these databases often bought the product or service than those who did not do so, resulting in unbalanced datasets. This problem is especially significant for online marketing campaigns when the class imbalance emerges due to many website sessions. Unbalanced datasets pose a specific challenge in data-mining modelling due to the inability of most of the algorithms to capture the characteristics of the classes that are unrepresented in the dataset. This paper proposes an approach based on a combination of random undersampling and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification applied to the unbalanced dataset to create a Balanced SVM (B-SVM) data pre-processor resulting in a dataset that is analysed with several classifiers. The experiments indicate that using the B-SVM strategy combined with classification methods increases the base models’ predictive performance, indicating that the B-SVM approach efficiently pre-processes the data, correcting noise and class imbalance. Hence, companies may use the B-SVM approach to more efficiently select customers more likely to respond to a campaign. © 2022 by the authors.",customer response model; data mining; data pre-processing; direct marketing; support vector machine; unbalanced data,MDPI,scopus-data mining

A financial data mining model for extracting customer behavior,Mak M.K.Y.; Ho G.T.S.; Ting S.L.,2011,10.5772/50937,"Facing the problem of variation and chaotic behavior of customers, the lack of sufficient information is a challenge to many business organizations. Human analysts lacking an understanding of the hidden patterns in business data, thus, can miss corporate business opportunities. In order to embrace all business opportunities, enhance the competitiveness, discovery of hidden knowledge, unexpected patterns and useful rules from large databases have provided a feasible solution for several decades. While there is a wide range of financial analysis products existing in the financial market, how to customize the investment portfolio for the customer is still a challenge to many financial institutions. This paper aims at developing an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) for extracting customer behavior in the financial industry, so as to increase the availability of decision support data and hence increase customer satisfaction. The proposed financial model first clusters the customers into several sectors, and then finds the correlation among these sectors. It is noted that better customer segmentation can increase the ability to identify targeted customers, therefore extracting useful rules for specific clusters can provide an insight into customers' buying behavior and marketing implications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a simple dataset is collected from a financial company in Hong Kong. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can improve the workflow of a financial company, but also deepen understanding of investment behavior.

All that glitters is not gold: Digging beneath the surface of data mining,Danna A.; Gandy Jr. O.H.,2002,10.1023/A:1020845814009,"This article develops a more comprehensive understanding of data mining by examining the application of this technology in the marketplace. In addition to exploring the technological issues that arise from the use of these applications, we address some of the social concerns that are too often ignored. As more firms shift more of their business activities to the Web, increasingly more information about consumers and potential customers is being captured in Web server logs. Sophisticated analytic and data mining software tools enable firms to use the data contained in these logs to develop and implement a complex relationship management strategy. Although this new trend in marketing strategy is based on the old idea of relating to customers as individuals, customer relationship management actually rests on segmenting consumers into groups based on profiles developed through a firm's data mining activities. Individuals whose profiles suggest that they are likely to provide a high lifetime value to the firm are served content that will vary from that which is served to consumers with less attractive profiles. Social costs may be imposed on society when objectively rational business decisions involving data mining and consumer profiles are made. The ensuing discussion examines the ways in which data mining and the use of consumer profiles may exclude classes of consumers from full participation in the marketplace, and may limit their access to information essential to their full participation as citizens in the public sphere. We suggest more ethically sensitive alternatives to the unfettered use of data mining.",Analytics; Customer relationship management; Data mining; Marketing discrimination; Personalization; Price discrimination; Privacy; Profiles; Public sphere,,scopus-data mining
Capturing the essence of word-of-mouth for social commerce: Assessing the quality of online e-commerce reviews by a semi-supervised approach,Zheng X.; Zhu S.; Lin Z.,2013,10.1016/j.dss.2013.06.002,"In e-commerce, online product reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and the marketing strategies employed by vendors. However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results; (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers; and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Online review; Review mining; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Social network,,scopus-data mining

Integrating AHP and data mining for product recommendation based on customer lifetime value,Liu D.-R.; Shih Y.-Y.,2005,10.1016/j.im.2004.01.008,"Product recommendation is a business activity that is critical in attracting customers. Accordingly, improving the quality of a recommendation to fulfill customers' needs is important in fiercely competitive environments. Although various recommender systems have been proposed, few have addressed the lifetime value of a customer to a firm. Generally, customer lifetime value (CLV) is evaluated in terms of recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) variables. However, the relative importance among them varies with the characteristics of the product and industry. We developed a novel product recommendation methodology that combined group decision-making and data mining techniques. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to determine the relative weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. Clustering techniques were then employed to group customers according to the weighted RFM value. Finally, an association rule mining approach was implemented to provide product recommendations to each customer group. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach outperformed one with equally weighted RFM and a typical collaborative filtering (CF) method. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Machine learning for direct marketing response models: Bayesian networks with evolutionary programming,Cui G.; Wong M.L.; Lui H.-K.,2006,10.1287/mnsc.1060.0514,"Machine learning methods are powerful tools for data mining with large noisy databases and give researchers the opportunity to gain new insights into consumer behavior and to improve the performance of marketing operations. To model consumer responses to direct marketing, this study proposes Bayesian networks learned by evolutionary programming. Using a large direct marketing data set, we tested the endogeneity bias in the recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) variables using the control function approach; compared the results of Bayesian networks with those of neural networks, classification and regression tree (CART), and latent class regression; and applied a tenfold cross-validation. The results suggest that Bayesian networks have distinct advantages over the other methods in accuracy of prediction, transparency of procedures, interpretability of results, and explanatory insight. Our findings lend strong support to Bayesian networks as a robust tool for modeling consumer response and other marketing problems and for assisting management decision making. © 2006 INFORMS.",Bayesian networks; Data mining; Direct marketing; Evolutionary programming; Machine learning,,scopus-data mining
Customer relationship management in the network economy,Rygielski C.; Yen D.C.; Wang J.-C.,2002,10.1504/IJSTM.2002.001632,"The development of the network economy has transformed business practices. A major shift occurs in the marketing efforts. Given the abundant information on customers and products, marketing responsibility has changed from managing products for sellers to managing relationships with customers, and to facilitating decision-making for customers. These marketing efforts are essentially an intermediary of two-way communication between businesses and customers, and they would require data analysis techniques. Particularly through data mining, which comprises techniques for the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, organisations are able to identify valuable customers, predict future behaviours, and allow firms to make proactive, knowledge driven decisions. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each method having its advantages and disadvantages for different types of marketing purposes. This paper examines the issue of applying different techniques to meet the marketing requirements in the network economy. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). Two case studies are provided to illustrate how different data mining techniques can be utilised to accomplish various marketing efforts.

An experimental investigation of the impact of aggregation on the performance of data mining with logistic regression,Fadlalla A.,2005,10.1016/j.im.2004.04.005,"We studied the impact of data aggregation on the performance of logistic regression on predicting the direction of the Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA) stock market index. Data aggregation is a common operation in business, science, engineering, medicine, etc.; it is performed for purposes such as statistical, financial, and sales and marketing analysis - particularly within the context of a data warehouse. We showed experimentally that, for this example, as long as aggregation does not shrink the sample size unduly, it does not significantly impair the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting the direction of the DJIA stock market index. We also observed that aggregation-based models are simpler (less over-parameterized) than detail-based models. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the robustness of such predictive models. Specifically, we used the area under the ROC curve as a summary measure of the overall performance of a given model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Microtargeting and electorate segmentation: Data mining the American National Election Studies,Murray G.R.; Scime A.,2010,10.1080/15377857.2010.497732,"Business marketers widely use data mining for segmenting and targeting markets. To assess data mining for use by political marketers, we mined the 1948 to 2004 American National Elections Studies data file to identify a small number of variables and rules that can be used to predict individual voting behavior, including abstention, with the intent of segmenting the electorate in useful and meaningful ways. The resulting decision tree correctly predicts vote choice with 66 percent accuracy, a success rate that compares favorably with other predictive methods. More importantly, the process provides rules that identify segments of voters based on their predicted vote choice, with the vote choice of some segments predictable with up to 87 percent success. These results suggest that the data mining methodology may increase efficiency for political campaigns, but they also suggest that, from a democratic theory perspective, overall participation may be improved by communicating more effective messages that better inform intended voters and that motivate individuals to vote who otherwise may abstain. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Campaign strategy; Classification; Data mining; Domain expert; Domain knowledge; Microtargeting; Political marketing; Vote choice; Voting behavior,,scopus-data mining

Data mining course choice sets and behaviours for target marketing of higher education,Singleton A.D.,2009,10.1057/jt.2009.13,"As the higher education (HE) sector has expanded, so has the variety of courses on offer, with applicants now choosing between greater numbers of potential options. Where applications to HE are administered through centralised admission services, applicants will often make multiple initial course choices, which offers an opportunity to examine systematic groupings of interest within course choice sets, and assess whether certain types of student are more likely to make concentrated or diffuse subject selections. Utilising a national database of an entire cohort's application behaviour, the empirical findings presented in this article indicate that there are clusters of subjects that are applied for in combination, and that certain ethnic minority, socio-economic groups and neighbourhood types are more likely to make more diffuse subject choices. This creates an information base of generalised course choice behaviours that HE institutions could utilise for targeted marketing, recruitment and selection activities, and additionally forms the basis of a decision support framework that could be implemented in a variety of online tools to help guide student courses. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","Data mining, marketing; Geodemographics; GIS; Higher education",Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,scopus-data mining
Linking innovative product development with customer knowledge: a data-mining approach,Su C.-T.; Chen Y.-H.; Sha D.Y.,2006,10.1016/j.technovation.2005.05.005,"In today's digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset, and the implementation of knowledge management supports a company in developing innovative products and making critical management strategic decisions. Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely researched. To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer knowledge management for innovative product development. In the knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract customer knowledge from different market segments. An empirical study applying the E-CKM model has been carried out, and it meets the evaluation criteria in a multiple-assessment scheme for showing a satisfactory result. The result is used in the decision making for innovative product development in order to reduce project risk and secure commercial success. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A rough set based data mining approach for house of quality analysis,Li J.R.; Wang Q.H.,2010,10.1080/00207540802665907,"As the first phase of quality function deployment (QFD) and the only interface between the customers and product development team, house of quality (HOQ) plays the most important role in developing quality products that are able to satisfy customer needs. No matter in what shape or form HOQ can be built, the key to this process is to find out the hidden relationship between customers' requirements and product design specifications. This paper presents a general rough set based data mining approach for HOQ analysis. It utilises the historical information of customer needs and the design specifications of the product that was purchased, employs the basic rough set notions to reveal the interrelationships between customer needs and design specifications automatically. Due to the data reduction nature of the approach, a minimal set of customer needs that are crucial for the decision on the correlated design specifications is derived. The end result of the approach is in the form of a minimal rule set, which not only fulfils the goal of HOQ, but can be used as supporting data for marketing purposes. A case study on the product of electrically powered bicycles is included to illustrate the approach and its efficiency. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Data mining; House of quality; Rough set,,scopus-data mining
CORPORATE DIVIDEND POLICY DETERMINANTS: INTELLIGENT VERSUS A TRADITIONAL APPROACH,Longinidis P.; Symeonidis P.,2013,10.1002/isaf.1338,"Dividend is the return that an investor receives when purchasing a company's shares. The decision to pay these dividends to shareholders concerns several other groups of people, such as financial managers, consulting firms, individual and institutional investors, government and monitoring authorities, and creditors, just to name a few. The prediction and modelling of this decision has received a significant amount of attention in the corporate finance literature. However, the methods used to study the aforementioned question are limited to the logistic regression method without any implementation of the advanced and expert methods of data mining. These methods have proven their superiority in other business-related fields, such as marketing, production, accounting and auditing. In finance, bankruptcy prediction has the vast majority among data-mining implementations, but to the best of the authors’ knowledge such an implementation does not exist in dividend payment prediction. This paper satisfies this gap in the literature and provides answers that help to understand the so-called ‘dividend puzzle’. Specifically, this paper provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that data-mining methods perform better in accuracy measures against the traditional methods used. The prediction of dividend policy determinants provides valuable benefits to all related parties, as they can manage, invest, consult and monitor the dividend policy in a more effective way.

Role of knowledge management and analytical CRM in business: Data mining based framework,Ranjan J.; Bhatnagar V.,2011,10.1108/09696471111103731,"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the concepts of business intelligence (BI), knowledge management (KM) and analytical CRM (aCRM) and to establish a framework for integrating all the three to each other. The paper also seeks to establish a KM and aCRM based framework using data mining (DM) techniques, which helps in the enterprise decision-making. The objective is to share how KM and aCRM can be integrated into this seamless analytics framework to sustain excellence in decision making using effective data mining techniques and to explore how working on such aCRM system can be effective for enabling organizations delivering complete solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on focused and dedicated study of the literature present on the aCRM, KM and data mining techniques. The paper considered how to develop a strategy and operational framework that would build aCRM on the foundation of existing DM techniques and KM approach to meet the business challenges. Based on this research, a customized, integrated framework, to match the needs of business was designed. Findings: KM focuses on managing knowledge within the organization and aCRM focuses on gaining analytical information from the customer data. Both KM and aCRM help in the decision making process and understanding. This knowledge is difficult to uncover. Hence, this paper explains the importance of data mining tools and techniques to uncover knowledge by the integration between KM and aCRM. This paper presents an integrated KM and aCRM based framework using DM techniques. Research limitations/implications: All the firms may not be in favor of adopting KM while implementing aCRM. The KM requires a convalesce of organizational culture, technology innovations, effective work force in culminating knowledge dissemination in all business domains. Practical implications: The organizations implementing this knowledge enabled aCRM framework would be easily able to convert their business knowledge via the analytical CRM to solve many business issues, such as increase response rates from direct mail, telephone, e-mail, and internet delivered marketing campaigns, increased sales and increased services. With aCRM, firms can identify their most profitable customers and use this knowledge for promotional schemes for those customers as well as identify future customers with prediction on ROI.

It is written for practitioners who are looking for approaches to improve business performance and maintain high profits for their business by incorporating knowledge-enabled aCRM in their setup. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Business analysis; Customer relations; Data mining; Knowledge management,,scopus-data mining
Social media brand community and consumer behavior: Quantifying the relative impact of user- and marketer-generated content,Goh K.-Y.; Heng C.-S.; Lin Z.,2013,10.1287/isre.1120.0469,"Despite the popular use of social media by consumers and marketers, empirical research investigating their economic values still lags. In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice. © 2013 INFORMS.",Brand community; Communication mode; Conometric modeling; Consumer behavior; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-data mining
Mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions,Tsai P.S.M.; Chen C.-M.,2001,,"Previous studies on mining association rules focus on discovering associations among items without considering the relationships between items and their purchased quantities. However, exploring associations among items associated with their purchased quantities may discover information useful to improve the quality of business decisions. In this paper, we investigate the issue of mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions. When purchased quantities are considered, the supports of items associated with their purchased quantities may decrease drastically, and the number of potentially interesting association rules discovered will be few. In order to discover more potentially interesting rules, we present two partition algorithms to partition all the possible quantities into intervals for each item. We also propose an efficient mechanism to discover all the large itemsets from the partitioned data. Experimental results show that by our approach, the total execution time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, the potentially interesting rule discovered from the partitioned data can be considered to be a kind of generalized association rule. The generalized association rule is useful in marketing, business management and decision making, especially when the information from the rules generated from the original data is limited.",Data mining; Large q_itemset generation; Partition scheme; Performance study; Quantitative association rule,,scopus-data mining
Estimating the effect of word of mouth on churn and cross-buying in the mobile phone market with Markov logic networks,Dierkes T.; Bichler M.; Krishnan R.,2011,10.1016/j.dss.2011.01.002,"Much has been written about word of mouth and customer behavior. Telephone call detail records provide a novel way to understand the strength of the relationship between individuals. In this paper, we predict using call detail records the impact that the behavior of one customer has on another customer's decisions. We study this in the context of churn (a decision to leave a communication service provider) and cross-buying decisions based on an anonymized data set from a telecommunications provider. Call detail records are represented as a weighted graph and a novel statistical learning technique, Markov logic networks, is used in conjunction with logit models based on lagged neighborhood variables to develop the predictive model. In addition, we propose an approach to propositionalization tailored to predictive modeling with social network data. The results show that information on the churn of network neighbors has a significant positive impact on the predictive accuracy and in particular the sensitivity of churn models. The results provide evidence that word of mouth has a considerable impact on customers' churn decisions and also on the purchase decisions, leading to a 19.5% and 8.4% increase in sensitivity of predictive models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An excel solver exercise to introduce nonlinear regression,Pinder J.P.,2013,10.1111/dsji.12009,"Business students taking business analytics courses that have significant predictive modeling components, such as marketing research, data mining, forecasting, and advanced financial modeling, are introduced to nonlinear regression using application software that is a ""black box"" to the students. Thus, although correct models are estimated, students often do not obtain a thorough understanding of the nonlinear estimation process. The exercise presented in this article was created to demonstrate to students the need for nonlinear regression estimation-rather than using linear transformations and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and subsequently demonstrate the nonlinear optimization process to estimate nonlinear regression models. Using the spreadsheet exercise, students can see effects on the fit of the model by changing the model parameters as they change the values of the decision variables. After applying the spreadsheet to further exercises, students have expressed a deep understanding of the linear regression software. This exercise is innovative because the active learning exercise requires the students to make the logical connections between the structure of the model, the model's parameters, and the objective function. © 2013 The Author Decision Sciences © 2013 Decision Sciences Institute.",Analytics; And Regression; Nonlinear; Optimization,,scopus-data mining
"Discovering recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) sequential patterns from customers' purchasing data",Chen Y.-L.; Kuo M.-H.; Wu S.-Y.; Tang K.,2009,10.1016/j.elerap.2009.03.002,"In response to the thriving development in electronic commerce (EC), many on-line retailers have developed Web-based information systems to handle enormous amounts of transactions on the Internet.

Predicting Browsers and Purchasers of Hotel Websites: A Weight-of-Evidence Grouping Approach,Wu E.H.C.; Law R.; Jiang B.,2013,10.1177/1938965512468225,"A study of the online browsing and purchasing habits of some 1,400 outbound travelers in Hong Kong demonstrates the analytical power of weight-of-evidence (WOE) data mining. The WOE approach allows analysts to identify and transform the variables with the most predictive power regarding the likelihood of tourists' online preferences and decisions. The study found that just over one-third of the respondents browsed hotel-related websites, and about half of those browsers had booked a room on those sites. Browsers in Hong Kong tended to be young, well educated, and well traveled. Those who used the hotel websites for purchases were, of course, part of the browser group, and were likewise relatively well educated. However, one unexpected variable set off those who used the websites for a hotel purchase, the length of their most recent trip. One possible reason is that long-haul tourists want to be sure of their accommodations, or this may reflect hotels' free-night offers.

A hybrid approach for market segmentation and market segment evaluation and selection: An integration of data mining and madm,Aghdaie M.H.; Zolfani S.H.; Zavadskas E.K.,2013,,"Decision making in marketing becomes more and more sophisticated and two important issues in marketing decisions are market segmentation and segment evaluation and selection. These decisions are two focal points of all companies which many strategies are followed or influenced by them. Decision making is based on information and data mining aims to extract useful information form implicit, unknown and raw data. Clustering techniques are one of the widely used data mining tools which have been used for dividing market into different segments. In recent years, numerous papers about using data mining or multi attribute decision making (MADM) for marketing decisions have been published. MADM tools are used as a natural approach for evaluating alternatives with respect to conflict criterion. Thus, this study aims to integrate these two fields for improving quality of market segmentation's decisions. The proposed methodology is a combination of data mining tools for market segmentation and MA DM tools for evaluation and selection of the best market. More precisely, clustering is used to divide a whole market into different segments. Two MA DM tools including, step-wise weight assessment ratio Analysis (SIVARA) and complex proportional assessment of alternatives with grey relations (COPRAS-G), were applied for market segment evaluation and selection. The most desirable features influencing the choice of a market segment evaluation and selection are identified based on literature study. Grey relation analysis allows incorporating the vague and imprecise information in to the decision model. A real-world data on a laptop market is put forward to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology.

Applying a newly proposed association rule mining technique, this study investigates eWOM in the context of the tourism industry using an outbound domestic tourism data set that was recently collected in Hong Kong. The complete profiles and the relations of online experience sharers and travel website browsers are explored. The empirical results are useful in helping tourism managers to define new target customers and to plan more effective marketing strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Association rules; Browsers; Data mining; Electronic word-of-mouth; Hong Kong; Machine learning; Outbound tourism; Sharers,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-data mining
Market basket analysis - A data mining application in Indian retailing,Hemalatha M.,2012,10.1504/IJBIS.2012.046683,"Data mining has become a widely accepted process for organisations to enhance their organisational performance and gain a competitive advantage. Because the data mining process is a relatively new concept, it has been defined in various ways by various authors in the recent past. Data mining allows managers to make more knowledgeable decisions by predicting future trends and behaviours. One of the most widely used areas of data mining for the retail industry is in marketing. Market basket analysis is a marketing method used by many retailers to determine the optimal locations to promote products. The market basket is defined as an item set bought together by a customer on a single visit to a store. The market basket analysis is a powerful tool for the implementation of cross-selling strategies. This article has defined market basket analysis as a data mining tool used to extract important information from existing data and enable better decision making throughout an organisation. This article specifically focuses on the application of market basket analysis a data mining tool in Indian retail industries.

Customer value assessment of pharmaceutical marketing in Taiwan,Chuang Y.-F.; Chia S.-H.; Wong J.Y.,2013,10.1108/IMDS-01-2013-0045,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to provide a data mining approach for classifying Taiwanese healthcare institutions based on customer value assessment. Each institution type has developed its own marketing strategy along with relationship management strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Real transaction data from 88 pharmaceutical companies were the study samples. Expert interviews were conducted to analyze industry knowledge. The frequency, money, and contract term (FMC) model was developed to assess and segment the healthcare institutions. ANOVA and the Scheffe post-test were used to explore the test effects of each FMC indicator among the groups. The C5.0 decision tree was then used to generate the behavioral rules of various segmentations. Finally, this study combined the related variables with the purchasing behavioral rules to propose specific strategies for each type of healthcare institution. Findings - A total of 663 health care institutions in Taiwan were divided into four types: loyalist, intellectualist, nitpicking, and churn. The terms frequency (F), money (M) and contract term (C) were all significant indicators for determining the differences among the four customer categories at the 0.01 level of significance. The behavioral rules related to the four categories were determined by using the C5.0 algorithm. Originality/value - This FMC model can provide a strategic development method for the pharmaceutical industry to conduct market segmentation. The findings may assist pharmaceutical companies provide customized services to health care institutions and to manage their downstream demand effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Customer value; Data mining; Decision tree; Pharmaceutical marketing,,scopus-data mining
Warning system for online market research - Identifying critical situations in online opinion formation,Kaiser C.; Schlick S.; Bodendorf F.,2011,10.1016/j.knosys.2011.03.004,"More and more consumers are relying on online opinions when making purchasing decisions. For this reason, companies must have knowledge of the actual standing of their products on the Web. A warning system for online market research is being proposed which allows the identification of critical situations in online opinion formation. When critical situations are detected, warnings are subsequently sent to marketing managers and thus allowing marketers the ability to initiate preventive measures. The warning system operates on a knowledge base which contains product-related success values, online opinions and patterns of social interactions. This knowledge is acquired using methods coming from information extraction, text mining and social network analysis. Based on this knowledge the warning system judges situations accordingly. For this purpose, a neuro-fuzzy approach is chosen which learns linguistic rules from data. These rules are employed to estimate future situations. The warning system is applied to two scenarios and yields good results. An evaluation shows that all components of the warning system outperform alternative methods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Direct marketing decision support through predictive customer response modeling,Olson D.L.; Chae B.,2012,10.1016/j.dss.2012.06.005,"Decision support techniques and models for marketing decisions are critical to retail success. Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Customer behavior and decision making in the refurbishment industry - A data mining approach,Huang C.-F.; Hsueh S.-L.,2010,10.3846/jcem.2010.07,"The study of consumer behavior in the refurbishment industry is crucial to the business operation of firms, but there is a lack of research in this regard. With reference to the EKB model specific to consumer behavior, this paper discusses the relationship among consumption characteristics, firm selection behavior and satisfaction degree of refurbishment customers. 242 valid questionnaire copies were collected from refurbishment customers, and analyzed using Decision Tree Analysis and Association Rules in Data Mining. The research results show that, over half of the customers tend to entrust the refurbishment to well-reputed firms. Moreover, the integrity of refurbishment equipment, response of refurbishment personnel, professionalism and confidence are key elements in service quality (SQ). The best marketing policy for the customers is one which provides more attractive services.

Integrating the voice of customers through call center emails into a decision support system for churn prediction,Coussement K.; Van den Poel D.,2008,10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005,"We studied the problem of optimizing the performance of a DSS for churn prediction. In particular, we investigated the beneficial effect of adding the voice of customers through call center emails - i.e. textual information - to a churn-prediction system that only uses traditional marketing information. We found that adding unstructured, textual information into a conventional churn-prediction model resulted in a significant increase in predictive performance. From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to better identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using data mining to segment healthcare markets from patients' preference perspectives,Liu S.S.; Chen J.,2009,10.1108/09526860910944610,"Purpose: This paper aims to provide an example of how to use data mining techniques to identify patient segments regarding preferences for healthcare attributes and their demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Data were derived from a number of individuals who received in-patient care at a health network in 2006. Data mining and conventional hierarchical clustering with average linkage and Pearson correlation procedures are employed and compared to show how each procedure best determines segmentation variables. Findings: Data mining tools identified three differentiable segments by means of cluster analysis. These three clusters have significantly different demographic profiles. Practical implications: The study reveals, when compared with traditional statistical methods, that data mining provides an efficient and effective tool for market segmentation. When there are numerous cluster variables involved, researchers and practitioners need to incorporate factor analysis for reducing variables to clearly and meaningfully understand clusters. Originality/value: Interests and applications in data mining are increasing in many businesses. However, this technology is seldom applied to healthcare customer experience management.

Data mining techniques for customer relationship management,Rygielski C.; Wang J.-C.; Yen D.C.,2002,10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00038-6,"Advancements in technology have made relationship marketing a reality in recent years. Technologies such as data warehousing, data mining, and campaign management software have made customer relationship management a new area where firms can gain a competitive advantage. Particularly through data mining-the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases-organizations can identify valuable customers, predict future behaviors, and enable firms to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. The automated, future-oriented analyses made possible by data mining move beyond the analyses of past events typically provided by history-oriented tools such as decision support systems. Data mining tools answer business questions that in the past were too time-consuming to pursue. Yet, it is the answers to these questions make customer relationship management possible. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each with their own advantages and challenges for different types of applications.

Interactive media usage among millennial consumers,Moore M.,2012,10.1108/07363761211259241,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine a comprehensive model of millennial usage of interactive technologies in the current marketing environment based upon actual behavior. Design/methodology/approach: A data mining approach using decision tree analysis (DTA) generates two comparative models (i.e. millennial versus generation X and millennial versus baby boomers) of interactive media usage across 21 technology applications. A large national sample (n=3,289) sourced from the Kantar Retail IQ constitutes the data for the models. Findings: Millennial respondents indicate significantly higher usage of interactive media compared to both generation X and boomers across 14 applications. Models indicate that millennials use interactive technologies for utilitarian/information gathering purposes as well as for entertainment. However, they are less likely to purchase online compared to their older counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Models provide evidence that both supports and extends previous research into interactive media from a uses and gratifications perspective. Findings suggest theoretical directions for research for economic versus emotional uses of interactive media. Practical implications: Findings suggest that while millennials are adept at using technology for research and interactive purposes they tend to buy in stores, presenting opportunities for multiple channel marketers and challenges for those who market online exclusively.

Enhanced decision making using data mining: Applications for retailers,Anderson J.; Kotsiopulos A.,2002,,"As the economy has tightened, retailers have been challenged in recent years to be more strategic in their planning. They struggle to find answers to: • Who can I consider a loyal customer? • What kind of marketing strategy is most likely to increase sales? • What can customer-purchasing patterns reveal about improving inventory control? • What is the most effective way to manage customer relations to increase revenues? (Rabinovitch, 1999). With the exponential growth in the amount of data being collected, improvements in technology, and research in machine learning, retailers are now able to reduce the ever growing difficult and complex decision making process by recruiting the efforts of data mining (Barry & Linoff, 1997). Data mining is a computerized technology that uses complicated algorithms to find relationships and trends in large data bases, real or perceived, previously unknown to the retailer, to promote decision support. Currently being utilized by such retail giants as Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom, and Wal-Mart, Inc., data mining is touted to be one of the greatest technologies to hit the retailing industry this decade (Rabinovitch, 1999). The purpose of this study is to critique data mining technology in comparison with more familiar analytical tools for strategic decision making by small to medium size retailers.

Uplift modeling with value-driven evaluation metrics,Gubela R.M.; Lessmann S.,2021,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113648,"Measuring the success of targeted marketing actions is challenging. Research on prescriptive analytics recommends uplift models to guide targeting decisions. Uplift models predict how much a marketing action will change customers' behavior, known as the individual treatment effect (ITE). Marketers can then solicit customers in decreasing order of their estimated ITE. We argue that the ITE-based targeting policy is not fully consistent with a business value maximization objective. We propose business-centric evaluation metrics that integrate estimates of the ITE and the expected business value and validate their benefits relative to the ITE-based targeting baseline using real-world marketing data. The new metrics yield remarkably higher profit across different uplift models, targeting depths, profit functions, and data sets. They further contribute to the growing field of interpretable data science by uncovering interdependencies between covariates, ITE, and profit and by clarifying whether customers are worth targeting because of high responsiveness or high value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Evaluation metric; Interpretable data science; Target marketing; Uplift modeling,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-data science

Why domain knowledge is essential for data scientists in marketing,Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A.; Müller A.,2022,,"What good is the most scientifically valuable analysis if it piles up in marketers’ inboxes but does not give them the necessary foundation for their decisions? Such a situation is no use to data scientists and certainly no use to the marketing team. The root of the issue is that two worlds meet here that speak completely different languages. Only if data scientists can ‘translate’ their results into marketing language will their work be successful. Marketing teams do not need as much information as possible; rather, they require just the right information, preferably with recommendations for action that can guide their decisions. To select the information that is truly useful for marketing and communicate it in an understandable way, data scientists must have more than expertise in analytics methods and tools (which is assumed and therefore not discussed in detail here); they also need to know about marketing objectives and have a comprehensive contextual understanding of their company’s industry and sector, including competitors. Knowledge of the general situation in the world as well as the legal, political and religious particularities of the countries in which the company operates is also required. In short, analytics results that truly drive marketing can only be delivered by data scientists with domain knowledge. Using a case study from the field, this paper shows how data scientists can gain the domain knowledge they need to be successful in marketing and in which aspects of their work it helps them perform more effectively. © Henry Stewart Publications.",computer science; data scientist; domain knowledge in data science; marketing analytics; predictive modelling; statistics; success factors,Henry Stewart Publications,scopus-data science

Model selection using database characteristics: Developing a classification tree for longitudinal incidence data,Schwartz E.M.; Bradlow E.T.; Fader P.S.,2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0825,"When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the ""winning model"" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the ""legwork"" of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e.g., the ""back-and-forth"" migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e.g., the inclusion of an ""off"" state with no activity).

Data science has influenced all business functions in an insurance organization to provide a distinct competitive advantage and push the industry towards the vision of ‘Insure Tech’. This case revolves around one such application of analytics in HDFC analytics dealing with championing the initiative for forecasting and analysis of Business Persistency. The persistency ratio is actually a fairly simple, yet very important metric that provides a snapshot of the health of the insurance industry. Considering the importance of this parameter, it became extremely important for HDFC Life to understand the factors behind persistency numbers and what lies ahead for the organization. The existing forecasting techniques were biased by the nature of work and did not give a significantly accurate and realistic number. The top management found this to be challenging for decision-making and decided that this required the intervention of the Business Insights department. Mr. Francis Rodrigues, SVP—Data Labs, Business Insights and Innovation was given the task to take over the pilot project and increase usage of analytical tools for Persistency Analysis. While Quarter 1 results have been significant, Mr. Francis Rodrigues still wonders whether he captured all the internal and external measures to obtain effective results. Has he done enough and how many more areas can analytics be applied for in the insurance domain? Research Question/Purpose: The current methods of persistency calculation are biased by the nature of work and deflect by a huge margin from the numbers actually achieved. There are no realistic forecasts for the coming year making the management uncertain with the decisions they take for strategic purposes. Theory: Time-indexed collection data help in predicting persistency numbers which are also influenced by some important variables behind collection follow-up and categories of customers. Type of the Case: Applied problem solving. Protagonist: Not needed. Options: Due to the availability of time-indexed data, time series was considered to be the best approach to forecast values into the future. However, that would only solve one half of the problem. It was also important to understand the parameters affecting persistency numbers, important variables behind persistency collections and classify the customers based on such variables. With this knowledge, classification models were also taken into consideration. Discussions and Case Questions: Besides time-indexed collection data which other variables amongst policy and demographic parameters influence persistency parameters? How can insights be drawn about the factors that are actually affecting the persistency numbers? Will calculating and sharing monthly persistency numbers for the coming year improve the percentage of customers remitting payment on time? By classifying customers into various categories with regards to the frequency of follow-up required for premium collection can a favourable segment be carved out? © 2020 SAGE Publications.",business insights; data analytics; financial analytics; Life insurance; marketing analytics; persistency; sales forecasting; time series analysis,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-data science

A data science-based marketing decision support system for brand management,Chornous G.; Fareniuk Y.; Giedraitis V.R.; Ulvidienė E.; Kharlamova G.,2023,10.21511/im.19(2).2023.04,"To improve the marketing activity and brand management and justify the most effective marketing decisions, organizations should implement different information technologies, mathematical methods and models into the marketing decision support system (MDSS). The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analysis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attracting new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing investments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and business indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports. The research findings offer a scientific basis for making effective marketing decisions based on data, and the proposed MDSS can become part of an intelligent system for planning marketing activities. © Galyna Chornous, Yana Fareniuk, Vincentas Rolandas Giedraitis, Erstida Ulvidienė, Ganna Kharlamova, 2023.",decision-making; enterprise; intelligent agent; marketing mix; marketing strategy; modeling; multi-agent system,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,scopus-data science
Evaluating the creditworthiness of a client in the insurance industry using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system,Doskocil R.,2017,10.5755/j01.ee.28.1.14194,"The article deals with the issue of a client's creditworthiness assessment in the insurance industry. The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of new factors which have relation to a client’s creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client’s creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The knowledge gained from the evaluation model is immediately possible to use in the strategic management of insurance companies e.g. in marketing activities. © 2017, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The analysis is based on information obtained by direct inquiry to 99 small producers in the region, about planning, production, marketing and distribution in the chain, supplemented with secondary information sources. Design/methodology/approach: As a methodology an analysis of maturity in the chain based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration is done, whose evaluation is later analyzed as a fuzzy logic model, with the support of the fuzzy logic of the MATLAB toolbox, to study the convenience of the use of the contract against the other mechanisms, and to establish an approximation to the level of readiness of the chain toward integration. Findings: Results obtained show that the small farmer supply chain studied, from a maturity perspective, has a strong disposition for the use of contracts as an integration mechanism. Research limitations/implications: The supply chain for small producers presents a high dispersion, little consolidated offer capacity and lack of coordination. Limitations in terms of information and criteria unification are a challenge for future research. Results have socioeconomic implications for small producers and can serve as a guide to formulate policies by the governments in Latin American countries. Practical implications: As practical implications, it can be stated that the use of supply contracts is a real mechanism that can be implemented in this type of chain, to break the mistrust between the echelons and improve the supply chain performance. This research will allow to establish support programs from local governments for the sustainability and improving income of small producers. In addition, contracts will allow to formalize the linkage of small producers to a sustainable commercial network. Social implications: Small agricultural producers in developing countries live in unfavorable conditions, with socioeconomic limitations. This work offers an alternative for their productive activity development that will allow them access to marketing chains in a safe way and improve their living conditions.

A decision support system for sales forecasting through fuzzy neural networks with asymmetric fuzzy weights,Kuo R.J.; Xue K.C.,1998,10.1016/S0167-9236(98)00067-0,"Sales forecasting plays a very prominent role in business strategy. Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed statistical methods, such as regression or autoregressive and moving average (ARMA). However, sales forecasting is very complicated owing to influence by internal and external environments. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have also been applied in sales forecasting since their promising performances in the areas of control and pattern recognition. However, further improvement is still necessary since unique circumstances, e.g., promotion, cause a sudden change in the sales pattern. Thus, this study utilizes fuzzy logic a proposed fuzzy neural network (FNN) for the sake of learning fuzzy IF-THEN rules obtained from the marketing experts with respect to promotion. The result from FNN is further integrated with the forecast from ANN using the time series data and the promotion length through the other ANN.

Celebrity selection in social media ecosystems: a flexible and interactive framework,Shukla S.; Dubey A.,2022,10.1108/JRIM-04-2020-0074,"Purpose: Quantitative objective studies on the problem of celebrity selection are lacking. Furthermore, existing research does not recognize the group decision-making nature and the possibility of customer involvement in celebrity or influencer selection for social media marketing. This study conceptualizes celebrity selection as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem while deriving the final ranking of celebrities/influencers using interactive and flexible criteria based on the value tradeoff approach. The article thus proposes and demonstrates a quantitative objective method of celebrity selection for a brand or campaign in an interactive manner incorporating customer's preferences as well. Design/methodology/approach: Each decision-maker's preferences for celebrity selection criteria are objectively captured and converted into an overall group preference using a modified generalized fuzzy evaluation method (MGFEM). The final ranking of celebrities is then derived from an interactive and criteria-based value tradeoff approach using the flexible and interactive tradeoff method. Findings: The approach gives a different ranking of celebrities for two campaigns based on group members' perceived importance of the selection criteria in different scenarios. This group includes decision-makers (DMs) from the brand, marketing communication agency and brand's customers. Further, each group member has an almost equal say in the decision-making based on fuzzy evaluation and an interactive and flexible value tradeoff approach to celebrity selection for receiving a rank order. Research limitations/implications: The approach uses secondary data on celebrities and hypothetical scenarios. Comparison with other methods is difficult, as no other study proposes a multi-criteria group decision-making approach to celebrity selection especially in a social media context. Practical implications: This approach can help DMs make more informed, objective and effective decisions on celebrity selection for their brands or campaigns. It recognizes that there are multiple stakeholders, including the end customers, each of whose views is objectively considered in the aspects of group decision-making through a fuzzy evaluation method. Further, this study provides a selection mechanism for a given context of endorsement by objectively and interactively encapsulating stakeholder preferences. Originality/value: This robust and holistic approach to celebrity selection can help DMs objectively make consensual decisions with partial or complete information. This quantitative approach contributes to the literature on selection mechanisms of influencers, celebrities, social media opinion leaders etc. by providing a methodological aid that encompasses aspects of interactive group decision-making for a given context. Moreover, this method is useful to DMs and stakeholders in understanding and incorporating the effect of nature or context of the brand and the campaign type in the selection of a celebrity or an influencer. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Celebrity selection; FITradeoff; Fuzzy logic; Group decision-making; Multi-attribute; Social media marketing campaign,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-fuzzy logic

Despite the great advantages provided by online shopping for either consumers or retailers, there are certain issues that must be solved to improve online shopping advantages. Finding right size is one of the biggest barriers against apparel online retailing. Since the use of apparels is directly related with fitting, choosing right size is becoming more critical for retailers and consumers. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the solution of the problem. Design/methodology/approach: For the study, the specific size measurements of male shirts (collar, shoulder, chest, waist, arm length in cm) from four different sizes (small, medium, large, x-large) and from eight different brands were collected and stored in a database. Totally, weight, height and body measurements (collar, shoulder, chest, waist and arm length in cm) of 80 male candidates, between the ages of 18 and 35, were measured individually. These data were then used for experiments. Findings: Any product with known measurements can be compared with users’ body measurement based on fuzzy logic rule and the best-fitted size can be selected for users. Similarly, using the proposed web design, users are able to see desired products on users with similar body type. Originality/value: In this study, a new mathematical method based on fuzzy relations for apparel size finder is proposed. Beside, this method can group users based on body measurements in order to find people with similar size. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Apparel size; Fitting; Fuzzy modelling; Online marketing,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-fuzzy logic

Fuzzy importance-performance analysis for determining critical service attributes,Deng W.-J.,2008,10.1108/09564230810869766,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel approach of fuzzy importance-performance analysis (FIPA) to replace conventional importance-performance analysis (IPA) for determining critical service attributes those really need to improve for achieving superior customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach - First, referring numerous studies, conventional IPA has some erroneous assumptions, the customer satisfaction of attribute performance has the characteristic of three-factor theory and the novel approach which integrates natural logarithmic transformation and partial correlation analysis is feasible for acquiring the implicitly derived importance of attributes. Second, according the fact and nature of fuzziness in human perception, this study applies fuzzy set theory to revise conventional IPA. Finally, the FIPA is proposed and subsequently implemented in a Taiwanese hot spring hotel case study. Findings - The implementation of FIPA shows the determined critical service attributes are almost completely different from those attributes acquired by conventional IPA. Hence, the application of conventional IPA may cause practitioners make incorrect decisions of improvement priorities for service attributes and direct unsuitable quality-based marketing strategies. Originality/value - The proposed FIPA which integrates fuzzy set theory, three-factor theory, partial correlation analysis and natural logarithmic transformation avoids the erroneous assumptions of conventional IPA, considers the nature of fuzziness in human perception and includes the actual importance of service attributes. Therefore, the proposed FIPA can effectively assist business managers in determining critical service attributes to improve service quality or customer satisfaction and to achieve competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Customer services quality; Fuzzy logic; Performance measures,,scopus-fuzzy logic

A hybrid approach to achieve organizational agility: An empirical study of a food company,Nejatian M.; Zarei M.H.; Nejati M.; Zanjirchi S.M.,2018,10.1108/BIJ-09-2016-0147,"Purpose: In today’s intense global competition, agility is advocated as a fundamental characteristic for business survival and competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical methodology to achieve and enhance organizational agility based on strategic objectives. Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the organization being studied are recognized and classified under the perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC). Critical success factors are then identified by ranking the KPIs according to their importance in achieving organizational strategic objectives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In the second step, three houses of quality (HOQs) are constructed sequentially to identify and rank the main agile attributes, agile enablers, and improvement paths. In addition, in order to translate linguistics judgments of practitioners into numerical values in building HOQs, fuzzy logic is employed. Findings: The capability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a case of a multi-national food company in Iran. Through the application, the company could find the most suitable improvement paths to improve its organizational agility. Research limitations/implications: A limited number of KPIs were chosen due to computational and visual constraints related to HOQs. Another limitation, similar to other agility studies, which facilitate decision making among agility metrics, was that the metrics were more industry-specific and less inclusive. Practical implications: A strong practical advantage for the application of the methodology over directly choosing agility metrics without linking them is that through the methodology, the right metrics were selected that match organization’s core values and marketing objectives. While metrics may ostensibly seem unrelated or inappropriate, they actually contributed to the right areas where there were gaps between the current and desired level of agility. It would otherwise be impossible to choose the right metrics without a structured methodology. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel methodology for achieving organizational agility. By utilizing and linking several tools such as BSC, fuzzy TOPSIS, and quality function deployment (QFD), the proposed approach enables organizations to identify the most appropriate agile attributes, agile enablers, and subsequently agile improvement paths. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agile organization; Balanced scorecard; Enterprise agility; House of quality; Organizational agility; Quality function deployment,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-fuzzy logic

A modified CRITIC with a reference point based on fuzzy logic and hamming distance,Sharkasi N.; Rezakhah S.,2022,10.1016/j.knosys.2022.109768,"Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims to support decision-makers more effectively. This paper presents modifications for the criteria ranking methods, CRITIC and Distance-correlation CRITIC (D-CRITIC). These modifications involve the normalization procedure to silence criteria attribution by utilizing fuzzy logic and the hamming distance. Also, some adjustment to the weighting technique of the CRITIC method is done to capture linear and nonlinear correlations more precisely. These modifications that are applied to the CRITIC method by considering some reference point (RP), produced our proposed (M-CRITIC-RP) method. An illustrative example to rank performance criteria of display advertisement for a digital marketing campaign is used to demonstrate the method's workability. Comparative analysis with appropriate MCDM methods reveals that the distance correlation values for the weights of the M-CRITIC-RP and comparative methods exhibit higher consistency than those between other criteria ranking methods. Moreover, M-CRITIC-RP has a high average value of Spearman rank statistic, indicating high rank consistency. Regarding accuracy, the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) and the Log Accuracy Ratio (LAR) error metrics show lower values for M-CRITIC-RP in comparison to the corresponding values of other criteria ranking methods. M-CRITIC-RP demonstrates sensitivity with changes in the number of alternatives and also to variations in the RPs. The results of the sensitivity analysis guide the analyst to pay ample attention when selecting the RP. Findings also suggest considering a sufficient sample size for better accuracy and consistency of weights and ranks. Several implications were discussed along with advantages and limitations to be addressed for future work. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Criteria ranking; Criteria weights; CRITIC; Distance correlation; Fuzzy logic; Hamming distance; MCDM; Normalization; Search Ad campaign; Weighting technique,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-fuzzy logic
Intelligent fashion recommender system: Fuzzy logic in personalized garment design,Wang L.C.; Zeng X.Y.; Koehl L.; Chen Y.,2015,10.1109/THMS.2014.2364398,"This paper proposes a new intelligent fashion recommender system to select the most relevant garment design scheme for a specific consumer in order to deliver new personalized garment products. This system integrates emotional fashion themes and human perception on personalized body shapes and professional designers' knowledge. The corresponding perceptual data are systematically collected from professional using sensory evaluation techniques. The perceptual data of consumers and designers are formalized mathematically using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The complex relation between human body measurements and basic sensory descriptors, provided by designers, is modeled using fuzzy decision trees. The fuzzy decision trees constitute an empirical model based on learning data measured and evaluated on a set of representative samples. The complex relation between basic sensory descriptors and fashion themes, given by consumers, is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. The combination of the two models can provide more complete information to the fashion recommender system, making it possible to evaluate if a specific body shape is relevant to a desired emotional fashion theme and which garment design scheme can improve the image of the body shape. The proposed system has been validated in a customized design and mass market selection through the evaluations of target consumers and fashion experts using a method frequently used in marketing study. © 2014 IEEE.",Fuzzy cognitive maps; fuzzy decision trees; fuzzy relations composition; human perception-based fashion recommender system; personalized garment design; sensory evaluation on human body shapes and emotional fashion themes,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,scopus-fuzzy logic

The effect of social media marketing on voting intention; an application of multidimensional panel data,Moslehpour M.; Tiwari A.K.; Ebrahimi Pourfaez S.,2024,10.1108/IJOEM-08-2022-1250,"Purpose: This study examines the effect of social media marketing on voting intention applying a combination of fuzzy logic methodology and a multidimensional panel data model. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a multidimensional panel data method that includes several fixed effects. The dependent variable is a multifaceted construct that measures the participants’ intention to vote. The independent variables are electronic word of mouth (eWOM), customisation (CUS), entertainment (ENT), interaction (INT), trendiness (TRD), candidate’s perceived image (CPI), religious beliefs (RB), gender and age. The grouping variables that signify fixed effects are employment status, level of education, mostly used social media and religion. First, the significance of said fixed effects was tested through an ANOVA process. Then, the main model was estimated, including the significant grouping variables as fixed effects. Findings: Employment status and level of education were significant fixed effects. Also, eWOM, ENT, INT, CPI, RB and gender significantly affected participants’ voting intention. Research limitations/implications: Being based on a questionnaire that asked participants about how they perceive different aspects of social media, the present study is limited to their perceptions. Therefore, further studies covering the voters’ behaviour in action could be efficient complements to the present study. Practical implications: The findings could guide the political parties into prioritizing the aspects of social media in forming an effective campaign resulting in being elected. Social implications: The findings have the potential to help the public in making better informed decisions when voting. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate applications for social media which are beyond leisure time fillers. Originality/value: Fuzzy logic and multidimensional panel data estimates are this study’s novelty and originality. Structural equation modelling and crisp linguistic values have been used in previous studies on social media’s effect on voting intent. The former refines the data gathered from a questionnaire, and the latter considers the possibility of including different grouping factors to achieve a more efficient and less biased estimation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Multidimensional panel data; Political marketing; Public choice; Social media marketing; Voting intention,Emerald Publishing,scopus-fuzzy logic
An intelligent approach to ERP software selection through fuzzy ANP,Ayaǧ Z.; Özdemir R.G.,2007,10.1080/00207540600724849,"During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.",Analytic network process; Enterprise resource planning; Fuzzy logic; Multiple-criteria decision-making; Software selection,,scopus-fuzzy logic

Allocation of marketing budgets to maximize customer equity,Koosha H.; Albadvi A.,2020,10.1007/s12351-017-0356-z,"Relationship marketing considers customers as the main asset of organizations and the source of their profitability. Allocation of marketing budgets to these valuable assets is critical; because the way companies allocate their marketing budgets to customers affects their profitability. The purpose of this research is to provide a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments in a long-term view and a dynamic process. The contribution of the model is as follows: (1) unlike the previous modeling efforts where a predefined budget level was assigned to acquisition and retention, the suggested model sets and allocates marketing budgets simultaneously; (2) the model is multi-period which means the strategies for setting and allocation of marketing budgets may be different in each period. The proposed approach aims at maximizing customer equity in a long-term planning horizon with several periods. Decision variables determine how the budgets should be assigned to customer acquisition and retention in each period. Formulation of the model is followed by a numerical illustration. Since the model is nonlinear and non-convex, none of exact mathematical programming approaches may solve it. Therefore, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing approaches were employed. The results showed the effectiveness of the model compared with other extant models. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Budget allocation; Customer acquisition; Customer equity; Customer retention; Decision calculus; Genetic algorithm; Simulated annealing,Springer,scopus-genetic algorithm
AN APPLICATION OF APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IN MULTI-PERIOD MULTI-PRODUCT ADVERTISING BUDGETING,Khalilzadeh M.; Neghabi H.; Ahadi R.,2023,10.3934/jimo.2021202,"Advertising has always been considered a key part of marketing strategy and played a prominent role in the success or failure of products. This paper investigates a multi-product and multi-period advertising budget allocation, determining the amount of advertising budget for each product through the time horizon. Imperative factors including life cycle stage, BCG matrix class, competitors’ reactions, and budget constraints affect the joint chain of decisions for all products to maximize the total profits. To do so, we define a stochastic sequential resource allocation problem and use an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to alleviate the huge size of the problem and multi-dimensional uncertainties of the environment. These uncertainties are the reactions of competitors based on the current status of the market and our decisions, as well as the stochastic effectiveness (rewards) of the taken action. We apply an approximate value iteration (AV I) algorithm on a numerical example and compare the results with four different policies to highlight our managerial contributions. In the end, the validity of our proposed approach is assessed against a genetic algorithm. To do so, we simplify the environment by fixing the competitor’s reaction and considering a deterministic environment. © 2022,Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization.

Reverse Logistics Network Model of Dual-Channel Recycling Boxes Based on Genetic Algorithm Optimization: A Multi-Objective and Uncertain Environment Perspective,Chen G.; Chen J.,2023,10.3390/su15054408,"In the context of carbon neutrality, plastic ban, and green development, this paper aims to maximize the comprehensive interest of manufacturers in building a sustainable logistic network. It proposes a reverse logistics network model of a dual-channel model with multiple objectives and a random environment for the construction of recycling boxes projects and uses a Stackelberg game to develop pricing strategies for dual-channel recyclers and a genetic algorithm to optimize reverse logistics networks. This paper found the following: multi-objective evaluation is more conducive to sustainable development; when consumers are price-sensitive, a stronger rebate can significantly increase revenue; online platform recyclers should invest more in marketing than traditional recyclers; retailers’ willingness to cooperate in recycling has a significant impact on the overall benefits; the impact of government subsidies is marginal and needs to be controlled to a certain extent; the impact of green credit is insignificant, and the strength of commercial banks’ scrutiny of companies has little effect; an increase in environmental uncertainty within a certain range can lead to an overall loss of benefits, and an excessive impact can be out of line with extreme values. It provides a basis for decision-making on strategies for enterprises to build a logistics network of recycling boxes, government subsidies, green credit from banks, and dual-channel recyclers. © 2023 by the authors.",dual-channel; genetic algorithm; multi-objective; recycling boxes; reverse logistics; Stackelberg game; uncertain environment,MDPI,scopus-genetic algorithm
Joint Optimization of Bus Scheduling and Targeted Bus Exterior Advertising,Hu Z.; Huang D.; Wang S.,2023,10.1061/JTEPBS.TEENG-7812,"Bus exterior advertising provides a powerful way to establish brand awareness because it can reach a mass of audiences with a high frequency. For a certain advertisement category, advertising effectiveness is largely dependent upon its exposure times to the target audience who takes interest in advertisement, which is termed targeted advertising. Given that the distribution of target audiences over a city varies among different advertisement categories, a practical way of enhancing overall advertising effectiveness is to deploy a bus with certain advertisement category to the bus line that best fits its target area. This gives rise to a decision-making problem of targeted bus exterior advertising and bus scheduling. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a biobjective optimization model with objectives of maximizing the quantified advertising effectiveness and minimizing the number of bus fleet size to cover all trips. The advertising effectiveness is quantified using audience demographic data. The deadheading of buses is also enabled in the scheduling process to facilitate both objectives. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-Large Neighborhood Search (NSGA-II-LNS) algorithm is developed to solve the biobjective problem with the incorporation of large neighborhood search operators into the framework of the NSGA-II to improve solution quality.

Optimal payment time and replenishment decisions for retailer’s inventory system under trade credit and carbon emission constraints,Jabbarzadeh A.; Aliabadi L.; Yazdanparast R.,2021,10.1007/s12351-019-00457-5,"This study presents a multi-item inventory and pricing model by considering marketing, service activities, trade credit, carbon emissions, and the restrictions of production cost and storage space. In the proposed model, shortages are allowed and demand rate is a power function of service and marketing costs, and selling price. The main objective of this study is to optimize retailer’s payments time, service and marketing expenditure, and replenishment decisions in order to maximize retailer’s total profit and minimize carbon emissions, simultaneously. Model is developed in a fuzzy environment under carbon tax regulation when the length of credit period provided by supplier is less than or equal to the length of time in which no shortage happens. To solve the proposed model, we first transform the original problem into a multi-objective Signomial Geometric Programming (SGP) problem using fuzzy and hybrid parameters, which minimizes both the mean value and the total dispersion value of the objective function. Then a global optimization problem method has been used to solve the SGP problem. Efficiency of this algorithm is tested and compared with multi-objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective genetic algorithm with varying population, and hybrid heuristic algorithm.

Coordinated optimisation of platform-driven product line planning by bilevel programming,Miao C.; Du G.; Jiao R.J.; Zhang T.,2017,10.1080/00207543.2017.1294770,"Product line planning (PLP) aims at an optimal combination of product feature offerings, suggesting itself to be a determinant decision for a company to satisfy diverse customer needs and gain competitive advantages. Fulfilment of planned product lines must make trade-offs between product variety and production costs. To balance the costs of product lines, manufacturers often adopt a product platform configuration (PPC) approach to redesign product and process platforms by adding new modules to the legacy platforms. The PPC is an effective means of providing product variety while controlling the manufacturing costs. The PLP and PPC problems have traditionally been investigated separately in the marketing research and engineering design fields. It is important to coordinate PLP and PPC decisions within a coherent optimisation framework. This paper proposes a bilevel mixed 0–1 nonlinear programming model to formulate coordinated optimisation for platform-driven product line planning. The upper level deals with the PLP problem by maximising the profit of an entire product line, whilst the lower level copes with the multiple product platforms optimisation for the optimal PPC in accordance with the upper level decisions of product line structure. To solve this bilevel programming model, a bilevel genetic algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution. A case study of coordinated optimisation between an automobile line and its product platforms is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bilevel programming in comparison with a typical ‘all-in-one’ approach and a non-joint optimisation programming. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",bilevel programming; coordinated optimisation; decision-making; design methods; product line; product platform,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-genetic algorithm
The vending machine deployment and shelf display problem: A bi-layer optimization approach,Wang K.-J.; Febri N.,2024,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103581,"The vending machine has become one of the non-store marketing channels to generate sales and give consumers convenient services. However, the logistics decisions in the vending machine service industry are challenging, coupled with complex constraints, considering the machine deployment location, product selection, shelf display allocation, and the elasticity of demands and spaces. This paper presents a bi-layer optimization model addressing the challenges associated with deployment location, product selection, and shelf display for a vending machine system consisting of more than ten thousand vending machines. The upper layer model selects appropriate locations for machine deployment, while the lower layer model considers product selection and shelf display in individual machines. Due to the high complexity of the problem, metaheuristic approaches are developed for seeking near-optimal solutions. The proposed model and algorithms are evaluated using various scales of problems, demonstrating their effectiveness in delivering premium logistics and operational solutions. Additionally, the study explores the impact of product cross and space elasticities.

Exploring the value of IoT data as an enabler of the transformation towards servitization: an action design research approach,Chen K.-L.; Lassen A.; Li C.; Møller C.,2023,10.1080/0960085X.2022.2046515,"Servitization is a well-recognised phenomenon in the manufacturing industry. Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market. © The Operational Research Society 2022.",action design research (ADR); business system; digital servitization; digital transformation; Internet of Things (IoT); resource-based view (RBV),Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-Internet of Things

Social Media Enhances Consumer Behaviour during e-Transactions: An Empirical Evidence from Bahrain,Alshaer D.S.; Hamdan A.; Razzaque A.,2020,10.1142/S0219649220400122,"This study aims to investigate the role of social media on consumer behaviour in the restaurants industry of Bahrain. The objectives of this research were to assess importance of social media as a marketing tool for Bahrain's restaurants for influencing consumer purchase decision-making. Such an objective was reached by the scholars who randomly collected data from 224 respondents in Bahrain, who use social media, using a survey instrument. The findings of the descriptive analysis revealed that social media affects consumers' decision-making, such that the consumers use the social media to study new products, services, and particularly new brands. Also, ongoing consumer discussions reveal how social media exposes the pros and cons of products, services, and brands, so consumers are comfortable with their online decisions, since they can select broads before settling on what is the best price, quality, etc. Moreover, the social media speeds the spread of information unlike any other mass media; ensuring that new knowledge reaches consumers, hence enhancing competition among retailers in the restaurant industry.

We introduce a multi-round advertising bidding mechanism incorporating reputation incentive rules to enhance DSP enthusiasm. The aim is to stimulate DSP participation and deter malicious DSP behavior, ensuring fairness and transparency in the bidding process. Subsequently, we design an auction screening model and adopt a multi-round auction format to ensure that only capable and willing advertising demand partners can participate, thus guaranteeing the reasonableness of DSP bids. Furthermore, we design a real-time bidding mechanism to adapt to the dynamic nature of the IoT marketing market. This mechanism transforms the problem of maximizing DSP revenue under budget constraints into a parameter adjustment problem based on a Markov Decision Process. We then utilize the Double Deep Q Network method to obtain the optimal bidding strategy for DSPs. Ultimately, the results demonstrate that our framework improves the final transaction price by 14.71%, increases the expected click-through rate by an average of 19.35%, and reduces the average cost per thousand impressions by 20.34%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Deep reinforcement learning; IoT marketing; Multi-round auctions; Real-time bidding,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-Internet of Things
Smart cities and 5G networks: An emerging technological area?,Kochetkov D.; Vuković D.; Sadekov N.; Levkiv H.,2019,10.2298/IJGI1903289K,"The term “smart city” has recently become greatly widespread in academic and political discourse. Nevertheless, this is rather a marketing term that unites a number of technological (and other) areas: Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), communication networks. The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research. The results of the study can be used in further theoretical and applied research, in the formation of government policy in research and development, as well as in decision-making in the field of urban management. © 2019, Geographical Institute ""Jovan Cviji"" of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Death of the traditional newspaper: A strategic assessment; [Die dood van die tradisionele koerant:’n Strategiese assessering],LotRiet R.,2018,10.17159/2224-7912/2018/v58n4-1a7,"The newspaper industry in South Africa has been placed under severe pressure with the digital era in recent years. Circulation figures have dropped and profits have decreased. The influence of the Internet and news online could have a significant impact on the manner in which newspaper publishers generate revenue and profits in the future. If the current decrease in circulation continues, there could be as little as 750 000 newspapers in circulation in South Africa by the year 2020. The latest figures still confirm the decline in all classes of newspapers: daily newspapers, pdf replicas, weekly newspapers, weekend and free newspapers. The study shows that one-fifth of SA has partially or completely migrated to online news, which can be the dominant factor for the decrease in circulation rates. The dilemma manifests itself in South Africa’s traditional largest daily newspapers in an increasingly thinning newspaper versus higher than inflationary price increases. The latter culminates in price sensitive readers who respond by purchasing their favourite daily newspaper on selective days only. The Internet of Things in South Africa will grow exponentially as data costs decrease and Internet access improves so that online media usage will grow accordingly. The growing phenomenon of digital media is changing the market landscape significantly and could have dire consequences for the newspaper publisher who does not manage any migration strategically. Is this a case of the famous newspaper cliché: “stop the press!” – especially for Afrikaans daily newspapers? The Internet undermines newspapers’advertising revenues and news became a commodity that could dramatically change the traditional business model. From the contrasting market trends pointed out in the article, it is clear that this complex news ecosystem requires interaction with the readers to pinpoint future consumer journeys. A major challenge is advertisers who now reach larger audiences with digital and broadcast media at a much lower price than those of newspaper advertising. The worrying aspect for the industry is that a loss of advertising revenue in printed newspapers has not been supplemented by an increase in revenue for digital advertising on newspaper websites or online newspapers. Although most newspapers in the world already have an online version, the majority struggle to run it profitably. The news industry is therefore still looking for a sustainable business model. Market structures are constantly changing due to market dynamics. The article indicates that in a fully competitive market, the industry’s demand and supply determine the prevailing market price, and with the concentrated media market in South Africa, several strategies can be followed to win market share. In essence, the South African media industry is oligopolistic in nature. The growing presence of complementary and substitute products in the media industry for printed newspapers has caused significant changes with the ecosystems in terms of the quantity demanded versus changes in demand. Newspaper publishers in the new fragmented media market need to make strategic decisions for sustained growth and improved operational efficiency. In response to the challenges of newspapers, several strategic considerations are proposed – a series of consolidations are already happening in the industry with larger media houses that aggressively acquired smaller competitors. Mergers and acquisitions can provide traction to newspapers and rationalize the number of major players in the industry. The above implies changing business models that are adaptable for strategic considerations to increase subscription and advertising income levels and revenue from other avenues. The strategic options aim to realize greater scale, increasing circulation and income stability. A sustained factor for the printed newspaper is the existing brand value created. Confidence will play a more important role in today’s news landscape with its escalating fake news. The research found that trends in the printed newspaper market have yielded confusing results over the last few years. It represents a world of increasing openness, media diversity and complex choices on both sides of the market. The newspaper industry in South Africa is still navigating through the many variables and hence there is no single optimizing business model. The successful transformation of the printing industry with news as commodity will be driven by relevant research data. The demand for newspapers as a whole is under pressure due to a growing consumer empowerment for other substitutes. Undoubtedly, the industry in South Africa will also increasingly integrate print and digital operations into a hybrid model with the continuous pursuit of critical mass in a multi-channel marketing landscape. For Afrikaans newspapers it implies that the business model going forward needs to be more diversified. The newspaper industry is increasingly becoming a scale business and the overall characteristic is therefore a consolidation phase that strives for optimal mixtures between the various media formats. There is still a viable demand for the printed Afrikaans newspaper, but creative innovation is required to make it sustainable. In the end, it is still market forces that will be the major determinant and, by implication, the Afrikaans reader who is going to drive the quantity demanded. © 2018 South African Academy for Science and the Arts.

Modeling the internet of things adoption barriers in food retail supply chains,Kamble S.S.; Gunasekaran A.; Parekh H.; Joshi S.,2019,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.02.020,"Internet of things (IoT) is estimated to play a significant role in offering tangible and commercial benefits to the supply chains making the operational processes more efficient and productive. IoT system provides the decision-makers with new insights on the value proposition, value creation, helping them to strengthen their bond with the customers and adopt a more effective policy and practices. The food retailing scenario is becoming more complex and flexible putting pressure on the retailing firms to re-design their marketing strategies incorporating the changing consumer behavior. The IoT is expected to help the retailers in controlling the quality of food products, plan waste management of the items that have exceeded their shelf life, manage the temperature at the store, freezers and other equipment's contributing to the reduction of energy consumption. Despite the vast potential of IoT in food retail supply chains, the adoption of IoT is still in its nascent stage. Therefore, this study attempts to identify the various barriers that affect the adoption of IoT in the retail supply chain in the Indian context and also investigates the inter-dependences between the factors using a two-stage integrated ISM and DEMATEL methodology. Lack of government regulations and poor internet infrastructure were identified to be the significant drivers for IoT adoption. © 2019",DEMATEL; Internet of things; ISM; Multi-criteria decision-making technique; Retail supply chain,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-Internet of Things
Utilization of green internet of things (GIoT) applications towards sustainable performance: The antecedents and consequences of carbon footprint,Alalwan A.A.; Baabdullah A.M.; Dwivedi Y.K.; Al-Sulaiti K.I.; Khoualdi K.; Albanna H.,2024,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142956,"This study aims to propose and investigate the key factors that predict the Utilization of Green Internet of Things (U-GIoT) applications by business organizations. This study will also look at the effect of using GIoT applications on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, which in turn, contributes to the sustainable green performance. Therefore, value-belief-norm theory (VBN) was chosen as the theoretical basis for this study's conceptual model. Two constructs derived from VBN (i.e. biospheric value and ecological worldview) are suggested as key predictors for the use of GIoT applications. The conceptual model is extended by considering the role of green marketing orientation (GMO); green energy awareness; and energy knowledge/technical capabilities. The current model also suggests that the utilization of GIoT applications would impact both energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Online questionnaires are used to gather data from a purposive sample (n = 500) of managers and employees at different levels in different service organizations. Statistical results show strong evidence demonstrating the significant effect of biospheric value; ecological worldview; green marketing orientation (GMO); and energy knowledge/technical capabilities with GIoT. This study presents a valuable contribution that helps researchers; policy-makers, and practitioners to identify and understand the most important antecedents and consequences of U-GIoT. It is also worth noting for future studies looking at different applications of pro-environmental behaviour such as sustainable practices, green mobility and transportation, paperless work; recycling; reducing waste levels; and smart green solar. Policy-makers, decision-makers, practitioners and specialists in green energy systems (i.e. GIoT) will be able to use this information for future improvement. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon footprint; Green IoT; Green marketing orientation; Value-belief-norm theory,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-Internet of Things

Women as Industry 4.0. entrepreneurs: unlocking the potential of entrepreneurship in Higher Education in STEM-related fields,Serrano D.R.; Fraguas-Sánchez A.I.; González-Burgos E.; Martín P.; Llorente C.; Lalatsa A.,2023,10.1186/s13731-023-00346-4,"Industry 4.0 is the realization of digital transformation including enhanced productivity and flexibility due to real-time decision-making, which is possible due to the high-speed internet, the internet of things, and smart machines capable of autonomously exchanging information, triggering actions, and controlling each other independently. A high level of education and skills is increasingly more important in the job market over the next years necessitating finding a balance among behavioural, technological, analytical, and entrepreneurial skills. EU and governments worldwide should invest in closing the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education as this will directly impact the economic growth. Even though there is some progress in the hiring percentage of women in large technological companies, a clear glass ceiling in leadership roles is still remains. Here, we have undertaken a pilot study at University Complutense of Madrid (UCM, Spain) aimed at empowering women in academia to transition from the “publish or perish” paradigm towards creating and protecting their intellectual property to close the gender gap in STEM fields and leadership roles as well as training to fuel the development of innovative start-ups addressing societal challenges. A total of 20 participants inclusive of UCM staff and postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers were enrolled after successfully obtaining at least a score of 5 out of 10 in custom-made Entrepreneurial competency test provided by Business and Professional Women Association (BPW, Spain) and theGrowBox Innovation Ltd. The study, approved by the UCM ethical committee, was conducted after participants engaged and completed a training programme on “Enterpreneurship in STEM-related fields in Higher Education” aimed to introduce the participants to the entrepreneurial world. This involved a structured training programme covering the (i) business canvas design; (ii) development of minimum viable product (MVP); (iii) market evaluation; (iv) finance analysis using the Growbox platform; (v) introduction to venture capital; and (vi) human resources management followed by individual mentoring sessions prior completion of their business plans that were pitched to a panel of mentors and BPW representatives. Finally, all participants completed an anonymous survey of 12 open questions to evaluate the impact of the training in awakening the entrepreneurial spirit in academic researchers in Higher Education in STEM-related fields. Three-quarters of participants were novices in terms of Entrepreneurship, but all participants after the programme presented a complete business plan. The three points that women identified as prohibitive factors were lack of self-confidence, ambition, and knowledge in the fields of patent filing, finance and marketing. Participants were likely to initiate their own start-up in the next five years, but had mixed fillings regarding the complexity of the process. Nine months after the course ended, four out of 20 participants have been successful in attracting initial funding to support the initiation of a start-up involving protected intellectual property and managed to secure an award to provide them with office space to build their company. The long-term impact of this training programme will need to be followed up. Entrepreneurial training is crucial to be embedded in curricula for postgraduate and if possible undergraduate students to pursue a major transformation targeting the STEM-related fields in Higher Education to enable women in becoming key participants and leaders in the Industry 4.0 era. © 2023, The Author(s).","Higher Education; Industry 4.0; Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; Women entrepreneurship",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-Internet of Things

Blending Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions into relationship marketing strategies,Lo F.-Y.; Campos N.,2018,10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.029,"With contemporary life becoming more instantly connected and as the disruptiveness of technologies is occurring at a faster pace, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is now even more accessible and common, prompting companies to adopt IoT solutions to improve their customers' experiences. IoT enables physical devices to connect and exchange data through the Internet by collecting strategic information, thus creating opportunities for companies to become more efficient and responsive to market changes. This paper thus investigates how companies are blending IoT solutions into their relationship marketing strategies and focuses on finding how this combination can boost business performance and what the challenges are when dealing with disruptive technology changes. To explore the subject's detailed information and to get a better understanding of managerial decisions concerning IoT, this research conducts in-depth case design analysis from a company's point of view. The data presented herein come from two main sources: open-ended interviews and direct observations, with the interviewees holding high managerial positions in Taiwan's IoT industry. This study aims to contribute to the literature by bringing awareness to the importance of closely following technological trends in combination with relationship marketing strategies and how they help firms remain competitive and profitable. The results of this empirical research shed light on the importance of understanding the impacts of IoT solutions on businesses, especially on clients' behaviors and the development of targeted strategies. The cases herein present similarities on the awareness of the speed of disruptive technologies like IoT, the importance of developing new solutions aligned with new technologies, their impact at creating new business solutions, and their contribution to the development of firm strategies. The findings also show that the application of innovative IoT solutions positively affects the process of developing long and successful relationships through relationship marketing actions. Conversely, concerns related to data security vary according to business segments and relationship marketing pillars such as trust, commitment, and reliability, which could help reduce feelings of ambiguity. This research contributes to filling the gap in the literature by offering a deeper understanding of the correlation between IoT and relationship marketing. Moreover, we illustrate how a combination of these two factors can contribute to the development of stronger marketing strategies, as well as their implications on business. The results of this research suggest further and more comprehensive investigations are needed in the future in order to explore the topic in greater depth and to see how the speed of technology is evolving. © 2018",E-commerce; In-depth case study; Innovation; Internet-of-Things; IoT; Relationship Marketing,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-Internet of Things
"MSME Clusterization Using K-Means Clustering in Garut Regency, Indonesia",Alamanda D.T.; Kusmiati E.; Shiddieq D.F.; Roji F.F.,2022,,"Clusters are groups of activities consisting of core industries, related industries, supporting industries, and supporting and related economic activities, which are interrelated and mutually supportive. This study aims to cluster micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Garut Regency based on their similarity of attributes attached to the factors. These aspects include a taxpayer identification ownership, business license ownership, total net worth, total capital, number of employees, total business volume, product certification, product license, and brand. Clusterization has an important urgency for the development of MSMEs. Clustering can help group MSMEs into groups that are easier to analyze and make the right decisions to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of MSMEs. In addition, the application of clustering for MSMEs can have positive implications such as identifying the characteristics of MSMEs, developing appropriate marketing strategies, improving product or service quality, collaboration and information exchange, and access to resources. This can help MSMEs to increase their efficiency and competitiveness in the market. After data screening, the sample of MSMEs was analyzed using K-means clustering analysis and the help of RapidMiner 5.3 software. There were six iterations conducted before the data position value was stable, with the results revealing three MSME clusters. Cluster 2 had the highest percentage of MSMEs, with 84%. Cluster 1 had a higher percentage of MSMEs with ownership of business license numbers than Clusters 2 and 3. Cluster 3 had a larger and more significant number of MSMEs and a larger total net worth and ownership of product and brand licenses than the other clusters, while Cluster 2 showed an intermediate profile in almost all factors.

A Hybrid Model for China’s Soybean Spot Price Prediction by Integrating CEEMDAN with Fuzzy Entropy Clustering and CNN-GRU-Attention,Liu D.; Tang Z.; Cai Y.,2022,10.3390/su142315522,"China’s soybean spot price has historically been highly volatile due to the combined effects of long-term massive import dependence and intricate policies, as well as inherent environmental elements. The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy. After applying the decomposition part, the results have RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values of 49.59%, 22.58%, and 21.99% lower than those of the individual prediction part, respectively. This research presents a novel approach for market participants in the soybean industry for risk response. It gives a new perspective on agricultural product prices in sustainable agricultural marketing, while also providing practical tools for developing public policies and decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.",CEEMDAN; CNN-GRU-Attention; fuzzy entropy; soybean spot price,MDPI,scopus-k-means
Customers of place: Exploring interregional migrant collectivities,Kadirov D.; Triveni A.,2010,10.1108/17538331011083916,"Purpose – The aim of this research is to explore how and why different migrant groups see different values in places they move to. Understanding these values and also the conditions in which these values are shaped will help in targeting marketing effort. Design/methodology/approach – The hierarchical and K/means cluster analyses were instrumental in identifying different migrant clusters. Planned contrasts were employed to compare related pairs of clusters. The logistic regression analysis identified several determinants of cluster membership likelihood. Findings – Four different internal migrant clusters are identified in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. These are Material Success Seekers, Community/Environment Folks, Apathetics, and All/rounders. The former two express a fragmentalist lifestyle. Material Success Seekers emphasise regional business opportunities while being indifferent to social and natural resources. In contrast, Community/Environment Folks emphasise social and natural resources while maintaining indifference to business opportunities. In turn, the latter two clusters make up a holistic lifestyle: All/rounders consider all three major characteristics of the region to be important while apathetics totally deemphasise these characteristics. The planned contrasts show that demographics are instrumental in predicting differences between related clusters but not helpful in distinguishing the identified lifestyles. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this investigation is that the important constructs used to cluster migrants are not well calibrated, although the reliability scores appear to be satisfactory. Moreover, the use of four/point importance scales does not allow attaining a greater level of construct sensitivity. The research method is unique in a sense that the cluster analysis and the planned contrasts are applied to examine contrasting values of migrant collectivities. Practical implications – A number of specific practical challenges need to be resolved by the regional decision makers in order to enhance place satisfaction by internal migrant collectivities. First, the regional and city councils will need to tailor different services, facilities, and public spaces to appeal to different requirements of migrant clusters. Second, the region's settlement support agency should provide migrants with relevant, focused, and differentiated information about available services and resources to suit their various life goals, aspirations, and values. Originality/value – This investigation tackles the problem of lacking theoretical and empirical research foundation on internal migration as a marketing phenomenon. Moreover, it is unique in its approach of conceptualising migrant segments as cultural phenomena, that is, interdependent collectivities that form on the basis of contrasting values. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Cluster analysis; Immigration; Lifestyles; Market segmentation; Marketing; New Zealand,,scopus-k-means
Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) Environments: Market Segments and Risk,Rockloff M.; Moskovsky N.; Thorne H.; Browne M.; Bryden G.,2017,10.1007/s10899-017-9681-7,"This study used a marketing-research paradigm to explore gamblers’ attraction to EGMs based on different elements of the environment. A select set of environmental features was sourced from a prior study (Thorne et al. in J Gambl Issues 2016b), and a discrete choice experiment was conducted through an online survey. Using the same dataset first described by Rockloff et al. (EGM Environments that contribute to excess consumption and harm, 2015), a sample of 245 EGM gamblers were sourced from clubs in Victoria, Australia, and 7516 gamblers from an Australian national online survey-panel. Participants’ choices amongst sets of hypothetical gambling environments allowed for an estimation of the implied individual-level utilities for each feature (e.g., general sounds, location, etc.). K-means clustering on these utilities identified four unique market segments for EGM gambling, representing four different types of consumers. The segments were named according to their dominant features: Social, Value, High Roller and Internet. We found that the environments orientated towards the Social and Value segments were most conducive to attracting players with relatively few gambling problems, while the High Roller and Internet-focused environments had greater appeal for players with problems and vulnerabilities. This study has generated new insights into the kinds of gambling environments that are most consistent with safe play. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",EGM; Fruit; Pokie; Slot,Springer New York LLC,scopus-k-means

Specifically, this study examines the popularity of several religious sites, the personas of prospective visitors and their intentions to visit. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses several methodological approaches to fulfil its main objective, namely, Google Trends analysis, K-means cluster analysis and linear regression analysis. Findings: The results reveal that several religious sites in the KSA are popular and have potential for further consideration by various stakeholders. In addition, four personas were identified which can aid decision-makers and marketing practitioners in designing suitable plans for prospective visitors based on the participants’ motivation and demographics.

The literature regarding consumer decision-making styles when purchasing digital products is rather scarce. Therefore, a research study on behavioral patterns and product attri-butes important to consumers when they purchase digital goods might contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this type of consumer behavior while also broadening the existing body of knowledge. Design/Methodology/Approach – Empirical data were collected using an online questionnaire consist-ing of items borrowed from the relevant literature and adapted to the research context. Research results are presented using descriptive statistics, exploratory fac-tor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and k-means cluster analysis. Findings and implications – This study has revealed four distinct consumer groups that differ in their consumer decision-making styles when buying digital products. Both theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings are discussed. Results of this research serve as helpful insights into consumer behavior characteristics in a digital products market, providing digital goods companies with valuable inputs for planning their marketing strategies and activities. Limitations – The results of the present research apply to digital products in general. Future research should develop and confirm these initial findings further by incorporating specific digital product categories and fo-cusing on other socio-cultural contexts. Originality – By identifying six consumer decision-mak-ing styles and four distinct clusters, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of consumer approaches when buying digital products, thereby broadening the existing theoretical knowledge of consumer decision-making styles. © 2022, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

Two-stage geomarketing WebGIS solution for a retail location problem; [Webgis de geomarketing: SoluÇÃo de dois estÁgios para um problema de localizaÇÃo do varejo],Salgado R.R.; Libório M.P.; Da Silva Martin C.A.P.; Bernardes P.,2019,10.5380/raega.v46i1.56067,"Market decisions are complex because they involve many data and related criteria in geographic space with different intensities. Geographic information systems (GIS) provide solutions that allow the understanding and understanding of market problems (Geomarketing) and help the decision-making process by allowing the treatment and geographical analysis of these data and criteria. However, GIS involves resources such as people, equipment and maintenance which are not always available. Web-based GIS (WebGIS) can offer the same GIS solutions but require less resources. However, studies show that WebGIS has not been used to its full potential, limited to the geovisualization of points of interest. We propose a Geomarketing WebGIS to solve a classic problem of geographic-market decision. Operated by a two-stage method and spatial analysis (k-means, Voronoi diagram, weighted midpoint, and kernel density function), Geomarketing WebGIS uses potential customer data to show a set of store-branches and the parent-store location. Through simulation, we show that the Geomarketing WebGIS can go beyond the geovisualization and offer solution to a relevant problem of the literature without the restrictions found in the GIS. These findings help to reaffirm that WebGIS: i) has the potential to solve complex geographic problems; ii) have features and resources such as GIS but maintained and operated with fewer resources; and iii) favor the geographic thinking. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Does diversity facilitate consumer decisions: a comparative perspective based on single-category versus multi-category products,Dong X.; Tu H.; Zhu H.; Liu T.; Zhao X.; Xie K.,2024,10.1108/APJML-05-2023-0395,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the opposite effects of single-category versus multi-category products information diversity on consumer decision making. Further, the authors investigate the moderating role of three categories of visitors – direct, hesitant and hedonic – in the relationship between product information diversity and consumer decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilizes a sample of 1,101,062 product click streams from 4,200 consumers. Visitors are clustered using the k-means algorithm. The diversity of information recommendations for single and multi-category products is characterized using granularity and dispersion, respectively. Empirical analysis is conducted to examine their influence on the two-stage decision-making process of heterogeneous online visitors. Findings: The study reveals that the impact of recommended information diversity on consumer decision making differs significantly between single-category and multiple-category products. Specifically, information diversity in single-category products enhances consumers' click and purchase intention, while information diversity in multiple-category products reduces consumers' click and purchase intention. Moreover, based on the analysis of online visiting heterogeneity, hesitant, direct and hedonic features enhance the positive impact of granularity on consumer decision making; while direct features exacerbate the negative impact of dispersion on consumer decision making. Originality/value: First, the article provides support for studies related to information cocoon. Second, the research contributes evidence to support the information overload theory.

Consumer Decision-making Style of Gen Z: A Generational Cohort Analysis,Thangavel P.; Pathak P.; Chandra B.,2022,10.1177/0972150919880128,"The media and consumer research groups have been keeping the Millennials in spotlight for many years now; perhaps it is time to turn some of the attention on Gen Z, which began its foray into mainstream consumption. This exploratory study examines the shopping orientation of Gen Z online shoppers using the generational cohort theory (GCT) as a framework and provides insights to e-retailers to understand how this generation approaches the online shopping. The penetration of Internet and accelerated growth of online shopping have enthused the e-retailers to offer a wide range of goods at greater efficiency than the traditional players. By cluster analysis (K-means) of nine online shopping orientation factors (two were eliminated prior due to low factor loading scores), four segments were identified: (a) ‘Economic-quality seekers’, (b) ‘Convenience shoppers’, (c) ‘Deal hunting-convenience seekers’ and (d) ‘Brand and quality conscious shoppers’, and the study profiled each segment based on the demographic data through chi-square analysis.

Joint selection of variables and clusters: recovering the underlying structure of marketing data,Brudvig S.; Brusco M.J.; Cradit J.D.,2019,10.1057/s41270-018-0045-7,"Clustering observations into groups is perhaps one of the more common marketing analytic techniques. Many variable-selection procedures are available for clustering, and some have exhibited good performance in simulation studies. Unfortunately, the best-performing methods often fail because they emphasize the clustering power of individual variables. For this reason, we recommend extreme caution when using the existing procedures, and we argue that enumeration of all-possible variable subsets is a preferred strategy. We also address a common decision problem—the selection of the number of clusters—and develop an index which can help guide the joint selection of variables and clusters. By way of an empirical example, we illustrate the variable-selection problem and demonstrate the use of the proposed index to jointly select variables and clusters in K-means partitioning. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",K-means clustering; New product launch; Pharmaceutical industry; Segmentation; Variable selection,Palgrave Macmillan,scopus-k-means
Internal branding and sustainability: investigating perceptions of employees,Biedenbach G.; Manzhynski S.,2016,10.1108/JPBM-06-2015-0913,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate perceptual differences between employees characterized by various levels of internal brand commitment and sustainability importance. The identified clusters of employees are compared considering the main determinants of internal brand commitment and their evaluations of a company’s sustainability performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted among employees of industrial companies operating in Belarus. Two hundred thirty-eight responses were analyzed by using the K-means cluster analysis. The analysis of variance was applied for evaluating differences between the three identified clusters. Findings: Based on internal brand commitment and sustainability importance, the paper identifies three alternative clusters of employees: uncommitted sustainability laggards, committed sustainability followers and committed sustainability leaders. The results show that the three clusters differ in regard to the main determinants of internal brand commitment, which are brand orientation, internal brand knowledge and internal brand involvement. The findings demonstrate significant perceptual differences between the three clusters regarding their evaluations of a company’s sustainability performance. The assessment of sustainability performance focuses on sustainability objectives, sustainability policies and sustainability decision-making and disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in the context of a transition economy. Future studies are recommended to develop a cross-cultural comparison of relationships between employees’ perceptions about sustainability performance, different determinants and the outcomes of internal brand commitment.

Analysis of asymmetry factors in the development of the EU tourism industry,Polyakov M.; Bilozubenko V.; Nebaba N.; Korneyev M.; Saihak Y.,2020,10.21511/im.16(4).2020.10,"The effects of the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis call for more active support for the tourism industry. To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism. This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy. The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method - decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies. © This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Asymmetry factors; Country clustering; Marketing strategy; Supranational policy; Tourism,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,scopus-k-means
A driving behavior distribution fitting method based on two-stage hybrid user classification,Su H.; Zhang Q.; Wang W.; Tang X.,2021,10.3390/su13137018,"Determining the distribution fitting of traditional private vehicle user driving behavior is an effective way to understand the differences between different users and provides valuable information on user travel demands. The classification of users is significant to product improvement, precision marketing, and driving recommendations. This study proposed a method which includes four aspects: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing; (3) data analysis—a two-stage hybrid user classification, and (4) distribution fitting method. A two-stage hybrid user classification method is used to cluster traditional vehicle users. First, the first-stage classification of the classification method extracts the daily typical time–mileage-series travel patterns (TMTP) to obtain user driving time characteristics. This first-stage classification also extracts the mean and standard deviation of the daily vehicle mileage traveled (DVMT) to express user driving demands. Next, users are divided by K-means based on the driving time characteristics and driving demands from the first stage. Finally, a three-parameter log-normal distribution is used to fit the DVMT of different user types. Comparison with traditional clustering based on the mean and standard deviation and the proportion of each vehicle’s time series in the TMTP types, this study reveals that the new methods provide significant advantages in analyzing driving behavior and high reference value for enterprises making electric vehicle driving range recommendations, car market segmentation, and policy making decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

Mass customization strategy development by FIRM,Pishdad A.; Taghiyareh F.,2011,10.1057/dbm.2011.37,"Purpose- Nowadays, managers achieve superior performance and greater efficiency by evaluating their firm's readiness for mass customization before committing their company to such a strategy. The purpose of this article is to handle this issue by proposing a managerial framework- named FIRM- for firm profiling, which offers the strategic shift toward mass customization concept. The aim is to provide a tool for executives, which helps them discuss strengths and weaknesses in the internal production and information technology areas before utilizing these policies. Design/methodology/approach- The research procedure consists of measurement scales generation, data gathering, purification phase, firm clustering and profiling. Using Delphi method and brainstorming sessions, a questionnaire is developed, pretested and administered for a firm's profiling in today's marketing and production environment. Findings- A validation test of FIRM is presented and satisfactory levels of Cronbach's α are obtained at the end of the purification process. The results lead us to believe that the five-dimension structure of FIRM may be reduced to a four-dimension construct. Using k-means cluster analysis results, three different groups of firms are founded. We claim that FIRM would help strategic decision-makers to identify the particular policies and configurations necessary for their business. Clear directions on how to manage customization policies for each firm belonging to special cluster is provided.

Assessing hotel readiness to offer local cuisines: a clustering approach,Bondzi-Simpson A.; Ayeh J.K.,2019,10.1108/IJCHM-12-2017-0820,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the organisational readiness of small and medium scaled hotels to serve indigenous local cuisines and to segment the hotel properties for gastronomic tourism campaigning and destination marketing aims. The study also explores how the concept of organisational readiness relates to menu decision makers’ intentions, perceived benefits and organisational characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Organisational readiness was measured by three dimensions (culture, climate and capacity). Data were derived from a survey of primary menu decision makers from 187 hotels in Ghana. Using a combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical (K-means) algorithms, the hotels were clustered into homogenous groups based on the original raw scores of hotel readiness indicators. The resultant cluster solution was then validated and profiled against relevant external variables. Findings: Analyses reveal three clusters which distinguish hotels by the degree of readiness to serve indigenous local dishes. The resultant segments differ by hotel category (star rating) as well as by the job positions and perceptions of primary menu decision makers. Unexpectedly, lower class hotels displayed significantly greater levels of organisational readiness to serve indigenous cuisines than those in the higher class category. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates that organisational readiness is related to perceived benefits and intentions. Among others, the findings advance the understanding of organisational readiness in hotels in the context of menu decision-making. Given the need to embed new practices in a fast-changing hospitality environment, insights drawn could also serve as a basis for future research. Generalisability of empirical findings may be limited by the socio-economic context as well as the study’s focus on small and medium scaled hotels. Practical implications: This paper supports hotel businesses in understanding the concept of organisational readiness and its relation to organisational characteristics and menu decision-making. By highlighting the different clusters of hotels, the findings accentuate the need for destination marketers and gastronomic tourism campaigners to target higher classed hotels and draw attention to the potential benefits of serving indigenous cuisines while addressing latent concerns. The results further underscore the role of organisational culture and the necessity for such campaign activities to be directed towards those with ample influence within the hierarchical structures of hotels. Originality/value: This is an initial attempt to examine the application of the organisational readiness concept to menu decision-making in hotels and to explore the implications for segmentation purposes. Further analysis revealed the critical role of organisational culture on menu decision-making patterns. Thus, the paper applies an important element of organisational development theory to the hotel industry and represents a valuable contribution to the scant literature on indigenous cuisines in hotel food service contexts. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Culinary tourism; Food service; Indigenous dishes; Menus; Organizational readiness; Segmentation,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-k-means

Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained from a survey conducted in Erzurum in 2014. A conjoint analysis was used to determine the utilities of each level along with the relative importance of Erzurum Civil cheese attributes for measuring the consumption satisfaction as an indicator of the purchase decision and priorities of Turkish consumers. Findings – The results of the study clearly highlighted that Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction was maximized with the augmented and actual product images redesigned by a private-labelled and local-branded simple product with the highest and medium prices based on organic production techniques for heavy and light consumers, respectively. However, medium consumers appreciated the core benefit obtained from the credence quality attributes supported by the generic branded simple cheese with the lowest price purchased directly from the farmstead villages. Eventually, these marketing tactics and strategies could increase demand, maximizing the cheese consumption and satisfaction of Turkish consumers in each cluster. They could also provide greater consumption satisfaction to Turkish consumers as well as bigger marginal contributions to the market dynamics of the food supply chain.

Information and source preferences of a student market in higher education,Bonnema J.; Van Der Waldt D.L.R.,2008,10.1108/09513540810875653,"Purpose - Marketing communication practitioners in higher education have not yet identified specific subgroups with similar characteristics within the prospective student (target) market, and do not always know which preferred sources learners consult when deciding on a tertiary institution for further or higher education. In addition, little is known about prospective students' information needs when deciding which institution to attend. As a result many tertiary institutions still use one message in one medium for all target markets. The aims of this paper are: to determine if sub-groups exist within the student recruitment market that need tailor made persuasive messages; to determine the preferred sources of information gathering for prospective students that influences their choice of tertiary institution; and to determine the information needs of prospective students that influence their decisions to select an institution of higher education. Design/methodology/approach - A stratified random sample of 19 schools was drawn, from which a total of 716 successfully completed questionnaires were used to conduct factor and cluster analyses to determine information needs and source preferences of these respondents. Findings - Ten factors under the VARCLUS procedure with high eigen values were grouped together with the following labels: university, college, employability aspects, course content, student experience, sporting aspects, financial aspects, direct sources, media sources and social sources. Five sub-groups clustered together with the K-means analysis, labelled: have lots, aspiring have lots, little direction and new lifers. Research limitations/implications - A limited amount of literature is available on the current use of media and sources by the target market. Decisions on the choice of a tertiary institution for higher education are most probably influenced by socio-economic circumstances in a developing context, like South Africa. Practical implications - An integrated and well co-ordinated media and message strategy for each of the various sub-groups should be specified for an IMC plan to be successful.

Segmenting and Profiling the Chocolate Consumer: An Emerging Market Perspective,Sondhi N.; Chawla D.,2017,10.1080/10454446.2017.1244784,"Psychographic segmentation has found higher merit among marketing scholars and practicing managers in designing effective marketing strategies to target and deliver better—especially for indulgence food such as chocolates. Hence, adopting a mixed method approach, 17 attitudinal statements were generated through focus group discussions and were used to segment a sample of 301 urban chocolate consumers. The survey data was subjected to a K-means cluster analysis, and it revealed the existence of three distinct clusters: the innovative national; the conservative patriot; and the global seeker. Chi-square analysis was conducted to profile the three groups. Though the study was exploratory in nature, the clusters exhibited such distinct buying patterns that the results hold tremendous value not only from an academic perspective but also for chocolate manufacturers and retailers. All three groups were buying chocolates for gifting purpose, while the young innovators liked to buy for self-gifts as well. Point of sales display had maximum impact on their purchase decision.

Category role aided market segmentation approach to convenience store chain category management,Han S.; Ye Y.; Fu X.; Chen Z.,2014,10.1016/j.dss.2013.09.017,"Category management (CM) plays an increasingly important role in retailing management, as it aids retailers to increase their core competitiveness, maximise profits and ensure a good long-term customer relationship. This technique has been successfully applied to diverse large manufacturers and wholesale retailers. However, it remains a challenging task to directly employ the CM technique in convenience store (CVS) chain(s). This is because CVS chains are often distributed in a variety of areas, each store has impulsive consumers, and the traditional market segmentation attributes (e.g. consumer age, salary, and background) are difficult to collect under such circumstances. This makes it impractical to apply one general CM solution to all CVS chains. Hence, it is crucial to segment a market region and then apply customised CM solutions to the corresponding segments. This paper presents an innovative market segmentation model which is driven by category-role (CR), for the first time, to support CM in CVS chains. A new similarity measure (named HCsim()) and an improved weighted fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm (WFKM) are developed in an effort to cluster the CVSs. The usefulness and applicability of this study is illustrated by means of an empirical study to provide marketing strategy decision support. The derived results are also discussed and compared with existing methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Category management; Convenience store chain management; Market segmentation; Strategic decision support,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-k-means

Clothing brand equity measurement method based on social listening; [基于社会化聆听的服装品牌资产度量方法],Wei Y.; Song K.; Zhong Q.,2022,10.3969/j.issn.1001-7003.2022.09.009,Brand equity measurement is the premise and basis for enterprises to formulate brand strategies and to plan marketing activities. The difficulty of measuring brand equity has been a problem that has plagued the industry for many years and needs to be solved due to the many models miscellaneous methods difficulties in unification and insensitivity of brand equity measurement. Brand equity measurement can be operated from finance market and consumer perspectives while marketers often measure brand equity from a consumer perspective as they focus on brand communication and sales issues. Traditional approaches for brand equity measurement mainly utilize consumer surveys a major limitation of which is that the respondents are highly susceptible to the influence of research instruments such as survey design and intention of the researchers. Additionally survey respondents may be unable or unwilling to express the actual hidden opinions. Traditional approaches are also limited for low efficiency in data collection which leads to delayed reporting high cost and insensitive results and therefore they may be difficult to provide timely information for marketing decisions. With the diffusion of social media consumers are provided with a greater ability to express their opinions freely on social networks. Clothing consumers in particular appear highly active on social media largely because clothing products can provide a lot of worthy topics for social conversations. In this background social listening which monitors naturally occurring brand-related consumer conversations on social networks provides an alternative data source for brand equity measurement for clothing brands. To address the problems of slow response time high cost and insensitive results of traditional brand equity measurement methods the research proposes and validates a method of measuring apparel brand equity based on social listening data by taking into account the characteristics of apparel brands. The proposed method applied consumer-based brand equity framework to social listening data which was obtained with web crawling technologies. The research first developed a framework of seven dimensions of brand benefits for clothing brands based on Keller's brand equity theory which involves brand benefits association in brand image. The seven dimensions include expertise quality aesthetics entertainment social identity fashionability and individuality. The research utilized Sina Weibo as the source of social listening data and selected brand N a leading international sports wear brand as the case to illustrate the proposed approach. Using a web crawling technology the research obtained a total of 54 360 consumer conversations of this brand on Sina Weibo for the year of 2021 involving 5 032 samples and 49 328 pieces of full data. Next the research used the keyword extraction algorithm of LDA topic model to process and purify the unstructured social listening data to establish a thesaurus for the brand benefit dimensions. The research repetitively performed the LDA algorithm four times using samples of the full data to ensure the thesaurus was complete and 1 600 pieces of data were extracted. The study concluded that the re-emergence of new words had an impact of less than 1. 41% on the brand interest keyword lexicon indicating that the lexicon was largely saturated. The resulting thesaurus included 28 keywords for the expertise dimension 12 for quality 17 for aesthetics 21 for entertainment 24 for social identity 14 for fashionability and 14 for individuality. Lastly the TF-IDF text similarity algorithm was used to calculate the similarity between the thesaurus of each dimension and the full data of social conversations to achieve the measurement of brand equity for the case brand. Innovation in this research are three folds. First the research designed and validated a new approach to measure clothing brand equity which may overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. Second it established a set of indicators of clothing brand equity which can be used for future research. Third it provided a solution to processing unstructured data in natural languages. The results showed that in 2021 consumers were highly concerned of social identity of the case brand its brand equity was influenced by the Xinjiang Cotton event which created tremendous number of conversations about the brand on social networks. In conclusion brand benefits in brand equity which marketers are highly concerned of can be extracted from social listening data. The proposed approach based on social listening data which are often dynamic may overcome the limitations of traditional methods in cost efficiency granularity and measurement sensitivity. In terms of methodology the keyword extraction algorithms such as LDA can be used to construct thesaurus of brand benefit dimensions and text-similarity algorithms can be used to provide quantitative assessment for the dimensions of brand equity. Previous research has shown that carefully planned efforts in enhancing brand equity can significantly improve marketing effectiveness. Emphasizing brand benefits during online shopping festivals or promotional events for instance can create greater consumer engagement with a brand enhance brand image in the minds of consumers and consequently improve consumers' willingness to buy. In future research the algorithms of the proposed approach can be further optimized by applying more cutting-edge machine learning techniques. For instance the algorithm in extraction of keywords and the accuracy of the algorithm for calculating text similarity have room for improvement to achieve more robust measurement of brand equity. © 2022 China Silk Association.

Estimating Life Cycle Sales of Technology Products with Frequent Repeat Purchases: A Fractional Calculus-Based Approach,Lotfi A.; Jiang Z.; Lotfi A.; Jain D.C.,2023,10.1287/isre.2022.1131,"Accurately predicting the sales trajectory of a product in its life cycle is critically important for firms’ medium- and long-term planning. Because classic product-diffusion models such as the Bass model consider only initial product purchases, they are ill-fitted for sales prediction for today’s technology products with a shorter life cycle and frequent repeat purchases or subscription renewals. Despite the long tradition of product diffusion research, there exists no viable model option when repeat purchases constitute a large proportion of product sales. The present study introduces a new sales growth model, termed the generalized diffusion model with repeat purchases (GDMR), to fill this void. The GDMR formulates the growth rate of sales using a noninteger-order integral equation rather than the integer-order differential equation typically adopted in existing diffusion models. The GDMR is parsimonious and easy to implement. Empirical results show that the GDMR fits sales data with varying proportions of repeat purchases quite well, making it suitable for predicting sales of a wide variety of products. In addition, the GDMR can be extended to incorporate marketing mix variables, thus enhancing its applicability in business decision making. Furthermore, using both real and simulated data, we show that the GDMR can reliably recover a product’s adoption trend using only sales data, thus cementing its theoretical validity and empirical effectiveness. Finally, we show that the GDMR is superior to generic time series and machine learning models in predicting future product sales. 2022 INFORMS.",diffusion of innovations; fractional calculus; multiunit ownerships; repeat purchases; replacements,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-machine learning
Can reviews predict reviewers’ numerical ratings? The underlying mechanisms of customers’ decisions to rate products using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),Poushneh A.; Rajabi R.,2022,10.1108/JCM-09-2020-4114,"Purpose: Two valuable pieces of information – reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings – are accessible to potential customers before they make a purchasing decision. An extensive body of marketing literature has scrutinized the influence of customers’ reviews by linking such aspects as the volume and valance of reviews with product sales and customers’ purchase intention. The aim of this study, for which dual coding theory was used, was to understand the relationship between reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the latent Dirichlet allocation technique to categorize customers’ reviews. The present findings contribute to the literature by showing the underlying mechanisms that customers use to interpret reviews and associate them with numerical ratings. Findings: The gradient boosted decision tree model demonstrates that non-abstract-dominant reviews (reviews mainly consist of tangible objects, actions, events or affective words) are significant predictors of their corresponding numerical ratings. However, abstract-dominant reviews (i.e. those consisting primarily of intangible objects, events or actions) cannot predict their associated numerical ratings. Originality/value: The present findings contribute to the literature by showing the underlying mechanisms that customers use to interpret reviews and associate them with numerical ratings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Customer review; Dual coding theory; Gradient boosted decision tree; LDA; Machine learning; Online customer review; Online text reviews; Topic modeling,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-machine learning
Exploring the Impact of Time Spent Reading Product Information on E-Commerce Websites: A Machine Learning Approach to Analyze Consumer Behavior,Necula S.-C.,2023,10.3390/bs13060439,"In this study, we aim to investigate the influence of the time spent reading product information on consumer behavior in e-commerce. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing importance of understanding online consumer behavior, our research focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of customer navigation on e-commerce websites and its effects on purchasing decisions. Recognizing the multidimensional and dynamic nature of consumer behavior, we utilize machine learning techniques, which offer the capacity to handle complex data structures and reveal hidden patterns within the data, thereby augmenting our comprehension of underlying consumer behavior mechanisms. By analyzing clickstream data using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we provide new insights into the internal structure of customer clusters and propose a methodology for analyzing non-linear relationships in datasets. Our results reveal that the time spent reading product-related information, combined with other factors such as bounce rates, exit rates, and customer type, significantly influences a customer’s purchasing decision. This study contributes to the existing literature on e-commerce research and offers practical implications for e-commerce website design and marketing strategies. © 2023 by the author.",clickstream data; clustering; e-commerce; Machine Learning; Principal Component Analysis,MDPI,scopus-machine learning
What are tenants demanding the most? A machine learning approach for the prediction of time on market,Cajias M.; Freudenreich A.,2024,10.1108/JPIF-09-2023-0083,"Purpose: This is the first article to apply a machine learning approach to the analysis of time on market on real estate markets. Design/methodology/approach: The random survival forest approach is introduced to the real estate market. The most important predictors of time on market are revealed and it is analyzed how the survival probability of residential rental apartments responds to these major characteristics. Findings: Results show that price, living area, construction year, year of listing and the distances to the next hairdresser, bakery and city center have the greatest impact on the marketing time of residential apartments. The time on market for an apartment in Munich is lowest at a price of 750 € per month, an area of 60 m2, built in 1985 and is in a range of 200–400 meters from the important amenities. Practical implications: The findings might be interesting for private and institutional investors to derive real estate investment decisions and implications for portfolio management strategies and ultimately to minimize cash-flow failure. Originality/value: Although machine learning algorithms have been applied frequently on the real estate market for the analysis of prices, its application for examining time on market is completely novel.

Predictions on usefulness and popularity of online reviews: evidence from mobile phones for older adults,Shou M.; Bao X.; Yu J.,2023,10.1108/ITP-12-2021-0930,"Purpose: Online reviews are regarded as a source of information for decision-making because of the abundance and ready availability of information. Whereas, the sheer volume of online reviews makes it hard for consumers, especially the older adults who perceive more difficulties in reading reviews and obtaining information compared to younger adults, to locate the useful ones. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective method to locate valuable reviews of mobile phones for older adults. Besides, the authors also want to explore what characteristics of the technology older adults prefer. This will benefit both e-retailers and e-commerce platforms. Design/methodology/approach: After collecting online reviews related to mobile phones designed for older adults from a popular Chinese e-commerce platform (JD Mall), topic modeling, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) methods were applied to extract latent topics and uncover potential dimensions that consumers frequently referred to in their reviews. According to consumers' attitudes towards different popular topics, seven machine learning models were employed to predict the usefulness and popularity of online reviews due to their excellent performance in prediction. To improve the performance, a weighted model based on the two best-performing models was built and evaluated. Findings: Based on the TF-IDF, topic modeling, and LIWC methods, the authors find that older adults are more interested in the exterior, sound, and communication functions of mobile phones. Besides, the weighted model (Random Forest: Decision Tree = 2:1) is the best model for predicting the online review popularity, while random forest performs best in predicting the perceived usefulness of online reviews. Practical implications: This study’s findings can help e-commerce platforms and merchants identify the needs of the targeted consumers, predict reviews that will get more attention, and provide some early responses to some questions. Originality/value: The results propose that older adults pay more attention to the mobile phones' exterior, sound, and communication function, guiding future research. Besides, this paper also enriches the current studies related to making predictions based on the information contained in the online reviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",E-marketing; Information management; Information society; Online shopping; Quantitative method; Text analysis,Emerald Publishing,scopus-machine learning

Dynamic Marketing Resource Allocation with Two-Stage Decisions,Zhang S.; Liao P.; Ye H.-Q.; Zhou Z.,2022,10.3390/jtaer17010017,"In the precision marketing of a new product, it is a challenge to allocate limited resources to the target customer groups with different characteristics. We presented a framework using the distance-based algorithm, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine to capture customers’ preferences toward promotion channels. Additionally, online learning programming was combined with machine learning strategies to fit a dynamic environment, evaluating its performance through a parsimonious model of minimum regret. A resource optimization model was proposed using classification results as input. In particular, we collected data from an institution that provides financial credit products to capital-constrained small businesses. Our sample contained 525,919 customers who will be introduced to a new product. By simulating different scenarios between resources and demand, we showed an up to 22.42% increase in the number of expected borrowers when KNN was performed with an optimal resource allocation strategy. Our results also show that KNN is the most stable method to perform classification and that the distance-based algorithm has the most efficient adoption with online learning. © 2022 by the authors.

More than a Feeling: Accuracy and Application of Sentiment Analysis,Hartmann J.; Heitmann M.; Siebert C.; Schamp C.,2023,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.05.005,"Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon. © 2022 The Authors",Deep Contextual Language Models; Machine Learning; Meta-Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Transfer Learning,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-machine learning
Analyzing browsing across websites by machine learning methods,Falke A.; Hruschka H.,2022,10.1007/s11573-021-01067-4,"The increasing importance of online distribution channels is paralleled by a rising interest in gaining insights into the customer journey and browsing behavior. We evaluate several machine learning methods (latent Dirichlet allocation, correlated topic model, structural topic model, replicated softmax model) with respect to their ability to reproduce the browsing behavior of households across websites. In addition, we compare these machine learning methods to a related classical technique, singular value decomposition. In our study, the replicated softmax model outperforms latent Dirichlet allocation, but the correlated topic model attains the overall best performance. Compared to singular value decomposition both the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model lead to a more efficient compression of web browsing data. On the other hand, singular value decomposition surpasses latent Dirichlet allocation. We interpret results of the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model by determining combinations of topics or hidden variables that are heterogeneous with respect to visited websites. We show that decision makers should not rely on bivariate measures of site visits, as these do not agree with measures of interdependences between sites that can be inferred from the correlated topic model or the replicated softmax model. We investigate how well topics or hidden variables measured by these methods predict yearly household expenditures. The correlated topic model leads to the best predictive performance, followed by the replicated softmax model. We also discuss how the replicated softmax model can be used to support online marketing decisions of websites. © 2021, The Author(s).",Machine learning; Online marketing; Restricted Boltzmann machine; Topic models; Web browsing,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-machine learning

Toward a new approach to author profiling based on the extraction of statistical features,Ouni S.; Fkih F.; Omri M.N.,2021,10.1007/s13278-021-00768-6,"Recently, author profiling on social media and on online platforms, characterized by a huge volumes of data, has become more than a critical issue. This issue is of increasing interest in various fields related to forensic medicine, security, marketing, education, etc. The main objective of author profiling is to identify the type of writer of the messages, whether it is a human or a bot with a very strong presence. These bots have the task of drawing the attention of browsers to specific events, often used to disseminate incorrect and/or false information. In this work, we offer a new approach to detect these bots and the kind of anonymous perpetrators on these social networks. Our approach, purely statistical, is based on digital features (APSF), extracted from users’ tweets, and on the technique of random forests. A total of 17 stylometry-based features were used to train the model. To assess the performance of our approach, we considered different standard measures, namely accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

The Factors Influencing Older Adults’ Decisions Surrounding Adoption of Technology: Quantitative Experimental Study,Moxley J.; Sharit J.; Czaja S.J.,2022,10.2196/39890,"Background: The rapid diffusion of technology apps may support older adults’ independence and improve the quality of their lives. Models for predicting technology acceptance in older adults are sparse, based on broad questions related to general technology acceptance, and largely not grounded in theories of aging. Objective: This study aimed to use a mixed methods approach involving 5 technologies to comprehensively assess the causal relationships among factors that influence older adults’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Methods: In total, 187 men and women aged 65 to 92 years participated in the study. Participants were given presentations on 5 different technologies spanning domains that included transportation, leisure, health, and new learning and provided ratings of each technology on various measures hypothesized to influence adoption. They were also administered other instruments to collect data on their actual and self-assessed cognitive abilities, rates of discounting of the technologies with respect to willingness to invest time to attain higher skills in the technologies, general technology experience, and attitudes toward technology. We used the machine learning technique of k-fold cross-validated regressions to select variables that predicted participants’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Results: Willingness to adopt technologies was most impacted by 3 variables: perceived value of the technologies (β=.54), perceived improvement in quality of life attainable from the technologies (β=.24), and confidence in being able to use the technologies (β=.15). These variables, in turn, were mostly facilitated or inhibited by the perceived effort required to learn to use the technologies, a positive attitude toward technology as reflected in the optimism component of the technology readiness scale, the degree to which technologies were discounted, and the perceived help needed to learn to use the technologies. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that participants’ willingness to adopt technologies is mainly determined by perceptions of 3 aspects of the technologies; these aspects possibly mediate many relationships with willingness to adopt. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design and marketing of technology products for older consumers. ©Jerad Moxley, Joseph Sharit, Sara J Czaja.",adopt; adoption; aging; application; cognition; cognitive; consumer; design; design; health; independence; learning; leisure; marketing; mobile phone; older adult; relationship; technology; technology; transportation; willingness,JMIR Publications Inc.,scopus-machine learning
"""give Everybody [..] a Little Bit More Equity"": Content Creator Perspectives and Responses to the Algorithmic Demonetization of Content Associated with Disadvantaged Groups",Kingsley S.; Sinha P.; Wang C.; Eslami M.; Hong J.I.,2022,10.1145/3555149,"Algorithmic systems help manage the governance of digital platforms featuring user-generated content, including how money is distributed to creators from the profits a platform earns from advertising on this content. However, creators producing content about disadvantaged populations have reported that these kinds of systems are biased, having associated their content with prohibited or unsafe content, leading to what creators believed were error-prone decisions to demonetize their videos. Motivated by these reports, we present the results of 20 interviews with YouTube creators and a content analysis of videos, tweets, and news about demonetization cases to understand YouTubers' perceptions of demonetization affecting videos featuring disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, as well as creator responses to demonetization, and what kinds of tools and infrastructure support they desired. We found creators had concerns about YouTube's algorithmic system stereotyping content featuring vulnerable demographics in harmful ways, for example by labeling it ""unsafe'' for children or families - creators believed these demonetization errors led to a range of economic, social, and personal harms. To provide more context to these findings, we analyzed and report on the technique a few creators used to audit YouTube's algorithms to learn what could cause the demonetization of videos featuring LGBTQ people, culture and/or social issues. In response to the varying beliefs about the causes and harms of demonetization errors, we found our interviewees wanted more reliable information and statistics about demonetization cases and errors, more control over their content and advertising, and better economic security.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",algorithm auditing; algorithmic systems; algorithms; bias; content creators; creative economy; demonetization; discrimination; economic opportunity; fair pay; future of work; LGBTQ; machine learning systems.; marginalized communities; monetization; precarious work; user auditing; YouTube,Association for Computing Machinery,scopus-machine learning
Machine Learning and Hybrid Model Building Mechanism for Forecasting Agricultural Market Behaviour: A Case Study of Vegetable Crops,Shobharani H.M.; Gupta A.K.; Kumar S.; Tripathi G.,2024,10.35716/IJED-24008,"A strategic market intelligence mechanism is essential for stakeholders to make well-informed decisions on production, pricing, and marketing strategies; however, the complex behaviour of agricultural markets, coupled with the presence of non-stationarity, non-normality, and non-linearity in the arrivals and prices of perishable agricultural commodities pose challenges for traditional statistical models in modelling and forecasting. This study sought to overcome these challenges by employing machine learning and hybrid models for vegetable crops. Machine learning techniques, known for their flexibility with non-stationary, non-normal, and non-linear data, were showcased in the empirical illustration, highlighting their effectiveness.

At the first stage, distrust among the unbanked and banked was estimated using a Boruta-random forest algorithm. At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis. Findings: Results from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked. Research limitations/implications: This study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field. Originality/value: The paper provides a discussion about ways domains of trust and specific variables can be utilized to address the persistent problem of financial exclusion in the United States. Implications for bankers, researchers, educators and policymakers are provided. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer trust; Distrust; Financial exclusion; Financial inclusion; Household banking; Unbanked,Emerald Publishing,scopus-machine learning
Innovation and Technological Management Model in the Tequila Sector in Mexico,Terán-Bustamante A.; Martínez-Velasco A.; Castillo-Girón V.M.; Ayala-Ramírez S.,2022,10.3390/su14127450,"Creativity, ideas, and an entrepreneurial attitude are needed to innovate. However, it is also necessary to have practical instruments that allow innovations to be reflected in the company. One of those tools is technology. This research aims to analyze innovation and technology in the tequila industry through Bayesian networks with machine learning techniques. Likewise, an innovation and technology management model will be developed to make better decisions, which will allow the company to innovate to generate competitive advantages in a mature low-tech industry. A model is made in which the critical factors that influence management innovation and technology optimally to generate value translate into competitive advantages. The evidence shows that the optimal or non-optimal management of knowledge management and its various factors, through the causality of the variables, allow the interrelation to be more adequately captured to manage it. The results show that the most relevant factors for adequate management of innovation and technology are knowledge management, sales and marketing, organizational and technological architecture, national and international markets, cultivation of raw materials, agave, and management, use of waste, and not research and development. © 2022 by the authors.

Are longer reviews always more helpful? Disentangling the interplay between review length and line of argumentation,Lutz B.; Pröllochs N.; Neumann D.,2022,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.02.010,"An overwhelming majority of previous works find longer product reviews to be more helpful than short reviews. In this paper, we build upon information overload theory and propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the complexity of the line of argumentation. To test this idea, we implement state-of-the-art machine learning methods that allow us to study the line of argumentation in reviews at the sentence-level. Our empirical analysis based on a dataset of Amazon customer reviews suggests that line of argumentation and review length are closely intertwined such that longer reviews with frequent changes between positive and negative arguments are perceived as less helpful. Our work has important implications for marketing professionals and retailer platforms that can utilize our results to optimize their customer feedback systems, enhance reviewer guidelines, and include more useful product reviews. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Argumentation patterns; Consumer reviews; Data-driven decision-making; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Online word-of-mouth,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-machine learning
Beyond the beaten paths of forecasting call center arrivals: on the use of dynamic harmonic regression with predictor variables,Rausch T.M.; Albrecht T.; Baier D.,2022,10.1007/s11573-021-01075-4,"Modern call centers require precise forecasts of call and e-mail arrivals to optimize staffing decisions and to ensure high customer satisfaction through short waiting times and the availability of qualified agents. In the dynamic environment of multi-channel customer contact, organizational decision-makers often rely on robust but simplistic forecasting methods. Although forecasting literature indicates that incorporating additional information into time series predictions adds value by improving model performance, extant research in the call center domain barely considers the potential of sophisticated multivariate models. Hence, with an extended dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) approach, this study proposes a new reliable method for call center arrivals’ forecasting that is able to capture the dynamics of a time series and to include contextual information in form of predictor variables. The study evaluates the predictive potential of the approach on the call and e-mail arrival series of a leading German online retailer comprising 174 weeks of data. The analysis involves time series cross-validation with an expanding rolling window over 52 weeks and comprises established time series as well as machine learning models as benchmarks. The multivariate DHR model outperforms the compared models with regard to forecast accuracy for a broad spectrum of lead times. This study further gives contextual insights into the selection and optimal implementation of marketing-relevant predictor variables such as catalog releases, mail as well as postal reminders, or billing cycles. © 2021, The Author(s).",Call center arrivals; Customer relationship management; Dynamic harmonic regression; Forecasting; Machine learning; Time series analysis,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-machine learning
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING NOVEL DEEP LEARNING METHODS,Kumar N.; Agarwal P.; Bansal S.; Yadav V.K.; Bhowmik D.,2024,10.24874/PES06.02A.012,"In the current digital era, the humongous amount of data being generated has been impacting public lives in one or the other ways. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is related to contextual mining of texts which helps in identification and extraction of subjective information from the source material. Sentiment analysis is being used for brand monitoring and reputation management across different market segments. It helps to understand how the public perceive a particular brand, product or service that is highly useful for different tech companies, marketing agencies, media organizations, fashion brands etc. In today’s scenario we have been suffering with data overload which makes it impossible to analyze public sentiments without any sort of error or bias. Sentiment analysis provides better insights into the public reviews as it can be automated which ultimately helps in decision making. There are various deep learning and machine learning methods and models as well as natural language processing tools which help in examining and analyzing public opinions with low time complexity. However, deep learning methods have become highly popular in recent times as these models provide high efficiency and accuracy. In this review paper we have provided a complete overview of the common deep learning frameworks being employed for sentiment classification and analysis. This paper discusses various learning models, evaluation, text representations and other metrics in deep learning architectures. The key findings of different authors have been discussed in detail.

COVID-19 vaccine rejection causes based on Twitter people’s opinions analysis using deep learning,Alotaibi W.; Alomary F.; Mokni R.,2023,10.1007/s13278-023-01059-y,"According to the World Health Organization, vaccine hesitancy was one of the ten major threats to global health in 2019, including the COVID-19 vaccine. The availability of vaccines does not always mean utilization. This is because, people have less confidence in vaccines, which resulted in vaccination hesitancy and developing global decline in vaccine intake and has caused viral disease outbreaks worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to understand people’s perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine to help the manufacturing companies of the vaccine to improve their marketing strategy based on the rejection causes. In this paper, we used multi-class Sentiment Analysis to classify people’s opinions from extracted tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, using firstly different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and secondly various Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNN-LSTM and RNN-GRU. Then, we investigated the analysis of the negative tweets to identify the causes of rejection using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Finally, we classified these negative tweets according to the rejection causes for all the vaccines using the same selected ML and DL models. The result of SA showed that DT gives the best performance with an accuracy of 92.26% and for DL models, GRU achieved 96.83%. Then, we identified five causes: Lack of safety, Side effect, Production problem, Fake news and Misinformation, and Cost. Furthermore, for the classification of the negative tweets according to the identified rejection causes, the LR achieved the best result with an accuracy of 89.97%. For DL models, the LSTM model showed the best result with an accuracy of 91.66%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19 vaccines; Deep learning; GRU-LSTM; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine rejection causes,Springer,scopus-machine learning
Visual Explanations of Differentiable Greedy Model Predictions on the Influence Maximization Problem,Michelessa M.; Hurter C.; Lim B.Y.; Ling J.N.S.; Cautis B.; Hargreaves C.A.,2023,10.3390/bdcc7030149,"Social networks have become important objects of study in recent years. Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.",decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-machine learning
Exploring Influential Factors with Structural Equation Modeling–Artificial Neural Network to Involve Medicine Users in Home Medicine Waste Management and Preventing Pharmacopollution,Silva W.D.O.; Morais D.C.; da Silva K.G.; Carmona Marques P.,2023,10.3390/su151410898,"The appropriate management of home medical waste is of paramount importance due to the adverse consequences that arise from improper handling. Incorrect disposal practices can lead to pharmacopollution, which poses significant risks to environmental integrity and human well-being. Involving medicine users in waste management empowers them to take responsibility for their waste and make informed decisions to safeguard the environment and public health. The objective of this research was to contribute to the prevention of pharmacopollution by identifying influential factors that promote responsible disposal practices among medicine users. Factors such as attitude, marketing campaigns, collection points, safe handling, medical prescription, package contents, and public policies and laws were examined. To analyze the complex relationships and interactions among these factors, a dual-staged approach was employed, utilizing advanced statistical modeling techniques and deep learning artificial neural network algorithms. Data were collected from 952 respondents in Pernambuco, a state in northeastern Brazil known for high rates of pharmacopollution resulting from improper disposal of household medical waste. The results of the study indicated that the propositions related to safety in handling and medical prescription were statistically rejected in the structural equation modeling (SEM) model. However, in the artificial neural network (ANN) model, these two propositions were found to be important predictors of cooperative behavior, highlighting the ANN’s ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between variables. The findings emphasize the significance of user cooperation and provide insights for the development of effective strategies and policies to address pharmacopollution. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial neural network; consumer behavior; deep learning; home waste medicine; pharmacopollution; structural equation modeling,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-machine learning

The usefulness of socio-demographic variables in predicting purchase decisions: Evidence from machine learning procedures,Islam T.; Meade N.; Carson R.T.; Louviere J.J.; Wang J.,2022,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.07.004,"Research has long debated the effectiveness of socio-demographics in understanding purchase behavior, with mixed conclusions. The appeal of socio-demographic data for customer relationship marketing is based on its low acquisition cost and the growing array of variables on which marketers can condition messages and offers. We reinvestigate the value of socio-demographic variables, focusing on the potential of machine learning procedures (MLPs) to extract a stronger and reliable signal than the standard linear-in-parameters (logistic) regression models. We explore how predictive power can be increased through the nonlinearities and interactions identified with MLPs; our experimental set ranges from well-established procedures to newer entrants in this space. We also examine causality vis-à-vis predictability using a propensity scoring approach. Empirics are based on six grocery product categories and more than 7,000 panelists. We find that, relative to logistic regression models, MLPs using demographic variables yield a 20% to 33% improvement in out-of-sample predictive accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Buy–no buy; Consumer targeting; Machine learning; Propensity score; Socio-demographic variables,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-machine learning
Network-aware credit scoring system for telecom subscribers using machine learning and network analysis,Gao H.; Liu H.; Ma H.; Ye C.; Zhan M.,2022,10.1108/APJML-12-2020-0872,"Purpose: A good decision support system for credit scoring enables telecom operators to measure the subscribers' creditworthiness in a fine-grained manner. This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Credit scoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power-law distribution; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-machine learning
Estimation of technical efficiency of chemical-free farming using data envelopment analysis and machine learning: evidence from India,Paul U.K.,2024,10.1108/BIJ-08-2021-0494,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the technical efficiency of the chemical-free farming system in India using a hybrid combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the efficiency scores of decision-making units’ efficiency (DMUs) are obtained using an input-oriented DEA model under the assumption of a variable return to scale. Based on these scores, the DMUs are classified into efficient and inefficient categories. The 2nd stage of analysis involves the identification of the most important predictors of efficiency using a random forest model and a generalized logistic regression model. Findings: The results show that by using their resources efficiently, growers can reduce their inputs by 34 percent without affecting the output. Orchard's size, the proportion of land, grower's age, orchard's age and family labor are the most important determinants of efficiency. Besides, growers' main occupation and footfall of intermediaries at the farm gate also demonstrate significant influence on efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The study used only one output and a limited set of input variables. Incorporating additional variables or dimensions like fertility of the land, climatic conditions, altitude of the land, output quality (size/taste/appearance) and per acre profitability could yield more robust results. Although pineapple is cultivated in all eight northeastern states, the data for the study has been collected from only two states. The production and marketing practices followed by the growers in the remaining six northeastern states and other parts of the country might be different. As the growers do not maintain farm records, their data might suffer from selective retrieval bias. Practical implications: Given the rising demand for organic food, improving the efficiency of chemical-free growers will be a win-win situation for both growers and consumers. The results will aid policymakers in bringing necessary interventions to make chemical-free farming more remunerative for the growers. The business managers can act as a bridge to connect these remote growers with the market by sharing customer feedback and global best practices. Social implications: Although many developments have happened to the DEA technique, the present study used a traditional form of DEA. Therefore, future research should combine ML techniques with more advanced versions like bootstrap and fuzzy DEA. Upcoming research should include more input and output variables to predict the efficiency of the chemical-free farming system. For instance, environmental variables, like climatic conditions, degree of competition, government support and consumers' attitude towards chemical-free food, can be examined along with farm and grower-specific variables. Future studies should also incorporate chemical-free growers from a wider geographic area. Lastly, future studies can also undertake a longitudinal estimation of efficiency and its determinants for the chemical-free farming system. Originality/value: No prior study has used a hybrid framework to examine the performance of a chemical-free farming system. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Chemical-free farming; Data envelopment analysis; Machine learning; Technical efficiency,Emerald Publishing,scopus-machine learning
The influence of human elements in photographs on tourists' destination perceptions and intentions,Zhang K.; Zhang J.; Yang J.,2023,10.1016/j.tourman.2022.104684,"Photographs with a human element are powerful in influencing viewers' perceptions and decision-making processes. However, rare quantitative evidence was detected about the best human presenting percentage and how it affects the intention. In this study, we decoded how human elements (presence or absence, low or high proportion) affect viewers' perceptions and intentions in nature/culture-based photographs. Innovatively, three deep learning models and two experiments were integrated. The results indicate that (1) in general, maintaining the proportion of human elements at less than 1% leads to the best positive perception, and (2) the viewers demonstrate different perceptions and intentions in viewing nature-based and culture-based photographs with the human element. Theoretically, we bring a new perspective and approach to understanding the marketing value of human elements in tourist-generated photographs. Practically, we provide specific and different clues in choosing photographs to promote cultural and natural destinations regarding human elements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Behavioral intentions; Deep learning model; Destination perception; Human elements; Tourist-generated photographs,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-machine learning
Understanding Consumer Perceptions About Smartwatches: Feature Extraction and Opinion Mining Using Supervised Learning Algorithm,Manayath D.; Kaladharan S.; Soman N.V.; Vijayakumaran A.,2024,10.18267/j.aip.231,"Against the backdrop of increasing smartwatch usage and the dynamic landscape of evolving features, a nuanced understanding of consumer opinions and preferences is vital for tailoring features and crafting effective marketing strategies. This study addresses this imperative by conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews on smartwatches, aiming to determine the pivotal factors guiding consumer purchasing decisions. By employing word clouds to visually represent sentiments, the study uncovers notable trends. Positive reviews prominently highlight the term “quality”, suggesting a strong emphasis on product excellence. In contrast, negative reviews were characterized by the prevalence of the term “fake”, indicating concerns related to authenticity. Additionally, a comparative assessment of two machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines and Naive Bayes, demonstrates that support vector machines exhibit superior accuracy in classification. These findings offer valuable insights for industry practitioners navigating the competitive landscape of the smartwatch market, providing actionable information for optimizing product features and refining marketing strategies to meet consumer expectations. © 2024 by the author(s).

Estimating Marketing Component Effects: Double Machine Learning from Targeted Digital Promotions,"Ellickson P.B.; Kar W.; Reeder J.C., III",2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1401,"We estimate the causal effects of different targeted email promotions on the opening and purchase decisions of the consumerswho receive them. To do so,we synthesize and extend recent advances in causal machine learning techniques to capture heterogeneity in the content of the email subject line itself as well as heterogeneous consumer responses to the promotional offers and semantic choices contained therein. We find that content and framing are important for driving performance. We identify precise causal estimates of the effects of individual deal components, personalized content, and various semantic choices on consumer outcomes all theway down the conversion funnel. The decompositional nature of our methodology allows us to show how different combinations of key words and promotional inducements produce significantly different outcomes, both within a given stage and across all stages of the funnel. Notably, discounts framed as clearance events sharply outperform those tied to particular products. We also find components that drive engagement at the top of the funnel don’t always lead to conversion at the bottom: their efficacy, across the funnel, is significantly moderated by the engagement levels of the consumers who receive them. Finally, leveraging both aspects of heterogeneity,we use off-policy evaluation to demonstrate the potential for significant gains fromimproved targeting. © 2023, INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This paper develops realist evaluation methods to explain under which conditions four European DMMOs adopt a relevant group of indicators (acquisition), to provide meaning to these indicators (assimilation), which creates the conditions to make indicator-informed decisions (transformation) that can eventually generate benefits attributable to the use of indicators (exploitation). The methodological novelty of this paper is the use of outcome mapping to systematically outline the process of data collection and analysis to reach the context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining the factors that facilitate or impede the absorptive capacity in these DMMOs. Interventions to increase the uptake of sustainability indicators need to create better opportunities for DMMOs’ formal and informal learning; to use indicators to disrupt prevalent mindsets; with easily understandable data that is perceived as relevant to their needs. © 2023 The Authors",Absorptive capacity; Destination marketing/management organisations; Evidence-based policy; Outcome mapping; Sustainable tourism indicator,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-machine learning
A farmer-centric agricultural decision support system for market dynamics in a volatile agricultural supply chain,Tripathi P.K.; Singh C.K.; Singh R.; Deshmukh A.K.,2023,10.1108/BIJ-12-2021-0780,"Purpose: In a volatile agricultural postharvest market, producers require more personalized information about market dynamics for informed decisions on the marketed surplus. However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agricultural decision support system; Agricultural supply chain; Market intelligence system; Optimal marketing strategy; Predictive modelling; Risk management,Emerald Publishing,scopus-machine learning
"A social CRM analytic framework for improving customer retention, acquisition, and conversion",Lamrhari S.; Ghazi H.E.; Oubrich M.; Faker A.E.,2022,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121275,"Social Customer Relationship Management (social CRM) has become one of the central points for many companies seeking to improve their customer experience.

An emoji feature-incorporated multi-view deep learning for explainable sentiment classification of social media reviews,Xu Q.A.; Jayne C.; Chang V.,2024,10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123326,"Sentiment analysis has demonstrated its value in a range of high-stakes domains. From financial markets to supply chain management, logistics, and technology legitimacy assessment, sentiment analysis offers insights into public sentiment, actionable data, and improved decision forecasting. This study contributes to this growing body of research by offering a novel multi-view deep learning approach to sentiment analysis that incorporates non-textual features like emojis. The proposed approach considers both textual and emoji views as distinct views of emotional information for the sentiment classification model, and the results acknowledge their individual and combined contributions to sentiment analysis. Comparative analysis with baseline classifiers reveals that incorporating emoji features significantly enriches sentiment analysis, enhancing the accuracy, F1-score, and execution time of the proposed model. Additionally, this study employs LIME for explainable sentiment analysis to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enabling high-stakes businesses to understand the factors driving customer sentiment. The present study contributes to the literature on multi-view text classification in the context of social media and provides an innovative analytics method for businesses to extract valuable emotional information from electronic word of mouth (eWOM), which can help them stay ahead of the competition in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In addition, the findings of this paper have important implications for policy development in digital communication and social media monitoring. Recognizing the importance of emojis in sentiment expression can inform policies by helping them better understand public sentiment and tailor policy solutions that better address the concerns of the public. © 2024 The Author(s)",Explainable sentiment analysis; High-stakes decision forecasting; Marketing analytics; Multi-view learning; Social media reviews,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-machine learning

Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches. The paper concludes by describing company forecasting practices, offering conclusions as to both research gaps and barriers to improved practice. © 2019 International Institute of Forecasters",Comparative accuracy; Forecasting practice; Marketing analytics; New products; Product hierarchies; Retail forecasting; Social media data,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-machine learning
Customer determinants of used auto loan churn: comparing predictive performance using machine learning techniques,Valluri C.; Raju S.; Patil V.H.,2022,10.1057/s41270-021-00135-6,"This paper addresses the use of a customer character model as a determinant of used auto loan churn among a unique population of subprime borrowers. The customer character model (i.e restricted model) is compared to a full model consisting of the 4 Cs of capacity, collateral, credit, and character of churn prediction. The results reveal that there is a difference between the full model and the customer character model. Additionally, different supervised classification methods, such as logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision trees (DTs), and random forests (RFs), are applied and compared in terms of multiple predictive performance measures. The RF classification measures report the strongest performance. Additionally, different classification methods suggest the importance of different customer character variables. Therefore, from a practical perspective, effective borrower character screening is recommended to determine customer profiles more accurately for the purposes of target marketing and customer retention. This study also deepens understanding of subprime credit markets and reveals additional insights to credit screening using machine learning techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",4 Cs; Auto loans; Churn; Classification techniques; Credit screening; Machine learning; Subprime; Supervised learning,Palgrave Macmillan,scopus-machine learning
Mood detection and prediction using conventional machine learning techniques on COVID19 data,Bhattacharya S.; Agarwala A.; Roy S.,2022,10.1007/s13278-022-00957-x,"Emotion detection is a promising field of research in multiple perspectives such as psychology, marketing, network analysis and so on. Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",COVID Twitter data; Machine learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction,Springer,scopus-machine learning
"Combining Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 and MODIS data for major winter crop type classification over the Murray Darling Basin in Australia",Al-Shammari D.; Fuentes I.; Whelan B.M.; Wang C.; Filippi P.; Bishop T.F.A.,2024,10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101200,"Crop type classification is an essential task in agriculture that has been studied widely since the emergence of remote sensing technologies. Accurate crop mapping can help assist decision-making related to storage, marketing, and other production tasks. This study has designed robust crop classification models to classify two major crop types (cereals and canola) in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. These models combined Sentinel 1 and 2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Three methods were applied to test classification quality: the holdout method, leave-one-season-out cross-validation (LOSOCV), and leave-one-cluster-out-cross-validation (LOCOCV). The holdout method evaluated the model's performance on data representing the entire population. The LOSOCV method was used to test the model's ability to extrapolate over time (unseen data from new seasons), and the LOCOCV method was used to test the ability to extrapolate over space (data from a new site). Crop type labelled data (n = 193 for cereals and n = 113 for canola) were extracted from high-resolution yield maps derived from grain yield monitors mounted on harvesters, and this was used to train and validate the classification models. The results showed that the holdout validation approach achieved the highest accuracy (overall and Kappa scores >0.98), but this might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the sampling strategy implemented, which leads to an overoptimistic scenario. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores achieved from the LOSOCV method varied depending upon the difference in crop phenology from season to season, with overall accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 0.92 and Kappa scores from 0.61 to 0.90. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores for the LOCOCV ranged from 0.87 to 0.99 and 0.84 to 0.98, respectively. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and the chlorophyll red edge index (CIr) were the most important features across the three models. The outputs of this research can potentially complement models that require crop type information, such as carbon cycling and crop yield models. © 2024 The Authors",Gross primary productivity; Machine learning; Optical remote sensing; Radar; Yield monitor data,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-machine learning
Session stitching using sequence fingerprinting for web page visits,De Smedt J.; Lacka E.; Nita S.; Kohls H.-H.; Paton R.,2021,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113579,"The nature of people's web navigation has significantly changed in recent years. The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Sequence mining; Session fingerprinting; Session stitching; Web analytics,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-machine learning
A theory of predictive sales analytics adoption,Habel J.; Alavi S.; Heinitz N.,2023,10.1007/s13162-022-00252-0,"Given the pervasive ubiquity of data, sales practice is moving rapidly into an era of predictive analytics, using quantitative methods, including machine learning algorithms, to reveal unknown information, such as customers’ personality, value, or churn probabilities. However, many sales organizations face difficulties when implementing predictive analytics applications. This article elucidates these difficulties by developing the PSAA model—a conceptual framework that explains how predictive sales analytics (PSA) applications support sales employees’ job performance. In particular, the PSAA model conceptualizes the key contingencies governing how the availability of PSA applications translates into adoption of these applications and, ultimately, job performance. These contingencies determine the extent to which sales employees adopt these applications to revise their decision-making and the extent to which these updates improve the decision outcome. To build the PSAA model, we integrate literature on predictive analytics and machine learning, technology adoption, and marketing capabilities. In doing so, this research provides a theoretical frame for future studies on salesperson adoption and effective utilization of PSA. © 2023, The Author(s).",Advanced analytics; Machine learning; Personal selling; Predictive analytics; Sales force effectiveness; Sales management,Springer,scopus-machine learning

Companies increasingly use algorithms to generate predictions for marketing decisions, such as which consumers to target with which offers. Such algorithmic decision-making promises to make marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective. Not surprisingly, machine learning is a trending topic for marketing researchers and practitioners. However, machine learning also introduces important challenges to the marketing landscape. We discuss this development by outlining recent progress and future research directions of machine learning in marketing. Specifically, we provide an overview of typical machine learning applications in marketing and present a guiding framework. We position the articles in the Journal of Business Research's Special Issue on “Machine Learning in Marketing” within this framework and conclude by putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Algorithm; Machine learning; Marketing; Privacy; Research agenda,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-machine learning
M-GAN-XGBOOST model for sales prediction and precision marketing strategy making of each product in online stores,Wang S.; Yang Y.,2021,10.1108/DTA-11-2020-0286,"Purpose: The rapid development of e-commerce has brought not only great convenience to people but a great challenge to online stores. Phenomenon such as out of stock and slow sales has been common in recent years. These issues can be managed only when the occurrence of the sales volume is predicted in advance, and sufficient warnings can be executed in time. Thus, keeping in mind the importance of the sales prediction system, the purpose of this paper is to propose an effective sales prediction model and make digital marketing strategies with the machine learning model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the consumer purchasing behavior decision theory, we discuss the factors affecting product sales, including external factors, consumer perception, consumer potential purchase behavior and consumer traffic. Then we propose a sales prediction model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, using the time-series prediction that ensures the effective prediction of sales about each product in a short time on online stores based on the sales data in the previous term or month or year. The proposed M-GNA-XGBOOST model serves as an adaptive prediction model, for which the instant factors and the sales data of the previous period are the input, and the optimal computation is based on the proposed methodology. The adaptive prediction using the proposed model is developed based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The model inherits the advantages among the algorithms with better accuracy and forecasts the sales of each product in the store with instant data characteristics for the first time. Findings: The analysis using Jingdong dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is enhanced and the accuracy that instant data as input is found to be better compared with the model that lagged data as input. The root means squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed model are found to be around 11.9 and 8.23. According to the sales prediction of each product, the resource can be arranged in advance, and the marketing strategy of product positioning, product display optimization, inventory management and product promotion is designed for online stores. Originality/value: The paper proposes and implements a new model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, to predict sales of each product for online stores.

USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR RFM SEGMENTATION: A CASINO DIRECT MARKETING COMMUNICATION CASE; [KORIŠTENJE NADZIRANIH METODA STROJNOGA UČENJA ZA RFM SEGMENTACIJU: SLUČAJ IZRAVNE MARKETINŠKE KOMUNIKACIJE KASINA],Bratina D.; Faganel A.,2023,10.22598/mt/2023.35.1.7,"Purpose – This paper explores various supervised machine learning algorithms as an additional classification method to RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) models with the aim of improving the accuracy in predicting target groups of customers for direct marketing response campaigns conducted by a casino. The purpose of this paper is twofold – first, to test how the addition of demographic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach – Our research employed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino’s direct marketing activities to improve the company’s RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications – The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company’s own RFM segmentation was also found to perform well. Limitations – Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models’ power. While all models developed are applicable to similar data, they could lose their accuracy when applied to data from a different industry. The company’s own RFM model was not analyzed but was included in the model as is. Further insight could be gained by determining its optimal pa-rameters. Originality – This study contributes to the existing litera-ture by showing how direct marketing efficiency modeling using standard RFM could be improved with the addition of a company’s customer property. It also provides insight into how classification algorithms perform on a casino database of direct marketing activities. © 2023, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

Examining urban delivery service user profiles and determinants of drone delivery adoption in Ghana considering usage before and after the COVID-19 pandemic,Tamakloe R.; Zhang K.; Atandzi J.; Park D.,2024,10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.12.004,"The demand for urban delivery services (UDS) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been growing due to the spike in e-commerce activities. This phenomenon has led to the search for more innovative UDS modes, such as drones, as they provide fast, safer, and eco-friendly services. Although researchers have examined the perceptions regarding the adoption of drone delivery, there are many unknowns about the intentions to use this futuristic delivery mode. By employing survey data obtained through an online survey conducted in Ghana, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the current UDS user profiles and investigate their intentions to adopt drone deliveries in the future, considering the lived experiences of traditional UDS usage pre/post the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding UDS user profiling, the study applied an advanced unsupervised machine learning method known as cluster correspondence analysis to simultaneously identify critical clusters in the data as well as key factor associations for each group. The findings demonstrated that most people in Ghana who seldom used the traditional UDS usually experienced poor service levels. Females living in the capital of Ghana who are frequent users of UDS mainly experienced acceptable service levels. Using an ordered probit regression model, the study identified that variables such as males, people who desired contactless UDS, and frequent UDS users at work or school during the COVID-19 pandemic were more inclined to embrace drone deliveries when introduced. Conversely, individuals who frequently used UDS services at home, those living in large cities, and those with lower income levels expressed reluctance toward drone delivery services. This study augments the urban logistics literature in LMICs by offering insightful suggestions in the areas of education, enhanced marketing strategies, and delivery optimization, which are instrumental for informing policy decisions. Government-related transportation bodies, private logistics firms, and trade unions can collaborate and adopt the recommendations provided to improve urban delivery services and to pave the way for integrating drone delivery services in the near future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Drone deliveries; Low- and middle-income country; Machine learning; Probit; Urban logistics,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-machine learning
Interpretable Optimal Stopping,Ciocan D.F.; Mišić V.V.,2022,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3592,"Optimal stopping is the problem of deciding when to stop a stochastic system to obtain the greatest reward, arising in numerous application areas such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy’s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Poor’s 500 Index data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art noninterpretable methods, based on simulation regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure. © 2020 INFORMS",approximate dynamic programming; decision trees; interpretability; optimal stopping; option pricing,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-machine learning
The Problem of Copyright Protection for Machine Learning Databases: A Comparative Study,Khong D.W.K.; Yeh W.-J.,2021,,"This paper examines the applications of copyright protection standards to the creation and utilisation of databases for machine learning purposes and compares the law from Malaysia, Taiwan and the European Union. The current international regime for copyright protection of databases requires that compilations of data be protected “by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents [which] constitute intellectual creations"". However, Malaysia continues to follow the sweat of the brow approach to copyright protection of tables or compilations although a provision similar to TRIPS separately exists. On the other hand, Taiwan adopts a similar, but not identical approach to the TRIPS. The key differences are that Taiwan’s formulation uses the word “creativity” instead of “creation” sans“intellectual” and uses the conjunction “and” instead of “or” between selection and arrangement. The ECJ’s decision in Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo! UK Ltd in interpreting the European Database Directive emphasised that copyright protection for databases must be determined solely on the basis of the selection or arrangement but not on the creation of content. Likewise, the Fixture Marketing cases decided by the ECJ held that only the obtaining, verification or presentation of “existing independent material” matters to the sui generis database rights but not that of newly created data. It would appear that most, if not all, machine learning datasets will not satisfy the “intellectual creations” requirement and thus fail to qualify for copyright protection. Enacting a universal sui generis database protection may not be an easy solution. Perhaps, it is time for the international community to get down from the philosophical high horse and to accept that databases should be protected in copyright simply on account of the effort in their compilation, without the necessity to judge whether there is any intellectual input in the selection or arrangement of their content. © 2021",Copyright Protection of Databases; European Database Directive; Machine Learning Datasets; Malaysia; Taiwan,National Taipei University of Technology,scopus-machine learning
Analysing Chinese citizens' intentions of outbound travel: A machine learning approach,Zhang C.; Zhang J.,2014,10.1080/13683500.2013.768606,"Due to the tremendous expansion of Chinese outbound travel market, it is of great significance to identify the characteristics of potential Chinese outbound tourists so as to develop targeted marketing strategies. As both extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of individuals are important in influencing their decision-making process, this study explores potential Chinese outbound tourists from these two aspects. Demographic and psychographic factors, as the proxy of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics, respectively, are incorporated into this study to construct the relationship between tourists' characteristics and their intentions of outbound travel. An advanced machine learning approach, called twice-learning, is employed for modelling in this study. As an intelligent data analysis tool, this method is able to construct models that can provide insight into the ground-truth relationships hidden beneath the data in an essentially comprehensible way, without being limited by the typical assumptions held by the traditional data analysis methods. By applying this method, the important personal factors that influence Chinese citizens' intentions of outbound travel are detected, and the typical groups of potential Chinese outbound tourists are characterised.

Customer acquisition via display advertising using multi-armed bandit experiments,Schwartz E.M.; Bradlow E.T.; Fader P.S.,2017,10.1287/mksc.2016.1023,"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known “learn-and-earn” trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser’s MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel. © 2017 INFORMS.",A/B testing; Adaptive experiments; Earning-and-learning; Explore-exploit; Field experiments; Hierarchical models; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandit; Online advertising; Reinforcement learning; Sequential decision making,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-machine learning

A hybrid approach for predicting customers’ individual purchase behavior,Peker S.; Kocyigit A.; Eren P.E.,2017,10.1108/K-05-2017-0164,"Purpose: Predicting customers’ purchase behaviors is a challenging task. The literature has introduced the individual-level and the segment-based predictive modeling approaches for this purpose. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and performs in certain cases. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach which predicts customers’ individual purchase behaviors and reduces the limitations of these two methods by combining the advantages of them. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hybrid approach is established based on individual-level and segment-based approaches and utilizes the historical transactional data and predictive algorithms to generate predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in the domain of supermarket shopping by using real-world data and using five popular machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests. Findings: A comparison of results shows that the proposed hybrid approach substantially outperforms the individual-level and the segment-based approaches in terms of prediction coverage while maintaining roughly comparable prediction accuracy to the individual-level method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that logistic regression performs better than the other classifiers in predicting customer purchase behavior. Practical implications: The study concludes that the proposed approach would be beneficial for enterprises in terms of designing customized services and one-to-one marketing strategies.

Estimating the knowledge function, we found-in line with LASSO-that medium-sized firms, human capital (training) and credit facilities favorably affect firms' decision to invest in R&D. Contrarily, the impact is adverse if the first or main product generates firms' large share of revenue, a unique finding not captured by previous studies. The marginal effects of four univariate probit models indicate that firms' investment in R&D translates into innovation. However, the application of the Geweke-Hajivassiliour-Keane (GHK)-simulator based multivariate probit, which considers simultaneity of firms' innovation decisions that univariate probit ignores, suggests that the relationship between different types of innovation is complementary. Firms' strategy to adopt a particular type of innovation is influenced by other types. This led to the estimation of R&D's impact on technological and nontechnological innovation, which shows that while firms innovate both types, there is a skewed link between nontechnological innovation and the services sector. © 2020 by the author.",LASSO; Multivariate probit; Nontechnological innovation; R & D; Technological innovation; Tobit,MDPI,scopus-machine learning

The Reserve Price Optimization for Publishers on Real-Time Bidding on-Line Marketplaces with Time-Series Forecasting,Wodecki A.,2020,10.2478/fman-2020-0013,"Today's Internet marketing ecosystems are very complex, with many competing players, transactions concluded within milliseconds, and hundreds of different parameters to be analyzed in the decision-making process. In addition, both sellers and buyers operate under uncertainty, without full information about auction results, purchasing preferences, and strategies of their competitors or suppliers. As a result, most market participants strive to optimize their trading strategies using advanced machine learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a new approach to determining reserve-price strategies for publishers, focusing not only on the profits from individual ad impressions, but also on maximum coverage of advertising space. This strategy combines the heuristics developed by experienced RTB consultants with machine learning forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet. The paper analyses the effectiveness of these algorithms, recommends the best one, and presents its implementation in real environment. As such, its results may form a basis for a competitive advantage for publishers on very demanding online advertising markets.  © 2020 Andrzej Wodecki, published by Sciendo 2020.",forecasting; machine learning; online marketing; real-time bidding; reserve price optimization,Sciendo,scopus-machine learning
Hybrid machine learning approach for popularity prediction of newly released contents of online video streaming services,Jeon H.; Seo W.; Park E.; Choi S.,2020,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120303,"In the industry of video content providers such as VOD and IPTV, predicting the popularity of video contents in advance is critical, not only for marketing but also for network usage. By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts. Experiments are carried out with a dataset from one of the top streaming service companies, and results display overall better performance compared to various standalone methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Deep learning; Embeddings; Gradient boosting decision tree; Popularity prediction; Streaming service,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-machine learning
Revealing customers’ satisfaction and preferences through online review analysis: The case of Canary Islands hotels,Ahani A.; Nilashi M.; Yadegaridehkordi E.; Sanzogni L.; Tarik A.R.; Knox K.; Samad S.; Ibrahim O.,2019,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.06.014,"Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Canary islands; Customer satisfaction; Hotel; Machine learning; Market segmentation; Multi-criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preferences analysis,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-machine learning
Prediction of grape yields from time-series vegetation indices using satellite remote sensing and a machine-learning approach,Arab S.T.; Noguchi R.; Matsushita S.; Ahamed T.,2021,10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100485,"Grape yield prediction is an important tool used by growers to optimize vineyard management and obtain better income. In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",LAI; Machine learning; NDVI; NDWI; Satellite remote sensing; Vineyard yield,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-machine learning
Machine learning as an effective paradigm for persuasive message design,Zwilling M.; Levy S.; Gvili Y.; Dostal P.,2020,10.1007/s11135-020-00972-0,"The impact of the development of the internet and new communications channels on the marketing industry pushed practitioners to devise new tools and approaches for influencing consumer attitudes and behaviors towards products and services. This has led to new insights into persuasive message design. In general, persuasive advertisement messaging can be viewed as a combination of context, i.e., a message, and additional affiliated components such as images, video, and special graphics. It is composed out of two main attribute categorizations: (1) textual content such as a product description or affiliated message and (2) sensible content such as product image, color, or even scent. In a competitive market in which consumers are constantly exposed to a hyper-abundance of products that also contain sensible attributes, it is crucial to design persuasive messages that will maximally appeal to desired consumers and evoke their positive response. Yet only a few studies have focused on the effective design of persuasive advertisement messages characterized by two integrated elements. As such, this research focuses on effective persuasive message design with integrated product scent and color attributes. We demonstrate how a machine learning process can be utilized to generate optimal persuasive messages by estimating the contribution of each message attribute to the final class attribute: the purchase intention response. Our results show that several prediction algorithms can enhance consumer response value. In addition, correlations between several attributes affiliated with the message can be derived by graph theory-based estimation. This research thus provides insight into attribute values important for management decisions, with implications for effective persuasive message design. Ultimately, this may lead to higher response rates for marketing practitioners in an increasingly competitive market. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Advertising; Machine learning; Product design; Symbolic design,Springer,scopus-machine learning

Analysis of purchase history data based on a new latent class model for RFM analysis,Zhang Q.; Yamashita H.; Mikawa K.; Goto M.,2020,10.7232/IEMS.2020.19.2.476,"Recently, it has become easier to make use of various kinds of information on customers (e.g. customers' purchase history), due to the development of information technology. Especially in the marketing field, in fact, many companies try to employ customer segmentation for the services customization which leads to increase customer loyalty and to keep high customer retention. One of the well-known approaches for the customer analysis based on purchase history data is the RFM analysis. The RFM analysis is usually used to segment customers into several groups by using three variables; how long it has been since their last purchase, how many times they purchased, and how much they spent. However, the conventional method of the RFM analysis did not assume a generative model. Therefore, when applying to an actual data set and scoring each index of R, F, M scores, several problems occur. The main problem is that an analyst should arbitrarily decide the threshold for the scores of RFM. On the other hand, in the field of machine learning, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis is widely used for soft clustering. The latent class model enables us to cluster customers into latent classes and to calculate the assignment probabilities of each customer to each latent class. In this paper, we propose a new latent class model for the RFM analysis based on the purchase history data. The proposed model enables to decide the scoring of RFM and segment customers automatically, and the soft clustering approach helps the interpretation of the result. Furthermore, the proposed model takes account of the generation model of RFM scores. From the result of actual data analysis, it became clear that it is possible to extract latent classes that express the statistical characteristics of data well. Given a generative model estimated from the given data, it is also possible to predict future purchase behaviors of customers or to generate virtual data for simulation analysis and make decisions based on the result. We verify the effectiveness of our model by analyzing a real purchase history data of a Japanese major retail company. © 2020 KIIE",Latent Class Model; Marketing Segmentation; RFM Analysis,Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers,scopus-machine learning

Do online reviews truly matter? A study of the characteristics of consumers involved in different online review scenarios,Li Y.; Zhang L.,2021,10.1080/0144929X.2020.1759691,"Online reviews have become one of the most influential persuasive messages concerning decisions making. Researchers have explored different aspects of online reviews and the characteristics of reviewers using various methods; however, few studies have focused on consumers who do not post online reviews after purchasing, resulting in a gap in the research. This study aims to identify consumers’ characteristics and analyze the importance of consumers in different online review scenarios. We employed a fusion analysis framework, which used machine learning to determine the value of different types of consumers; in addition, we quantitatively estimate the relationship between variables and consumer types using econometrics modelling. This research used real consumer data from three data resources, solving problems related to the use of limited questionnaire datasets and single-source data. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that lurkers are more valuable than posters because they can be easily served and create more profit; thus, researchers should consider those who do not post online reviews rather than focusing only on the influence of online reviews and posters. Our findings also provide managerial implications for precision marketing by indicating that e-marketers should employ various marketing strategies and pay attention to different types of consumers, especially lurkers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",consumer characteristics; E-commerce; fusion analysis; Online review scenarios; precision marketing,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-machine learning
The right metrics for marketing-mix decisions,Mintz O.; Gilbride T.J.; Lenk P.; Currim I.S.,2021,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.08.003,"This study addresses the following question: For a given managerial, firm, and industry setting, which individual metrics are effective for making marketing-mix decisions that improve perceived performance outcomes? We articulate the key managerial takeaways based on testing a multi-stage behavioral framework that links decision context, metrics selection, and performance outcomes. Our statistical model adjusts for potential endogeneity bias in estimating metric effectiveness due to selection effects and differs from past literature in that managers can strategically choose metrics based on their ex-ante expected effectiveness. The key findings of our analysis of 439 managers making 1287 decisions are that customer-mindset marketing metrics such as awareness and willingness to recommend are the most effective metrics for managers to employ while financial metrics such as target volume and net present value are the least effective. However, relative to financial metrics, managers are more uncertain about the ex-ante effectiveness of customer-mindset marketing metrics, which attenuates their use. A second study on 142 managers helps provide detailed underlying rationale for these key results. The implications of metric effectiveness for dashboards and automated decision systems based on machine learning systems are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Endogenous regression; Hierarchical Bayes; Managerial decision-making; Metric effectiveness; Rational expectations,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-machine learning
Modeling multimodal continuous heterogeneity in conjoint analysis—a sparse learning approach,Chen Y.; Iyengar R.; Iyengar G.,2017,10.1287/mksc.2016.0992,"Consumers’ preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model. © 2017 INFORMS.",Conjoint analysis; Multimodal continuous heterogeneity; Sparse machine learning,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-machine learning

They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machinelearning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

Model selection for direct marketing: Performance criteria and validation methods,Cui G.; Leung M.W.; Zhang G.; Li L.,2008,10.1108/02634500810871339,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of competing methods and model selection, which are non-trivial issues given the financial implications. Researchers have adopted various methods including statistical models and machine learning methods such as neural networks to assist decision making in direct marketing. However, due to the different performance criteria and validation techniques currently in practice, comparing different methods is often not straightforward. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the performance of neural networks with that of classification and regression tree, latent class models and logistic regression using three criteria - simple error rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and cumulative lift - and two validation methods, i.e. bootstrap and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Systematic experiments are conducted to compare their performance. Findings - The results suggest that these methods vary in performance across different criteria and validation methods. Overall, neural networks outperform the others in AUROC value and cumulative lifts, and the stratified ten-fold cross-validation produces more accurate results than bootstrap validation. Practical implications - To select predictive models to support direct marketing decisions, researchers need to adopt appropriate performance criteria and validation procedures.

Research on blind equalization algorithm of high-speed visible light communication signal based on machine learning and Marketing,Li Y.; Chen N.; Li H.,2021,10.5912/jcb1050,"In order to solve the problem of high communication error rate caused by inter symbol interference in high-speed visible light communication signal blind equalization algorithm, a high-speed visible light communication signal blind equalization algorithm is designed based on machine learning. The visible light communication channel model is constructed, and a fusion length limited coding mode is set to make the signal transmitted by visible light communication more in line with the overall response of the channel. The decision feedback equalizer is selected as the equalizer, and the channel cascade impulse response condition is set to compensate the distorted output of the channel. The blind equalization algorithm is designed to classify the data by unsupervised learning, and the extreme point of the error function is found through iterative calculation to optimize the equalizer. The simulation results show that under the same SNR test conditions, the bit error rate of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the blind equalization algorithm based on LMS and BP neural network. Under the condition of SNR = 20dB, the bit error rate is significantly reduced to the order of 10-5, with high communication quality. The VLC system uses an LED backlight display with a CMOS camera. In general, this panel is used to display marketing information. By adjusting the brightness of the CMOS camera's rolling shutter effect (RSE), additional data, such as dynamic content, may be wirelessly sent.

Modeling relationships between retail prices and consumer reviews: A machine discovery approach and comprehensive evaluations,Yang X.; Yang G.; Wu J.; Dang Y.; Fan W.,2021,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113536,"Setting the retail price as a part of marketing would affect customers' cognition regarding products and affect their post-purchase behavior of review writing. To deeply understand the relationships between retail prices and reviews, this paper designs an intelligent data-driven Generate/Test Cycle using a machine learning technique to automatically discover the relationship model from a huge amount of data without a prior hypothesis. From a unique dataset, various free-form relationship models with their own structures and parameters have been discovered. By the comprehensive evaluations of candidate models, a guided map was offered to understand the relationship between dynamic retail prices and the volume/valence of reviews for different types of products. Experimental results show that 37.69% of products in our sample exhibit the following trend: When the price is increased to a certain level, the volume of reviews shifts from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend. Results also demonstrate that a linearly increasing relationship model between prices and the valence of reviews is more suitable for the low-involvement products than for the high-involvement products.

Consideration-set heuristics,Hauser J.R.,2014,10.1016/j.jbusres.2014.02.015,"Consumers often choose products by first forming a consideration set and then choosing from among considered products.

Companies are currently trying to take advantage of the useful collective knowledge available on social networks to support different types of marketing decisions. The appropriate analysis of this information can offer marketing professionals with important competitive advantages. This work proposes a new methodology to extract the social collective behavior of Twitter users concerning a group of brands based on the users’ temporal activity. Time series of mentions made by individual users to each company's Twitter account are aggregated to obtain collective activity data for the companies, which is a consequence of both the company's and other users’ actions. These data are processed using classical unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as temporal clustering and hidden Markov models, to extract collective temporal behavior patterns and models of the dynamics of customers over time for a single brand and groups of brands. The derived knowledge can be used for different tasks, such as identifying the impact of a marketing campaign on Twitter and comparatively assessing the social behaviors of different brands and groups of brands to assist in making marketing decisions. Our methodology is validated in a case study from the wine market. Twitter data were gathered from four regions of different countries around the world with important wineries (Italy: Veneto, Portugal: Porto and Douro Valley, Spain: La Rioja, and United States: Napa Valley), and comparative behavior analysis was carried out from the perspective of the use of Twitter as a communication channel for marketing campaigns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Hidden Markov models; Marketing analysis; Social collective behavior; Social networks; Temporal clustering; Temporal Twitter Activity; Wineries,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-machine learning

We used computer technologies to attack this information overload problem. First, we developed automatic decision-making mechanisms to help each individual effectively share information. Second, we built a simulation test bed and proposed an evaluation matrix and then conducted an experimental evaluation of six different information-sharing strategies in terms of interest degrees, reachability, appreciation degrees, and communication cost. We also implemented two intelligent response mechanisms. The first one allows users to order information pieces according to the learned ratings of the information sources. The second mechanism dynamically adjusts the network structure based on machine-learning results. The simulation results show that such mechanisms would be very useful to motivate social-network users to adopt more selective information-sharing strategies. © 2014 IEEE.",Information overload; information sharing; intelligent response; social networks,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,scopus-machine learning

Spammer group detection using machine learning technology for observation of new spammer behavioral features,Cheng L.-C.; Hu H.-W.; Wu C.-C.,2021,10.4018/JGIM.2021030104,"Recently, the rapid growth in the number of customer reviews on e-commence platforms and in the amount of user-generated content has begun to have a profound impact on customer purchasing decisions. To counter the negative impact of social media marketing, some firms have begun hiring people to generate fake reviews which either promote their own products or damage their competitor’s reputation. This study proposes a framework, which takes advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, for the observation of behaviors among spammers. Then, based on the behavior of participants on web forums, the authors build up a post-reply network. The main focus is on the behavior-related features of the reviews, their propagation, and their popularity. The primary objective of this study is to build an effective online spammer detection model and the method detailed in this work can be used to improve the performance of spammer detection models. An experiment is carried out with a real dataset, the results of which indicate that these new features are important for identifying spammers. Finally, random walk clustering is applied to investigate the post-reply network. Some interesting and important features are observed in the interactions between a group of spammers which could be subjected to further research. © 2021 IGI Global.

A social-semantic recommender system for advertisements,García-Sánchez F.; Colomo-Palacios R.; Valencia-García R.,2020,10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102153,"Social applications foster the involvement of end users in Web content creation, as a result of which a new source of vast amounts of data about users and their likes and dislikes has become available. Having access to users’ contributions to social sites and gaining insights into the consumers’ needs is of the utmost importance for marketing decision making in general, and to advertisement recommendation in particular. By analyzing this information, advertisement recommendation systems can attain a better understanding of the users’ interests and preferences, thus allowing these solutions to provide more precise ad suggestions. However, in addition to the already complex challenges that hamper the performance of recommender systems (i.e., data sparsity, cold-start, diversity, accuracy and scalability), new issues that should be considered have also emerged from the need to deal with heterogeneous data gathered from disparate sources. The technologies surrounding Linked Data and the Semantic Web have proved effective for knowledge management and data integration. In this work, an ontology-based advertisement recommendation system that leverages the data produced by users in social networking sites is proposed, and this approach is substantiated by a shared ontology model with which to represent both users’ profiles and the content of advertisements. Both users and advertisement are represented by means of vectors generated using natural language processing techniques, which collect ontological entities from textual content. The ad recommender framework has been extensively validated in a simulated environment, obtaining an aggregated f-measure of 79.2% and a Mean Average Precision at 3 (MAP@3) of 85.6%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Advertising; Knowledge-based systems; Natural language processing; Recommender systems; Social network services,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-natural language processing
The Language of Brands in Social Media: Using Topic Modeling on Social Media Conversations to Drive Brand Strategy,Swaminathan V.; Schwartz H.A.; Menezes R.; Hill S.,2022,10.1177/10949968221088275,"This article highlights how social media data and language analysis can help managers understand brand positioning and brand competitive spaces to enable them to make various strategic and tactical decisions about brands. The authors use the output of topic models at the brand level to evaluate similarities between brands and to identify potential cobrand partners. In addition to using average topic probabilities to assess brands’ relationships to each other, they incorporate a differential language analysis framework, which implements scientific inference with multi-test-corrected hypothesis testing, to evaluate positive and negative topic correlates of brand names. The authors highlight the various applications of these approaches in decision making for brand management, including the assessment of brand positioning and future cobranding partnerships, design of marketing communication, identification of new product introductions, and identification of potential negative brand associations that can pose a threat to a brand's image. Moreover, they introduce a new metric, “temporal topic variability,” that can serve as an early warning of future changes in consumer preference. The authors evaluate social media analytic contributions against offline survey data. They demonstrate their approach with a sample of 193 brands, representing a broad set of categories, and discuss its implications. © American Marketing Association 2022.",brand engagement; brand positioning; brand strategy; branding‌; latent Dirichlet allocation; natural language processing; social media; topic modeling,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-natural language processing

Supporting decision making in design creativity through requirements identification and evaluation,Russo D.; Spreafico M.; Spreafico C.,2023,10.1080/21650349.2023.2189625,"Product innovation, based on the identification and implementation of new solutions, is essential to keep a company competitive. However, the risk of failure of a new solution must be properly weighted during the decision-making in the design activity. This study proposes a method to evaluate a new design solution through the comparison with an old one to be substituted, and based on their requirements. In order to better evaluate the new solution, new requirements about its specific peculiarities are extracted from patents of similar solutions and considered in the evaluation. Requirements extraction is carried out automatically, through natural language processing, while the evaluation considers technical, marketing, and economic criteria. In particular, financial proceeds and patents investments were considered. The proposed method was applied in a real industrial case study were the substitution of carbon fiber heating mat over the copper heating mat was assessed.

Construction and Application of the Attention Analysis Model of Brand Management Policies of Agricultural Products with Geographical Indications; [地理标志农产品品牌管理政策注意力分析模型构建及应用],Huo M.; Liu J.; Huang J.,2023,10.13998/j.cnki.issn1002-1248.23-0312,"[Purpose/Significance] Geographical indications (GIs) are an important tool for local governments in China to carry out brand building of agricultural products. Brand management is a continuous systematic project involving multiple subjects. Among them, the problem of government policy attention in the field of brand management of agricultural products with GIs deserves in-depth study. This paper aims to construct a policy attention analysis model in the field of brand management of GI agricultural products based on natural language processing technology. This model provides technical support for local governments to explore the status quo of local GI agricultural products' brand management, analyze the distribution of policy attention, and assist in optimizing strategies to promote their products' brand development. [Method/Process] The study is focused on the distribution of attention paths of GI agricultural products' brand management policies from the perspective of the local government: an analysis model of brand management policies of GI agricultural products was constructed in order to support the local government to carry out the analysis of the status quo of local agricultural products' brand management and policy optimization, and provide decision-making support for the optimization of brand management measures of the local agricultural products. First, this paper built a basic corpus based on the Python crawler technology, collected authoritative public information on the Internet, utilized the domain dictionary and UIE general information extraction framework to extract the text of management measures published in local government policies, and built a database of brand management measures of GI agricultural product. Second, a classification model of brand management measures of GI agricultural products based on the Transformer model was constructed. Third, this paper built a classification model based on the Transformer model, which can classify the extracted brand management measures of agricultural products and construct the policy attention distribution map. Finally, based on the policy attention distri-bution given by the model, we can find the brand management bottlenecks and recommend countermeasures to solve the bottlenecks. [Results/Conclusions] This paper takes Yantai apples as an example for model validation. After extracting and categorizing Yantai apples' brand management data, it is found that the policy attention of Yantai apples is more con-centrated, and the measures are highly similar, with 41.1% of the text of the measures focused on the part of brand positioning and planning, 31.7% on the part of brand competitiveness enhancement, and less than 10% on the part of brand marketing and protection. It can be seen that the brand effect of Yantai apples with GIs has not been well utilized. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology/Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi.

Identifying customer behavioral factors and price premiums of green building purchasing,Juan Y.-K.; Hsu Y.-H.; Xie X.,2017,10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.03.004,"In recent years, global urbanization and overdevelopment have resulted in environmental degradation and an energy crisis. Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed. The proposed model can be applied as an effective decision-support tool for green building pricing and formulating marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial neural network (ANN); Consumer behavior; Decision-support model; Green building; Price premium,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-neural network
Campaign participation prediction with deep learning,Ayvaz D.; Aydoğan R.; Akçura M.T.; Şensoy M.,2021,10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101058,"Increasingly, on-demand nature of customer interactions put pressure on companies to build real-time campaign management systems. Instead of having managers to decide on the campaign rules, such as, when, how and whom to offer, creating intelligent campaign management systems that can automate such decisions is essential. In addition, regulations or company policies usually restrict the number of accesses to the customers. Efficient learning of customer behaviour through dynamic campaign participation observations becomes a crucial feature that may ultimately define customer satisfaction and retention. This paper builds on the recent successes of deep learning techniques and proposes a classification model to predict customer responses for campaigns. Classic deep neural networks are good at learning hidden relations within data (i.e., patterns) but with limited capability for memorization. One solution to increase memorization is to use manually craft features, as in Wide & Deep networks, which are originally proposed for Google Play App. recommendations. We advocate using decision trees as an easier way of mining high-level relationships for enhancing Wide & Deep networks. Such an approach has the added benefit of beating manually created rules, which, most of the time, use incomplete data and have biases. A set of comprehensive experiments on campaign participation data from a leading GSM provider shows that automatically crafted features make a significant increase in the accuracy and outperform Deep and Wide & Deep models with manually crafted features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Decision tree classification; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Real-time marketing; Wide & Deep network models,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-neural network

The model can be used to guide decision makers on which type of data should be collected during international business development and further help them to prepare priority lists during strategic planning. Information derived from the model demonstrates that the most important factors that increase attractiveness of an international project are availability of funds, market volume, economic prosperity, contract type, and country risk rating. Similarly, level of competition, attitude of host government, existence of strict quality requirements, country risk rating, and cultural/religious similarities are the most important factors that affect competitiveness of Turkish contractors in international markets.",Bids; Construction industry; Contractors; Foreign projects; Neural networks; Turkey,,scopus-neural network

A hybrid intelligent approach for modeling brand choice and constructing a market response simulator,Kazemi S.M.R.; Hadavandi E.; Mehmanpazir F.; Nakhostin M.M.,2013,10.1016/j.knosys.2012.11.016,"Brand choice models, used for describing the process of choosing mutually exclusive alternatives, attracted a large amount of attention from researchers in the early of the recent decade. These models can be used as a market response simulator for simulating marketing strategies and assessing how changes in marketing variables such as pricing and promotions will influence consumer behavior and thus perform 'what-if' simulations. So a reliable and relevant brand choice model can be very useful and effective, which, in fact, represents a worthwhile opportunity to improve the efficiency of the marketing decisions. In this paper we offer a new approach by integrating of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Data preprocessing for brand choice modeling and constructing a market response simulator.

The effect of subjectivity and objectivity in online reviews: A convolutional neural network approach,Park S.K.; Song T.; Sela A.,2023,10.1002/jcpy.1382,"User reviews are now an essential source of information for consumers, exerting strong influence on purchase decisions. Broadly speaking, reviews rated by consumers as more helpful exert a greater influence downstream. The current research examines how the linguistic characteristics of a review affect its helpfulness score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), this research analyzes the linguistic subjectivity and objectivity of over 2 million reviews on Amazon. The results show that, ceteris paribus, both linguistic subjectivity and objectivity have a positive impact on review helpfulness. However, contrary to consumers' intuition, when subjectivity and objectivity are combined in the same review, review helpfulness increases less than their respective separate effects would predict, especially for hedonic products. We conceptualize that this results from the increased complexity of messages mixing subjective and objective sentences, which requires more effortful processing.

We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Logit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Logit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Logit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics. The method is illustrated on an artificial dataset where the market is heterogeneous. We then apply the approach to panel scanner data of purchase records, using the Logit to analyse the non-linearities detected by the neural network.

Using a neural network to forecast inflation,Aiken M.,1999,10.1108/02635579910291984,"Forecasting inflation is a major concern for economists and businessmen. Most researchers have relied upon statistical techniques with their stringent data assumptions and low accuracy rates to predict changes in inflation, but only a few have investigated how neural networks can improve forecasts. Here, we show the results of Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecasts from an artificial neural network using leading economic indicator data in the USA. Results show that the neural network predicts the level of the CPI with a high degree of accuracy.",,Emerald,scopus-neural network
Detecting fake reviewers from the social context with a graph neural network method,Cheng L.-C.; Wu Y.T.; Chao C.-T.; Wang J.-H.,2024,10.1016/j.dss.2023.114150,"With the development of mobile Web technologies, people can easily seek advice from social media before making purchases or decisions. Some companies employ expert writers to fabricate reviews or use automated techniques to improve the appeal of their products or services, or to undermine the credibility of their rivals. This obstructs the detection of fake reviews and reviewers. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network-based framework for detecting spammers, who originate fake reviews in discussion forums to capture information from different social network combinations in various subgraphs. These subgraphs include a complete social context graph, homogeneous user–user subgraph, and heterogeneous user–post subgraph. A novel two-stage architecture with focal loss was designed to create a training model. This model can be applied to solve the issue of imbalance data classification. The proposed framework was applied to evaluate a ground truth dataset collected from an actual fraudulent review event on a discussion forum. The experimental results show that this aggregate social context representation method can be effectively applied to detect fake reviewers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",eWOM marketing; Fake review detection; Graph neural network; Social context,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-neural network
Using neural networks to understand service risk in the holiday product,Mitchell V.-W.; Davies F.; Moutinho L.; Vassos V.,1999,10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00020-4,"Despite being one of the most symbolic, important, involving, costly, exciting, uncertain and complicated decisions most consumers make each year, holiday purchasing has received relatively little academic treatment in the service marketing literature. By extending and refining previous work, this study examines the usefulness of perceived risk theory to understand consumers' behaviour in one of the most common holiday experiences, the package holiday. Unlike other studies, this research undertakes a more detailed assessment of the risks involved, as well as examining how consumers reduce those risks. Forty-three risky attributes and fifteen risk reducers were identified and a neural network analysis uncovered a relationship between risk and risk reduction which involved functional, financial and hotel dominated risks, whilst the relationship between risk and purchase intention was mediated by trust in the tour operator and anxiety. The paper explores the nature of the risk in the holiday product and discusses how perceived risk can be measured and used by travel marketers in further research.

Predicting donation behavior: Acquisition modeling in the nonprofit sector using Facebook data,Schetgen L.; Bogaert M.; Van den Poel D.,2021,10.1016/j.dss.2020.113446,"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the value of Facebook data in predicting first-time donation behavior. More specifically, we provide evidence that Facebook data can be used as a valuable data source for nonprofit organizations in acquiring new donors. To do so, we evaluate three different dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e., singular value decomposition, non-negative matrix factorization, and latent Dirichlet allocation) over seven classification techniques (i.e., logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, bagged trees, random forest, adaboost, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks) using five times twofold cross-validation. Next, we assess what type of Facebook data and which predictors are most important. The results indicate that we can predict first-time donation behavior based on Facebook data with high predictive performance. Our benchmark indicates that the combination of singular value decomposition and logistic regression outperforms all other analytical methodologies with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.72 and a top decile lift of 3.33. The results show that Facebook pages and categories of Facebook pages are the most important data types. The most important predictors are dimensions related to age, education, residence, materialism, responsible consumption, and interest in nonprofits. The presented acquisition models can be used by nonprofit organizations to implement a one-to-one targeted marketing campaign towards Facebook fans. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to determine the predictive value of Facebook data for nonprofits in a real-life acquisition context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",CRM; Customer acquisition; Facebook; Predictive analytics; Social media,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-neural network
"Predicting cause-related marketing patronage intentions, corporate social responsibility motives and moderating role of spirituality",Suryavanshi A.K.S.; Bhatt V.; Thomas S.; Patel R.; Jariwala H.,2024,10.1108/SRJ-12-2022-0564,"Purpose: Recent studies have observed rise in consumer’s ethical concerns about the online retailers while making a purchase decision. The impetus for businesses to use corporate social responsibility (CSR) is evident, but the effects of CSR motives on corresponding processes underlying cause-related marketing (CRM) patronage intention have not been thoroughly examined. This study, anchored on attribution theory, established a research model that better explains the influence of CSR motives on patronage intentions toward CRM-oriented online retailers. Additionally, this study aims to examine the moderating role of spirituality (SPT) on CSR motives and CRM patronage intention (CPI). Design/methodology/approach: Primary data has been collected from 722 respondents and analyzed by using deep neural-network architecture by using the innovative PLS-SEM-ANN method to predict/rank the factors impacting CPI. Findings: The results revealed the normalized importance of the predictors of CPI and found that value-driven motive was the strongest predictor, followed by strategic motive, SPT, age and stakeholder-driven motive. In contrast, egoistic motive, education and income were found insignificant. Originality/value: The pandemic has transformed the way consumers shop and fortified the online economy, thereby resulting in a paradigm shift toward usage of e-commerce platforms. The results offer valuable insights to online retailers and practitioners for predicting patronage intentions by CSR motives and, thus, effectively engage CRM consumers by designing promotions in a way that would deeply resonate with them. This study assessed and predicted the factors influencing the CPI s, thereby guiding the online retailers to design CSR strategies and manage crucial CRM decisions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cause-related marketing; CRM patronage intentions; CSR motives; PLS-SEM-ANN; Spirituality,Emerald Publishing,scopus-neural network
Residual value forecasting using asymmetric cost functions,Dress K.; Lessmann S.; von Mettenheim H.-J.,2018,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.01.008,"Leasing is a popular channel for marketing new cars. However, the pricing of leases is complicated because the leasing rate must embody an expectation of the car's residual value after contract expiration. This paper develops resale price forecasting models in order to aid pricing decisions. One feature of the leasing business is that different forecast errors entail different costs. The primary objective of this paper is to identify effective ways of addressing cost asymmetry. Specifically, this paper contributes to the literature by (i) consolidating prior work in forecasting on asymmetric functions of the cost of errors; (ii) systematically evaluating previous approaches and comparing them to a new approach; and (iii) demonstrating that forecasting using asymmetric cost of error functions improves the quality of decision support in car leasing. For example, if the costs of overestimating resale prices are twice those of underestimating them, incorporating cost asymmetry into forecast model development reduces costs by about 8%. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters",Asymmetric cost of error; Automotive industry; Ensemble learning; Neural networks; Quantile regression,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-neural network
A Multiarmed Bandit Approach for House Ads Recommendations,Aramayo N.; Schiappacasse M.; Goic M.,2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1378,"Nowadays, websites use a variety of recommendation systems to decide the content to display to their visitors. In this work, we use a multiarmed bandit approach to dynamically select the combination of house ads to exhibit to a heterogeneous set of customers visiting the website of a large retailer. House ads correspond to promotional information displayed on the website to highlight some specific products and are an important marketing tool for online retailers. As the number of clicks they receive not only depends on their own attractiveness but also on how attractive are other products displayed around them, we decide about complete collections of ads that capture those interactions. More-over, as ads can wear out, in our recommendations we allow for nonstationary rewards. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of customer-level information, we embed a deep neural network to provide personalized recommendations within a bandit scheme. We tested our methods in controlled experiments where we compared them against decisions made by an experienced team of managers and the recommendations of a variety of other bandit policies. Our results show a more active exploration of the decision space and a sig-nificant increment in click-through and add-to-cart rates. © 2022 INFORMS.",deep learning; house ads; multiarmed bandits; personalization,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-neural network
"Predicting user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards fantasy sports gaming platforms: A large-sample study based on a model integrating philanthropic actions, well-being and flow experience",Suryavanshi A.K.S.; Thomas S.; Trivedi T.; Patel R.; Bhatt V.,2024,10.1002/nvsm.1819,"India has become one of the world's largest gaming destinations, and in the last few years, the rapid rise of online gaming has led to the domination of fantasy sports gaming platforms. Very little is understood about how users on fantasy sports gaming platforms perceive and approach giving and what essentially matters to users before selecting or engaging with such fantasy sports gaming platforms. This study aims to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards fantasy sports gaming platforms by examining philanthropic actions, well-being (WB) and flow experience (FE). A large-scale research study on 2091 samples was undertaken by adopting three-fold SEM-ANN-NCA (structural equation modeling-artificial neural network-necessary condition analysis) for establishing and empirically testing a comprehensive model by integrating philanthropic actions, WB and FE to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards online fantasy sports gaming platforms. The findings add depth to our understanding of philanthropic actions linked to fantasy sports gaming platforms and users' loyalty and donation intentions towards such platforms. The results of ANN indicated the normalized importance of the predictors of user loyalty and found that philanthropic action was the strongest predictor. Likewise, philanthropic actions, WB, and FE were necessary conditions (must-have) to determine user loyalty during NCA. The findings would provide invaluable intelligence to fantasy gaming companies to oversee critical philanthropic decisions proficiently. In addition, the results would provide valuable insights to decision-makers in philanthropic foundations and other entities, such as practitioners and online fantasy gaming companies, to devise effective marketing strategies to gauge user loyalty and shape donation intentions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",and fantasy sports gaming; flow experience; philanthropic actions; repeat intention to donate; user loyalty; well-being,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-neural network
A hybrid econometric-neural network modeling approach for sales forecasting,Luxhøj J.T.; Riis J.O.; Stensballe B.,1996,10.1016/0925-5273(96)00039-4,"Business sales forecasting is an example of management decision making in an ill-structured, uncertain problem domain. Due to the dynamic complexities of both internal and external corporate environments, many firms resort to qualitative forecasting techniques. However, these qualitative techniques lack the structure and extrapolation capability of quantitative forecasting models, and forecasting inaccuracies typically lead to dramatic disturbances in production planning. This paper presents the development of a hybrid econometric-neural network model for forecasting total monthly sales. This model attempts to integrate the structural characteristics of econometric models with the non-linear pattern recognition features of neural networks to create a ""hybrid"" modeling approach. A three-stage model is created that attempts to sequentially ""filter"" forecasts where the output from one stage becomes part of the input to the next stage. The forecasts from each of the individual sub-models are then ""averaged"" to compute the hybrid forecast. Model development is discussed in the content of an actual sales forecasting problem from a Danish company that produces consumer goods. Actual model performance is reported for a six-month time period. Knowledge gained from the modeling approach is placed in the context of organizational learning about the nature of sales forecasting for this particular company.",Hybrid econometric-neural network; Sales forecasting,Elsevier,scopus-neural network
Ranking Micro-Influencers: A Multimedia Framework with Multi-Task and Interpretable Architectures,Elwood A.; Gasparin A.; Rozza A.,2022,10.1142/S1793351X22400098,"With the rise in use of social media to promote branded products, the demand for effective influencer marketing has increased. Brands are looking for improved ways to identify valuable influencers among a vast catalogue; this is even more challenging with micro-influencers, which are more affordable than mainstream ones but difficult to discover. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework to improve the state of the art in micro-influencer ranking based on multimedia content. Moreover, since the visual congruence between a brand and influencer has been shown to be a good measure of compatibility, we provide an effective visual method for interpreting our model's decisions, which can also be used to inform brands' media strategies. We compare with the current state of the art on a recently constructed public dataset and we show significant improvement both in terms of accuracy and model complexity. We also introduce a methodology for tuning the image and text contribution to the final ranking score.

A dss-based dynamic programming for finding optimal markets using neural networks and pricing,Fazlollahtabar H.,2021,10.22059/IJMS.2020.269091.673397,"One of the substantial challenges in marketing efforts is determining optimal markets, specifically in market segmentation. The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets. The sensitivity analysis is performed using pricing concept.

Predicting cause-related marketing patronage intentions based on Schwartz's theory of human values: a large-scale sample study anchored on female fashion leadership,Thomas S.; A.K.S S.; Bhatt V.; Malkar V.; Pandey S.; Patel R.,2024,10.1108/JFMM-11-2023-0303,"Purpose: Businesses embark on cause-related marketing (CRM) initiatives as a marketing strategy to fortify consumers' behavioural intentions. Prior research indicates that human values could be tapped to understand the consumers' responses to perceived organizational motives behind undertaking social cause initiatives. This research employs Schwartz's theory of human values to examine consumers' patronage intentions towards CRM-linked fashion products. Moreover, fashion leaders play a crucial role in the diffusion of the latest fashion and fashion trends. This research investigates by integrating human values and fashion leadership, offering insights into CRM-linked fashion consumption motives. Design/methodology/approach: The overarching goal was to investigate the complex interplay between human values and female fashion leadership to predict CRM patronage intention (CPI). Hence, a large-scale research study on 2,050 samples was undertaken by adopting threefold partial least squares–multigroup analysis–artificial neural network (PLS-MGA-ANN) to establish and empirically test a comprehensive model. Findings: This study is unique as it establishes and validates the relative or normalized importance placed on human values by fashion leaders, thereby predicting CPIs. The results revealed that women with high-fashion leadership and specific value types (benevolence, universalism, self-direction) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion retailers. In addition, the findings validated that women with low-fashion leadership and specific value types (tradition, security, conformity) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion stores.

Product Choice with Large Assortments: A Scalable Deep-Learning Model,Gabel S.; Timoshenko A.,2022,10.1287/mnsc.2021.3969,"Personalized marketing in retail requires a model to predict how different marketing actions affect product choices by individual customers. Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

Cafe Galavis: a brand with the aroma of innovation,Perez Perez J.E.,2023,10.1108/EEMCS-04-2023-0100,"Learning outcomes: Upon completion of the case study, the students will be able to analyze the brand equity construct through the associative neural network model for decision-making; identify prospective scenarios through the Delphi method for the construction of strategic plans in organizations; and propose the innovation of a product by applying creativity techniques to enter international markets. Case overview/synopsis: Cafe Galavis was one of the leading family businesses in industrial development and had the highest business recognition, with a century of experience in producing and commercializing roasted and ground coffee in Cucuta, Colombia. In 2015, the diplomatic crisis between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela led to the indefinite closure of the Colombian–Venezuelan border, which caused an increase in income from smuggled coffee. In addition, the presence of different competitors and traditional brands negatively impacted the level of sales, which considerably affected financial stability. Likewise, internal difficulties of family nature and administrative management led to the change of senior management. By 2016, Juan Yáñez was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) and was in charge of avoiding the company’s closure. In January 2023, he received feedback from his consulting team, and upon evaluation of the new market challenges with his collaborators, he realized a great challenge that merited the search for a priority alternative solution. How to design a new product considering the loss of brand identity in the face of the generational change of its consumers? These were some of the challenges posed by the CEO that consequently required starting a strategic management process of innovation.

Using a heterogeneous multinomial probit model with a neural net extension to model brand choice,Hruschka H.,2007,10.1002/for.1013,"The multinomial probit model introduced here combines heterogeneity across households with flexibility of the (deterministic) utility function. To achieve flexibility deterministic utility is approximated by a neural net of the multilayer perceptron type. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method serves to estimate heterogeneous multinomial probit models which fulfill economic restrictions on signs of (marginal) effects of predictors (e.g., negative for price). For empirical choice data the heterogeneous multinomial probit model extended by a multilayer perceptron clearly outperforms all the other models studied. Moreover, replacing homogeneous by heterogeneous reference price mechanisms and thus allowing price expectations to be formed differently across households also leads to better model performance. Mean utility differences and mean elasticities w.r.t. price and price deviation from reference price demonstrate that models with linear utility and nonlinear utility approximated by a multilayer perceptron lead to very different implications for managerial decision making.

This study attempts to explore the combined effect for the benefit of our collaborator, a multinational corporation (MNC) in the consumer electronics industry in Singapore. Putting these three variables together as input variables results in a neural network model. Neural network training is conducted using historical data on CTV sales in Singapore collected over the past one and a half years. Sensitivity analysis is then performed to reduce input variables of neural networks. This is done by analyzing the weights of the input node connections in the trained neural networks using two different methods. The weaker variables can be excluded, and this results in a simpler model. Further, an R-Square value of almost 1 is obtained through the inclusion of an Unknown variable when the network model consisting only of the most influential variables is trained and tested.

Predicting Indian Shoppers’ Malls Loyalty Behaviour,Prashar S.; Singh H.; Parsad C.; Vijay T.S.,2017,10.1177/0256090917731431,"Mall managers tend to believe that purchasing decisions are made inside the shopping malls. These decisions, however, are influenced by various antecedent factors. This implies that shoppers look beyond the basic chore of shopping and experience while shopping plays a vital role. To attract the attention of shoppers, mall developers make huge investments in mall promotion and ambient factors in order to enhance the shopping experience. As the Indian shoppers’ euphoria about shopping malls gets toned down with time, mall managers need to focus on something more substantive. Such fundamental benefits can be offered to shoppers only if mall managers know what is more relevant for the shoppers visiting the malls. Past studies have identified a number of factors such as ambience, physical infrastructure, convenience, safety, and marketing activities. This research posits that a more optimal and focused approach in mall management requires identification of relative significance of various influencing factors. This way, mall managers would be able to offer the most meaningful benefits to shoppers at a very optimal level of investment. Once shoppers get what they value the most, they are expected to be more loyal to the shopping mall. Despite the development of various forecasting techniques, predicting mall loyalty has remained under-explored in marketing literature. This article addresses the gap by using neural network model to predict shoppers’ loyalty towards a particular mall. To gain more insights from the model, the authors have also identified relative significance of the factors impacting shoppers’ mall selection. This study establishes that mall shoppers value ‘convenience’ as the most influencing factor in their selection of malls. This factor alone garners one-third of the total weightage among the five factors, which reflects that significance of convenience is 66 per cent more than what is expected in a scenario when all determinants contribute equally. This strongly indicates that Indian mall shoppers are more utilitarian than hedonic. © 2017, © 2017 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.",Malls selection; Neural network; Predictive analysis; Retailing; Shopping environment; Shopping experience; Shopping mall,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-neural network

Dynamic pricing has been studied from the airline’s point of view, with a focus on demand forecasting and price differentiation. Early demand forecasting on a specific route can assist an airline in strategically planning flights and determining optimal pricing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A feedforward neural network was employed in the current study. Two hidden layers, consisting of 18 and 12 neurons, were incorporated to enhance the network’s capabilities. The activation function employed for these layers was tanh. Additionally, it was considered that the output layer’s functions were linear. The neural network inputs considered in this study were flight path, month of flight, flight date (week/day), flight time, aircraft type (Boeing, Airbus, other), and flight class (economy, business). The neural network output, on the other hand, was the ticket price. The dataset comprises 16,585 records, specifically flight data for Iranian airlines for 2022. Findings: The findings indicate that the model achieved a high level of accuracy in approximating the actual data. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to predict the optimal ticket price for various flight routes with minimal error. Practical implications: Based on the significant alignment observed between the actual data and the tested data utilizing the algorithmic model, airlines can proactively anticipate ticket prices across all routes, optimizing the revenue generated by each flight. The neural network algorithm utilized in this study offers a valuable opportunity for companies to enhance their decision-making processes. By leveraging the algorithm’s features, companies can analyze past data effectively and predict future prices. This enables them to make informed and timely decisions based on reliable information.

Forecasting Buying Intention Through Artificial Neural Network: An Algorithmic Solution on Direct-to-Consumer Brands,Prasad B.; Ghosal I.,2022,10.1177/23197145211046126,"The direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are emerging to reach more number of consumers with more potential to meet their expectations. They are characterized through their metamorphosis as the vertical brands sell their products from the manufacturer to consumers directly without any interruptions from distribution channels as in traditional mode of doing business. They are annihilating themselves in the virtual platforms and later disrupting their existing linear sales models. This empirical investigation is targeted to construct an algorithmic model through a deep learning process which has been instrumental to predict the purchase decision. This investigation has churned a predictive model that is based on the attributes of the buying behaviour of the consumers. The attributes of online buying behaviour like safety of transaction, availability of innovative products and quality of products have been considered to build a predictive model through artificial neural network (ANN). The accuracy of training and testing data are closer, which infers about the consistency and validity of the predictive model. There are several consequences arising from the predictive model obtained that can be seeded from customer-centred marketing and further stemmed from the framing of business strategy, gaining insights into market architecture and choice of customer © 2022 Fortune Institute of International Business.",artificial neural network (ANN); deep learning; demand forecasting; Direct to consumer brands; purchase intention,Sage Publications India Pvt.

What’s Stopping You from Migrating to Mobile Tourism Shopping?,Wan S.-M.; Cham L.-N.; Tan G.W.-H.; Lo P.-S.; Ooi K.-B.; Chatterjee R.-S.,2022,10.1080/08874417.2021.2004564,"Tourism shopping via mobile applications has revolutionized the tourism industry. The research examined the antecedents to the adoption of mobile tourism shopping (MTS) via an integrated model, consisting of the Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, consumer perception of merchant ethics, consumer decision-making styles, and characteristics of mobile applications. The results were empirically validated via the PLS-SEM-ANN method. The findings indicated that mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use, application quality, and service quality have significant positive correlations with the intention to use MTS, whereas privacy concern has displayed a significant negative relationship. Moreover, source reliability, application reputation, perfectionism, and novelty-fashion consciousness were revealed to be statistically insignificant to the development of adoption intention toward MTS. Furthermore, the ANN results have indicated the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute in the prediction of ANN Model A. The research has generated valuable theoretical implications and practical insights. For one, the advantages that come with the adoption of MTS and the security measures taken by the service providers should be highlighted to the prospects via effective marketing messages to nurture confidence, which can subsequently drive adoption. © 2021 International Association for Computer Information Systems.",artificial neural network analysis; consumer decision-making; Mobile commerce; privacy concern; tourism,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-neural network
Quality of life modelling based on decision trees; [Modelování kvality života pomocí rozhodovacích stromů],Krupka J.; Kašparová M.; Jirava P.,2010,,"This paper presents one of the possibilities of the decision theory that can be used in the modelling of the quality of life in a given city in the Czech Republic. Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city. Similar results were achieved through out our research when using the mentioned algorithms. However, the best results were achieved when using the C5.0 algorithm. Finally, we summarized the presented problems, and compared its accuracy in classification on the basis of decision trees, with classification results based on the probabilistic neural network and the radial basis function neural network.",Classification; Decision trees; Quality; Regional management,,scopus-neural network
Exploring the relationship between marketing and operations: Neural network analysis of marketing decision impacts on delivery performance,Marques A.; Lacerda D.P.; Camargo L.F.R.; Teixeira R.,2014,10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.02.020,"This study has the objective of exploring the relationship between two functional areas: marketing and operations. This relationship has been the focus of attention of other scholars, but much remains to be done in terms of providing a better understanding of it. To help fill this gap, we analyze the impact of marketing decisions on delivery performance. More specifically, we seek to know how sales, sellers, promotion and other variables that characterize marketing decisions impact delivery performance. We collected data about marketing decisions and delivery performance for a period of 30 months in a large manufacturing company in Brazil. We performed an artificial neural network analysis to assess how these marketing decision variables impact delivery performance variables in the company analyzed. Results show that seller characteristics are the variables that have the greatest impact on the performance of delivery operations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of misclassification costs on neural network classifiers,Berardi V.L.; Zhang G.P.,1999,10.1111/j.1540-5915.1999.tb00902.x,"The potential of neural networks for classification problems has been established by numerous successful applications reported in the literature. One of the major assumptions used in almost all studies is the equal cost consequence of misclassification. With this assumption, minimizing the total number of misclassification errors is the sole objective in developing a neural network classifier. Often this is done simply to ease model development and the selection of classification decision points. However, it is not appropriate for many real situations such as quality assurance, direct marketing, bankruptcy prediction, and medical diagnosis where misclassification costs have unequal consequences for different categories. In this paper, we investigate the issue of unequal misclassification costs in neural network classifiers. Through an application in thyroid disease diagnosis, we find that different cost considerations have significant effects on the classification performance and that appropriate use of cost information can aid in optimal decision making. A cross-validation technique is employed to alleviate the problem of bias in the training set and to examine the robustness of neural network classifiers with regard to sampling variations and cost differences.",Classification; Medical diagnosis; Misclassification Costs; Neural Networks; Statistical Techniques,Decision Sciences Institute,scopus-neural network

A two-stage SEM-neural network analysis to predict drivers of m-commerce in India,Madan K.; Yadav R.,2019,10.1504/IJEMR.2019.098750,"The rapid developments in the field of mobile technologies and deep penetration of smartphones have created tremendous opportunities for m-commerce worldwide. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors that predict consumer's intention to adopt m-commerce. The study identifies variables relevant for m-commerce environment and empirically establishes their influence on m-commerce adoption intention. A two-stage analysis comprising of structural equation modelling (SEM) and neural network (NN) technique is employed to test the proposed model. The results obtained from SEM analysis observed that perceived risk is the strongest predictor of m-commerce adoption decision, followed by performance expectancy, variety of services and perceived critical mass. Effort expectancy is found to be statistically insignificant. The significant factors from SEM were used as inputs to NN model and the results established performance expectancy to be the most important input variable in predicting m-commerce adoption intention followed by variety of services, perceived risk and perceived critical mass. The findings of this study are useful for m-commerce marketers and service providers, in developing suitable marketing strategies to scale up their business. This study is one of the few empirical studies conducted in India to examine the adoption intention of m-commerce.

A Neural Network Design to Support Decision Making with a Complex Multicriteria Problem,Boscarino M.; Gianoglio P.; Ostanello A.,1993,10.1080/12460125.1993.10511571,"This paper investigates the potentialities of the new technology based on neural networks to realize a DSS that might help the marketing and product planning management of a factory in conceiving strategic decisions regarding prices and product performance levels in an oligopolistic market. A possible oligopolistic market scenario assumes a multiplicity of customers whose choices on a given product set have to be explained; the individual choices of these subjects contribute to defining some market shares to be estimated—with their possible evolution—by a multicriteria model (management’s problem formulation). Very few computer based systems to support such a complex problem are found in literature; developed essentially with “classic” methodologies and techniques, they suffer from considering either one single decisional subject (the market/consumer) or a multiplicity of monocriterion choices under uncertainty conditions, without taking into account any integrated representation wich might permit a multiactorial interpretation of “the market” to be given. An approach based on neural networks seems to allow such limits to be overcome, as it has been applied successfully to design and develop a prototype of DSS (MUTANT) for the problem formulated. Some first computational experiments allow some positive judgements to be expressed about the system’s validity and the promising potentialities of a new “modelling and problem solving” approach that might be usefully applied so as to enlarge some potentialities of other multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) methods. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Explicative models; Multicriteria decisions; Multiple choices; Neural networks,,scopus-neural network
A comparative analysis of neuromarketing methods for brand purchasing predictions among young adults,Garczarek-Bąk U.; Szymkowiak A.; Gaczek P.; Disterheft A.,2021,10.1057/s41262-020-00221-7,"Until now, neuromarketing studies have usually been aimed at assessing the predictive value of psychophysiological measures gathered while watching a marketing message related to a particular product. This study is the first attempt to verify the possibility of predicting familiar and unfamiliar brand purchases based on psychophysiological reactions to a retailer television advertisement measured by EEG, EDA and eye-tracking. The number of private label products chosen later served to assess the binary dependent variable. A logistic regression model (with a prediction rate of 61.2%) was applied to determine which psychophysiological variables explained the largest part of the variance of a final purchase decision. The results show that among various measures, only the electrodermal peaks per second were significant in predicting further purchase decisions. The decision to buy was also influenced by brand familiarity. The article concludes that EDA is an unobtrusive measure of emotion-related anticipation of significant outcomes, particularly for dynamic stimuli, as related to decision-making. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",Decision making; EDA; EEG; Eye-tracking; Marketing communication; Neuroscientific methods,Palgrave Macmillan,scopus-prediction
How does Store Branded Lookalike Packaging Affect Competition in a Dyadic Supply Chain: A Consumer Confusion Perspective,Zha Y.; Guo X.; Chen H.; Ling L.,2022,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102841,"Store branded lookalike packaging resembling national brand product (NB) packaging creates confusion for consumers who are uncertain about their quality preference of the store brand product (SB). This paper presents a model for exploring the NB manufacturer's wholesale price decision, and the response of the SB retailer, considering consumer confusion. Consumers differ in their quality preferences for products and are classified into two groups: deliberate and confused, depending on whether they have precise quality preferences of the SB. We find that when facing a hybrid structure of consumers, the retailer will introduce the SB only when the quality preference difference between high- and low-end consumers is moderate. When the SB is offered, the retailer may not always benefit from targeting low-end consumers with the SB only; a mixed strategy by attracting low-end (high-end) consumers to the national (store) brand product can bring higher profit. Examining the effect of consumer confusion, we find that it may bring a win-win, lose-lose, or win-lose situation for the manufacturer and retailer, depending on the quality preference difference and proportion of high-end consumers. We then consider the case when being deliberate is a choice of the consumer, finding that the retailer will induce consumers to be deliberate only when the store brand quality is low. Consumer confusion will always create a win-win outcome for the manufacturer and retailer when (1) SB quality is higher than NB quality, (2) SB quality is endogenized, or (3) consumers are confused about their quality preference for both the NB and SB. The consumer surplus may be enhanced or weakened, depending on the retailer's market segmentation strategy. Our results reconcile some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical findings regarding the impacts of consumer confusion about the SB derived from lookalike packaging on a two-echelon supply chain, and our insights are robust. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Competition; Consumer confusion; Store brand; Store branded lookalike packaging; Supply chain management,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-prediction
Data-driven method for mobile game publishing revenue forecast,Su Y.; Backlund P.; Engström H.,2022,10.1007/s11761-021-00332-2,"Games as a service is similar to software as a service, which provides players with game content on a continuous monetization model. Game revenue forecast is vital to game developers to make the right business decisions, such as determining the marketing budget, controlling the development cost, and setting up benchmarks for evaluating game publishing performance. How to make the revenue forecast and integrate it with the game publishing process is hard for small and medium-sized independent (indie) game developers. This includes all steps of the process, from forecasting to decision-making based on the results. This paper provides a data-driven method that uses the mobile game revenue forecast based on different time-series prediction models to drive the game publishing. We demonstrate how to use the data-driven method to guide an indie game studio to forecast revenue and then set the revenue forecast as the internal benchmark to drive game publishing. In practice, we involve a real game project from an indie game studio and provide guidance for one of their casual game projects. Then, based on the revenue forecast, we discuss how to set the revenue forecast as an internal benchmark and drive the actions for mobile game publishing. Finally, we make a conclusion on how our data-driven method can be used to drive mobile game publishing and also discuss future research work. © 2021, The Author(s).",Benchmark; Business Intelligence; Game analytics; Game metrics; Game publishing; Indie game developer; Time-series prediction,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-prediction
Improving strawberry yield prediction by integrating ground-based canopy images in modeling approaches,Abd-Elrahman A.; Wu F.; Agehara S.; Britt K.,2021,10.3390/ijgi10040239,"Strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) are highly perishable fruit. Timely prediction of yield is crucial for labor management and marketing decision-making. This study demonstrates the use of high-resolution ground-based imagery, in addition to previous yield and weather information, for yield prediction throughout the season at different intervals (3-4 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks preharvest). Flower and fruit counts, yield, and high-resolution imagery data were collected 31 times for two cultivars (‘Florida Radiance’ and ‘Florida Beauty’) throughout the growing season. Orthorectified mosaics and digital surface models were created to extract canopy size variables (canopy area, average canopy height, canopy height standard deviation, and canopy volume) and visually count flower and fruit number. Data collected at the plot level (6 plots per cultivar, 24 plants per plot) were used to develop prediction models. Using image-based counts and canopy variables, flower and fruit counts were predicted with percentage prediction errors of 26.3% and 25.7%, respectively. Furthermore, by adding image-derived variables to the models, the accuracy of predicting out-of-sample yields at different time intervals was increased by 10-29% compared to those models without image-derived variables. These results suggest that close-range high-resolution images can contribute to yield prediction and could assist the industry with decision making by changing growers’ prediction practices. © 2021 by the authors.",Canopy size metrics; Fragaria x ananassa; High-resolution; Image analysis; Regression model,MDPI AG,scopus-prediction
Variable selection for collaborative filtering with market basket data,Hwang W.-Y.,2020,10.1111/itor.12518,"The market basket data in the form of a binary user–item matrix or a binary item–user matrix can be modeled as a binary classification problem, which actually tackles collaborative filtering (CF) as well as target marketing. Effective variable selection (VS) can increase the prediction accuracy as well as identify important users or items in CF as well as target marketing. Therefore, we propose two new VS approaches: a Pearson correlation-based approach and a forward random forests regression-based approach, comparing the performance in a variety of experimental settings. The experimental results show that the proposed VS approaches outperform the conventional approaches in the examples. Furthermore, the experimental results are more reasonable and informative than the previous experimental results because the binary misclassification error and Top-N accuracy for the user CF, the item CF, the user modeling, and the item modeling are all considered in this paper. © 2018 The Authors.

A field study based on point-of-sales data indicated that consumers tend to buy more unhealthy products in the evening. Two laboratory experiments confirmed that this is due to a decrease in self-control in the evening, which leads consumers to purchase more unhealthy products at this time. A follow-up eye-tracking experiment further revealed potential mechanisms whereby lower self-control causes consumers to focus more on unhealthy products and weakens the effect of attention to healthy products on purchases.

Influencer recommendation system: choosing the right influencer using a network analysis approach,Jha A.K.; Ray S.,2023,10.1108/MIP-04-2023-0149,"Purpose: The rise of social media has led to the emergence of influencers and influencer marketing (IM) domains, which have become important areas of academic inquiry. However, despite its prominence as an area for study, several significant challenges must be addressed. One significant challenge involves identifying, assessing and recommending social media influencers (SMIs). This study proposes a semantic network model capable of measuring an influencer's performance on specific topics or subjects to address this issue. This study can assist managers in identifying suitable SMIs based on their estimated reach. Design/methodology/approach: Data from popular YouTube influencers and publicly available performance measures (views and likes) are extracted. Second, the titles of the past videos made by the influencer are used to develop a semantic network connecting all the videos to other videos based on similarity measures. Third, the nearest neighbor approach extracts the neighbors of the target title video. Finally, based on the set of neighbors, a range prediction is made for the views and likes of the target video with the influencer. Findings: The results show that the model can predict an accurate range of views and likes based on the suggested video titles and the content creator, with 69–78% accuracy across different influencers on YouTube. Research limitations/implications: The current study introduces a novel and innovative approach that exploits the textual association between a SMI's previous content to forecast the outcome of their future content. Although the findings are encouraging, this research recognizes various constraints that upcoming researchers may tackle. Forecasting views of posts concerning novel subjects and precisely adjusting video view counts based on their age constitute two primary limitations of this study. Practical implications: Managers interested in hiring influencers can employ the suggested approach to evaluate an influencer's potential performance on a specific topic. This research aids managers in making informed decisions regarding influencer selection, utilizing data-based metrics that are simple to comprehend and explain.

"Improved retention analysis in freemium role-playing games by jointly modelling players’ motivation, progression and churn",Karmakar B.; Liu P.; Mukherjee G.; Che H.; Dutta S.,2022,10.1111/rssa.12730,"We consider user retention analytics for online freemium role-playing games (RPGs). RPGs constitute a very popular genre of computer-based games that, along with a player's gaming actions, focus on the development of the player's in-game virtual character through a persistent exploration of the gaming environment. Most RPGs follow the freemium business model in which the gamers can play for free but they are charged for premium add-on amenities. As with other freemium products, RPGs suffer from the curse of high dropout rates. This makes retention analysis extremely important for successful operation and survival of their gaming portals. Here, we develop a disciplined statistical framework for retention analysis by modelling multiple in-game player characteristics along with the dropout probabilities. We capture players’ motivations through engagement times, collaboration and achievement score at each level of the game, and jointly model them using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm) framework that further includes a time-to-event variable corresponding to churn. We capture the interdependencies in a player's level-wise engagement, collaboration, achievement with dropout through a shared parameter model. We illustrate interesting changes in player behaviours as the gaming level progresses. The parameters in our joint model were estimated by a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm which incorporated a divide-and-recombine approach for increased scalability in glmm estimation that was needed to accommodate our large longitudinal gaming data-set. By incorporating the level-wise changes in a player's motivations and using them for dropout rate prediction, our method greatly improves on state-of-the-art retention models. Based on data from a popular action based RPG, we demonstrate the competitive optimality of our proposed joint modelling approach by exhibiting its improved predictive performance over competitors. In particular, we outperform aggregate statistics based methods that ignore level-wise progressions as well as progression tracking non-joint model such as the Cox proportional hazards model. We also display improved predictions of popular marketing retention statistics and discuss how they can be used in managerial decision making. © 2021 Royal Statistical Society",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-prediction

Data collected from 757 respondents were analyzed. The results indicate that our integrated framework demonstrates a favorable level of prediction power for guests’ behavior, which verified the superiority of the suggested framework. Furthermore, its findings from fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis indicate that: (a) attitude toward green hotels, perceived behavioral control, sense of obligation, and corporate image are key drivers of guests’ intentions to visit green hotels; (b) three distinct configurations of guests’ intention drivers are likely to result in a high degree of intentions among customers to visit green hotels. The three solutions all contain the conditions of high attitude, corporate image, biospheric value, and green activities, which means that these conditions are vital components of a high intention among customers to visit green hotels.

PerCLTV: A General System for Personalized Customer Lifetime Value Prediction in Online Games,Zhao S.; Wu R.; Tao J.; Qu M.; Zhao M.; Fan C.; Zhao H.,2023,10.1145/3530012,"Online games make up the largest segment of the booming global game market in terms of revenue as well as players. Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-Tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-Task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods.

How virtual reality influences travel intentions: The role of mental imagery and happiness forecasting,Skard S.; Knudsen E.S.; Sjåstad H.; Thorbjørnsen H.,2021,10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104360,"Virtual reality can influence consumer behavior in powerful ways, but in the domain of tourism marketing, less is known about the psychological process. One possibility is that VR has stronger impact on mental imagery than traditional channels, creating vivid simulations of what it would be like to visit destinations. This process might create hedonic expectations of future happiness, which should increase the willingness to actually seek out the destination in real life. The results from a laboratory experiment provided support to this hypothesis. Participants were randomly assigned to view a nature destination either in traditional still images or virtual reality, and then reported their initial responses before making an actual consumer choice. VR exposure led to higher levels of mental imagery and happiness predictions, which in turn was associated with stronger travel intentions and purchasing decisions. However, VR effects on consumer choice were moderated by previous experience with the destination. © 2021 The Authors",Affective forecasting; Behavioral intentions; Mental imagery; Purchase; Telepresence; Virtual reality,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-prediction
ESTIMATING THE DEMAND FOR RAILWAY FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION: A CASE STUDY IN KAZAKHSTAN,Sultanbek M.; Adilova N.; Sładkowski A.; Karibayev A.,2023,10.20858/tp.2023.18.3.07,"This article focuses on the critical importance of demand estimates for effective planning and decision-making in the railway freight transportation industry. Various departments within transportation companies, including marketing, production, distribution, and finance departments, heavily rely on accurate demand forecasts to make informed decisions. Forecasting demand is a crucial aspect of managing business processes, and the methods for doing this can vary across different industries. The ultimate goal remains consistent—to obtain precise predictions of future demand by analyzing historical data and current environmental factors. In the context of transportation services, accurate demand forecasting is essential for successful operational planning and management of functional areas such as transportation operations, marketing, and finance. The current case study specifically examines the National Company Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ), a transport and logistics holding engaged in rail transportation in Kazakhstan. KTZ’s main sources of income are related to freight transportation. The volume of cargo transportation (in tons) and the freight turnover play a significant role in assessing demand and forecasting future revenues from freight traffic. Different techniques for demand forecasting are explored, including qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods rely on judgments and opinions, while quantitative methods utilize historical data or identify causal relationships between variables. Overall, the present study highlights the critical role of demand forecasting in the railway freight transportation industry and its impact on efficient planning and decision-making processes. © 2023 Silesian University of Technology.

Attention Trajectories Capture Utility Accumulation and Predict Brand Choice,Martinovici A.; Pieters R.; Erdem T.,2023,10.1177/00222437221141052,"Trajectories of attention capture the accumulation of brand utility during complex decision-making tasks. Thus, attention trajectories, as reflected in eye movements, predict the final brand choice of 85% of consumers before they implement it. Even when observing eye movements in only the first quarter of the decision process, attention already predicts brand choice much better (45%) than chance levels (20%). This superior prediction performance is due to a “double attention lift” for the chosen brand: The chosen brand receives progressively more attention toward the moment of choice, and more of this attention is devoted to integrating information about the brand rather than to comparing it with other options. In contrast, the currently owned brand grabs attention early in the task, and its attention gain persists for brand-loyal consumers and shifts for brand-switching consumers. A new attention and choice model used in tandem with the Bayesian K-fold cross-validation methodology on eye-tracking data from 325 representative consumers uncovered these attention trajectory effects. The findings contribute to closing important knowledge gaps in the attention and choice literature and have implications for marketing research and managerial practice. © The Author(s) 2023.",attention and brand choice; Bayesian estimation; eye movements; K-fold cross-validation; prediction; utility accumulation,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-prediction
Principles of moral accounting: How our intuitive moral sense balances rights and wrongs,Johnson S.G.B.; Ahn J.,2021,10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104467,"We are all saints and sinners: Some of our actions benefit others, while other actions lead to harm. How do people balance moral rights against moral wrongs when evaluating others' actions? Across 9 studies, we contrast the predictions of three conceptions of intuitive morality—outcome-based (utilitarian), act-based (deontologist), and person-based (virtue ethics) approaches. These experiments establish four principles: Partial offsetting (good acts can partly offset bad acts), diminishing sensitivity (the extent of the good act has minimal impact on its offsetting power), temporal asymmetry (good acts are more praiseworthy when they come after harms), and act congruency (good acts are more praiseworthy to the extent they offset a similar harm). These principles are difficult to square with utilitarian or deontological approaches, but sit well within person-based approaches to moral psychology. Inferences about personal character mediated many of these effects (Studies 1–4), explained differences across items and across individuals (Studies 5–6), and could be manipulated to produce downstream consequences on blame (Studies 7–9); however, there was some evidence for more modest roles of utilitarian and deontological processing too. These findings contribute to conversations about moral psychology and person perception, and may have policy and marketing implications. © 2020",Intuitive ethics; Moral judgment; Person perception; Reputation; Social cognition,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction

EYE-TRACKING AS A PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW; [EYE-TRACKING COMO CORRELATO FISIOLÓGICO DO COMPORTAMENTO DO CONSUMIDOR: UMA REVISÃO SISTEMÁTICA DA LITERATURA],Neves Pereira M.H.; Bezerra de Melo F.L.N.; Jerônimo Soares A.M.; Soares Ferreira P.B.; da Silva M.P.; Morya E.,2024,10.5585/remark.v23i1.23271,"Objective: This study analyzes, through a systematic literature review, the main approaches used in research on consumer behavior that used eye-tracking as an identifier of physiological reactions. Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to identify and select empirical studies published in the last five years, between 2019 and 2023, in nine research databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, Emerald, Wiley Online, Sage, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar). Thus, 243 studies were included in the review. Results: The analyzed studies are mainly classified into four different themes of neuromarketing application: purchase decision, behavioral prediction, advertising effects, and customer retention. The main segments analyzed were e-commerce and retail. The predominance of quantitative studies and the need to control sociodemographic variables in the models is highlighted. In summary, there is a suggested need for more multimethod approaches that combine eye-tracking with quantitative and qualitative methods (retrospective interviews), as well as integrate it with other techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), facial biometrics, among others. Theoretical/Methodological Contributions: This research advances the understanding of the state of the art on eye-tracking and its application in neuromarketing, providing insights into methodological pathways.

"Persistence modeling for sales prediction: A simple, self-contained approach",Sbrana G.; Antonetti P.,2023,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114103,"The accurate prediction of future retail sales is crucial in business. Marketing persistence modeling is a well-established framework for the analysis of retail sales dynamics using a time series approach. However, dominant academic approaches to persistence modeling are rather complex, requiring sophisticated analytic and computing skills. We introduce a decision making approach that allows jointly testing and predicting the evolution of retail sales using a state-space model. We first propose a model, which incorporates the foundations of persistence modeling, and provide a simple estimation method. Secondly, we show a formal procedure for detecting persistence and, hence, selecting parameters to predict future data. An empirical investigation carried out over nearly 30000 Walmart retail sales, shows that our model provides significantly better prediction performance when compared to standard benchmarks. The combination of simplicity and efficiency makes our approach appealing not only for scholars but also for practitioners. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Marketing persistence; Model confident set; Prediction accuracy; State-space models,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-prediction
Reference dependent prices in bargaining: An experimental examination of precise first offers,Kimbrough E.O.; Porter D.; Schneider M.,2021,10.1016/j.joep.2021.102406,"Evidence from psychology and marketing suggests that those who make a “precise” first offer in bargaining get a better deal than those who make a “round” first offer. We report on a series of experiments designed to test for and improve our understanding of the “precise first offer” (PFO) effect in bargaining and whether it likely reflects rational optimizing or equilibrium behavior. Our experiment varies whether decisions are incentivized and whether the PFO effect can emerge as an equilibrium of a cheap-talk signaling game. We find evidence of a PFO effect when subjects read a vignette and make unincentivized individual decisions. When monetary incentives are added to the vignette, we still find the PFO effect, but it is not robust. In a bilateral bargaining situation with a cheap-talk equilibrium, we can not find the PFO effect, which is inconsistent with the equilibrium predictions. Moreover, the PFO effect reemerges in a setting in which initial offers are generated by a random device and thus provides a strong refutation of the signaling model. Our evidence suggests that optimizing and equilibrium accounts of the PFO effect are inadequate. Understanding initial offers as reference points, which subtly change perceptions about the kinds of acceptable counteroffers, provides a plausible account of a new finding on which prior explanations are silent: precise offers induce more precise counteroffers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bargaining; Precise first offers; Reference points,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction
A high-performance turnkey system for customer lifetime value prediction in retail brands: Forthcoming in quantitative marketing and economics,Yan Y.; Resnick N.,2024,10.1007/s11129-023-09272-x,"Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling underpins modern marketing analytics, enabling the development of tailored customer relationship management strategies based on the predicted future value of their customers. As part of Amperity’s enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing ”out of the box”. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns.

"Virtual vs physical platform: organizational capacity and slack, strategic decision and firm performance",Lee H.; Hsiao Y.-C.; Chen C.-J.; Guo R.-S.,2020,10.1108/JBIM-07-2019-0341,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between organizational capacity, slack resource, platform strategic choice and firm performance. It also tackles the endogenous issues regarding the strategic choice of platform types. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Heckman’s two-stage procedures to examine the relationship between the variables. The sample in this study comes from Compustat annual company and segment files. The sample used in the main analysis consists of 252 individual corporations globally and 3,528 firm-year observations from 2004–2017. Findings: The empirical results suggest that: (1) firms are more likely to develop physical platforms than virtual platforms when they possess higher levels of available slack, potential slack, research and development (R&D) capacity and marketing capacity; (2) in general, firms developing physical platforms perform better than firms developing virtual platforms after the endogeneity bias are controlled; and (3) firms that choose to develop physical platforms perform better than if they had chosen to develop virtual platforms. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the platform research literature by proposing the endogenous role of platform type choice in firm performance in the context of the retail industry. Prior conceptual and theoretical platform studies have seldom focused on the retail industry through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. This study also presents many opportunities for further explorations on the relationship between firm strategic choice and firm performance in the context of platform retail industry. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that firms must realize that their performance is not necessarily affected by these platform type choice determinants in terms of potential slack, available slack, R&D capacity and marketing capacity. By contrast, they should pay more attention to developing physical platforms if it is possible. The study findings indicate that although virtual platforms have grown rapidly because of the development of technology, firm performance is at all times superior when firms choose to develop physical platforms. Originality/value: Prior platform studies have focused on the topic of network structure, platform architecture, pricing strategy, platform leadership and platform design and governance within the context of video game industry, software industry, hardware industry and telecommunications industry. Seldom of them focus on other industries through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business strategy; Electronic commerce; Organizational capacity; Physical platform; Retail industry; Slack resource; Strategic management; Virtual platform,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction
A fuzzy approach to determining antecedents to green cosmetic consumption in India,Srivastava R.; Sanjeev M.A.; Gupta S.,2024,10.1108/IJRDM-09-2022-0340,"Purpose: Heightened public concerns for the global environment due to human overexploitation have given rise to many green product initiatives by businesses. Green cosmetics (GC) are products developed and marketed based on ecological sustainability and have shown increasing consumer appeal worldwide. The current research investigates the antecedents of green cosmetics consumption among Indian GC users, hitherto un-investigated comprehensively. Design/methodology/approach: The study is a cross-sectional pairwise comparison of green evaluation criteria for cosmetics using an expert panel of thirty Indian cosmetic users using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) and investigate the impact of a comprehensive list of antecedents on the multi-criteria category consumption decision. Findings: The study results indicate that perceived consumer effectiveness is the most critical factor for green cosmetics consumption in India, followed by brand trust, behavioural control, and environmental effectiveness. The least important factors are price and social norms. Research limitations/implications: As the GC category is at nascent stage in India the investigation is limited to the GC category innovators – a set of people high in intellectual and financial resources. The study is also limited to women users as the male cosmetic market in the country is still very small. Practical implications: The study results can help marketers in designing and implementing GC related marketing strategies to deliver higher customer value to the target segment. Academicians can use the study results for better prediction of category related behaviour of consumers. Social implications: The study results will help promote GC category adoption and usage which can benefit the environment and consumer health. Originality/value: The study contributes to literature and practice by assessing a comprehensive set of critical antecedents to GC adoption using a novel approach of F-AHP and an expert user panel. The study results offer insights to marketers that can be used to develop suitable strategies to convert non-GC users into GCs in India and similar markets, improving category penetration and benefitting marketers, retailers, users, and the environment. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Antecedents; Behavioral control; Brand trust; Consumer effectiveness; Environmental effectiveness; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Green cosmetics,Emerald Publishing,scopus-prediction
Analysis of FDA's Vuse market authorisation: limitations and opportunities,Meshnick A.B.; Faricy L.E.; Lushniak B.D.,2023,10.1136/tc-2022-057540,"This special communication provides a physicians' critique of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s decision to authorise the Vuse Solo (Vuse) Premarket Tobacco Application (PMTA). The PMTA authorisation represents the first time that FDA has authorised an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) for marketing in the USA. Using the FDA Decision Summary, the special communication identifies significant unanswered public health and scientific questions that prevent the authors from reaching FDA's conclusion that Vuse meets the Appropriate for the Protection of the Public Health (APPH) standard. The authors recommend FDA suspend the market authorisation and use these questions to re-evaluate the PMTA, and to prospectively monitor whether Vuse meets APPH standard. The special communication advances the ENDS harm reduction conversation because it calls for national tobacco regulators to develop an epidemiological prediction of ENDS impact on the population and to expand the scope of their analysis to evaluate the impacts of ENDS on congenital birth defects, abuse liability and non-flavour drivers of youth usage.

Impact of International Trade on the Share Prices of the Industrial Bank of Korea Using Stochastic Prediction Modeling,Dar G.F.; Ahn Y.-H.; Dar Q.F.; Ma J.-H.,2023,10.20294/jgbt.2023.19.4.90,"Purpose – The share price of any financial institution fluctuates due to various hidden and visible factors. Predicting share price behavior in the economy and financial marketing theory is crucial but complex. The Industrial Bank of Korea’s (IBK) share prices are also affected by hidden factors, including Korean international trade flow. The study aims to forecast hidden impacts on IBK share prices resulting from the international trade flow in Korea. Design/Methodology/Approach – Two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approaches are employed, one based on exports, and the other on imports, to identify trends and fluctuations in the hidden states influencing visible states. Findings – The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between IBK share prices and both exports and imports. Notably, increasing exports indicate a 50% probability of IBK share prices rising, while falling imports indicate a 56% chance of IBK share prices increasing. These results demonstrate how changes in exports and imports impact IBK’s share price in the Korean stock market. Research Implications – The research implications are valuable for short-and long-term investors in IBK shares and the Korean stock exchange.

Money-Back Guarantees and Service Quality: The Marketing of In Vitro Fertilization Services,Yu S.; Ghosh M.; Viswanathan M.,2022,10.1177/00222437211060733,"Marketing practices like money-back guarantees (MBGs) are prevalent in many expert-service markets but are often decried as marketing gimmicks that take advantage of vulnerable and poorly informed consumers. In this research, conducted in the market for in vitro fertilization services, the authors empirically assess differences in quality of care between clinics that offer MBG programs and those that don't, to investigate whether MBG programs can serve a purpose consistent with signaling and insurance theories. The analysis is conducted on a unique longitudinal data set that includes information on clinic-level treatment, outcome statistics, clinic characteristics, and marketing practices for fertility clinics in the United States, state-level insurance mandates, competition environments, and demographic and geographic characteristics. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogeneity of MBG decisions made by fertility clinics, the authors find that MBG clinics, on average, offer better treatment outcomes in terms of success rates while undertaking lower risks. The results are consistent with signaling theory predictions that market-based programs like MBGs can serve as signals of unobservable clinic quality despite the incentives for clinics to engage in opportunistic behaviors. © American Marketing Association 2022.",expert services; health care marketing; in vitro fertilization; information asymmetry; insurance; money-back guarantees; quality of care; signaling,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-prediction
Order in multi-attribute product choice decisions: Evidence from discrete choice experiments combined with eye tracking,Zuschke N.,2023,10.1002/bdm.2320,"Over time, research on order effects during information searching and choice tasks has received thorough attention in marketing, psychology, and economics. When early information search influences choice in favor of that information, it is called primacy; the equivalent for later information search is called recency. However, research that disentangles primacy and recency effects during multi-attribute product choice, as well as studies on the cognitive processes underlying primacy and recency effects are lacking. I address this gap with two choice-based conjoint experiments combined with eye tracking and by means of multilevel mediation analysis. Consistent with my prediction that to counterbalance the impact of decision irrelevant information on choice through early information search by later information search is mentally too costly, I find that “spatial position” biases choice due to primacy rather than recency. This bias, however, is small. This suggests that for decision irrelevant information, the causal influence of attention on choice generalizes to more complex decisions, though with little impact. Consistent with my prediction that the level of information elaboration moderates the mediation process, increasing task motivation decreases the dominance of primacy. © 2023 The Author.

"Performance shortfall, managerial ability and firms′ patenting strategy: An analysis of the tension between quantity and quality; [绩效下跌、管理者能力与企业专利战略: 对专利数量和质量之间张力的分析]",Peng D.,2023,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2023.05.002,"The behavioral theory of the firm is an important fundamental theory in the management domain. It describes the strategic decision-making process of a firm as a performance feedback process and argues that performance shortfall, i. e., firms′ failing to achieve their aspirations, would make decision makers launch problemistic search to seek solutions to settling the problem of performance shortfall, consequently leading to organizational changes. Previous studies have established theoretical relationship between performance shortfalls and various kinds of organizational changes. However, no consensus has been reached about the effect of performance shortfalls. On one hand, many studies support the classic predictions of the behavioral theory of the firm and it′s found that performance shortfalls would lead to organizational changes of the firm. On the other hand, some studies indicate contrary evidence that performance shortfalls would reduce firms′ tendency to make organizational changes. This study holds that the way a firm responds to performance shortfall depends on decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfall and on the characteristics of that organizational change. To make up for the research gap described above, this study incorporates managerial ability into the behavioral theory of the firm and focuses on the quantity and the quality of firms′ patent applications with inherent tension. Specifically, this study examines how performance shortfall influences firms′ patenting strategies involving the quantity and the quality of patent applications and how managerial ability moderates the relationships between performance shortfall and patenting strategies. This study investigates managerial ability, because it would influence the performance feedback process of the two patenting strategies by altering decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfalls. This study focuses on firms′ patenting strategies for the following reasons. First, patenting strategies are common and important strategies for manufacturing firms to respond to performance shortfalls. Second, there is often a tension between the quantity and the quality of patent applications; therefore, decision makers have to weigh up those two options. Investigating the performance feedback processes of them may reveal the different effects of performance shortfall on organizational changes. This study uses a sample of Chinese A-share manufacturing listed firms in the period of 2011—2017. The data used in this study are from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR) and Wind Database (WIND), which have been widely employed in empirical studies on Chinese firms. To alleviate the potential effect of outliers, this study winsorizes variables with possible outliers at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their distributions. This study employs fixed effect models for panel data to test hypotheses. Fixed effect models can solve the problem that the explanatory variables are correlated with unobserved individual effects. This study uses Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to correct the problems of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation. The measurement of the quantity of patent applications is natural logarithm for the total number of patent applications of a firm. The quality of patent applications is measured as the ratio of the number of invention patent applications to the total number of patent applications. Performance shortfall means performance falls below the aspiration level. This study uses return on assets (ROA) to measure firm performance and focuses on social aspiration. Social aspiration is the average performance of all the other firms in focal firm′s industry. This study uses two-step data envelopment analysis (DEA) to obtain the measurement of managerial ability. As to control variables, this study controls R&D intensity, marketing intensity, unabsorbed slack resources, firm size, income tax ratio, the independence of the board, the size of top management team, ownership concentration, proportion of state-owned shares, positive performance discrepancy, industry dummy variables, and year dummy variables. This study suggests that there is a negative relationship between performance shortfalls and the quantity of patent applications so that the more the performance falls short of the performance aspiration, the smaller the quantity of patent applications would be. In addition, managerial ability would undermine this negative relationship. Moreover, there is a positive relationship between performance shortfalls and the quality of patent applications so that the more the performance falls below the performance aspiration, the higher the quality of patent applications would be, and managerial ability would strengthen this positive relationship. © (2023).

The effect of shopping channel (online vs offline) on consumer decision process and firm's marketing strategy,Xu C.; Park J.; Lee J.C.,2022,10.1108/INTR-11-2020-0660,"Purpose: This research investigates the novel questions of whether and how specific forms of shopping channels (online vs offline) influence consumers' decision-making. Moreover, this research investigates marketing firms' proper marketing strategies across different shipping channels. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted three studies using a large sample (N = 703) recruited from a diverse pool (students and adults) that examined multiple products (camera and car) across different shopping channels (online vs offline). Study 1a (n = 251) and Study 1b (n = 252) examined the effect of an online versus offline channel on consumers' decision-making using a one-factor (shopping channel: online vs offline) between-subjects design. Meanwhile, Study 2 (n = 200) investigated the effective strategies that firms should employ across different shopping channels using a 2 (shopping channel: online vs offline) × 2 (mental simulation: outcome vs process) between-subjects design. Participants in the online condition evaluated the product on a computer screen, whereas participants in the offline condition evaluated the real product assuming a real-world retail store setting. Findings: The three studies supported the predictions that shopping channels (online vs offline) affect consumers' psychological distance and, in turn, affect their decision process. Specifically, results reveal that the online (offline) channel increases (decreases) psychological distance and leads consumers to pay more attention to a product's desirability (feasibility) aspects.

However, existing approaches face difficulties analyzing consumer preferences over different attributes of alternatives (restaurants, hotels, etc.), which hinders product/service providers from comprehensively understanding consumer choice decisions. To address this issue, we solve for the consumer preferences over the attributes represented by attribute weights based on consumers’ historical data, including text comments and overall ratings. Specifically, for each comment and a corresponding rating, we first employ sentiment analysis to calculate values of the attributes, and then develop a quadratic programming model to solve for the weights. Based on a stream of a consumer's text comments and overall ratings, we can correspondingly obtain a stream of weights indexed by the comment time. We then model this stream of weights as hesitant judgments and employ a hesitant multiplicative programming method to solve for the final weights that fit the consumer's preferences over attributes at the highest satisficing level. In the application of recommendation, our approach not only provides insights into the consumer's preferences but also has higher prediction power compared with some state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer preference; Decision analysis; Hesitant judgment; Pairwise comparisons; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction
Share of purchases in B2B: relative customer satisfaction indicators and customer characteristics as main influencers,Alet Vilaginés J.,2023,10.1108/JBIM-05-2021-0274,"Purpose: This study aims to identify a new model of relative customer satisfaction translated into share of purchases (SOP) with the best-related metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an online customer satisfaction survey to clients of a firm and with a comparative valuation with current competitors by customer. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis, obtaining β for each variable by relating the variables to the SOP, presenting the relative effect of the variables and the best global explanation of the model. Findings: This new model has good prediction accuracy and shows a clear impact of different relative satisfaction indicators and, to a minor degree, business and relationship characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this model is that it is based on data from only one company, but it should have value in other sectors and provide full insight through its transversal application. Originality/value: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers and determined how the improvements in customer satisfaction translate into business growth. The study shows that the relative evaluation of satisfaction carries different meanings for customers, while all of them are better than absolute satisfaction. It includes a more understandable indicator than other prior relative indicators, the difference in satisfaction and is more effective. Additionally, it guides how to take advantage of the knowledge of relative customer satisfaction before competitors and demonstrates the courses of action with the potential best results. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business-to-business marketing; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction model; Customer strategy; Share of purchases; Share of wallet,Emerald Publishing,scopus-prediction
A neurobehavioral account of differential consumer responses to price and in-store display between un/healthy food,Labban A.; Ma Y.; Dube L.,2021,10.1108/EJM-07-2020-0565,"Purpose: This paper aims to elucidate some of the complexity around food consumption by drawing from neuroscience research of food as a motivated choice (i.e. a neurobehavioral process sensitive to dopaminergic response to food and environmental cues such as marketing). The authors explore the single and compounded effect of the motivational salience of food’s intrinsic reinforcing value tied to its sugar content and that of two marketing food cues, price and in-store display, on actual consumer purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above hypotheses in two perceived “healthy” product categories with a wide distribution of sugar content. The authors estimate a within-category model using three years of retail transaction data to test the effect on weekly sales. Findings: The authors confirm the single effect of each of food’s and marketing cues’ motivational salience as well as their compounded effect with high-motivational-salience food being less price elastic and more susceptible to in-store display activities. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the need to complement current reliance on unhealthy/healthy perception with finer grained objective evidence linked to the formulation of the food itself and the marketing applied to them. Practical implications: The present study findings may help marketing managers and policymakers develop better targeted pricing and display strategies for low- and high-motivational-salience food, attempting to strike a better balance between consumer welfare and commercial performance. Originality/value: This paper is one of the few that links real-world market outcomes to predictions derived from a unique combination of consumer neuroscience and neurobiology of food, advancing data-driven decisions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer neuroscience; Food preference; Merchandising; Pricing; Public policy,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction
“012012 or 111000”: preference for consumption pattern-seeking,Kim J.; Cui Y.; Hwang E.; Franklin D.; Seo Y.,2020,10.1108/EJM-03-2019-0224,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine how consumers make choices when they are faced with a fixed set of available options, consisting of both preferred and less-preferred choices, in the domain of food consumption. Specifically, the paper offers a novel perspective to predict repeated choice decisions in food consumption, which is termed as “pattern-seeking” – a consumption choice pattern that involves a coherent repetitive sequence of sub-groupings or coherently concentrated sub-groupings of options. Design/methodology/approach: Eight experimental studies that contrast the existing theoretical predictions regarding repeated choices (e.g. primacy effect, recency effect, variety vs consistency) against pattern-seeking were conducted using hypothetical and actual food choices. Findings: The results of experimental studies show that an explicit decision pattern (i.e. pattern-seeking) emerges as the most significant predictor of repeated choice in the food consumption domain. Research limitations/implications: This study offers a novel perspective on how consumers make repeated choices in the domain of food consumption. Practical implications: The results show that consumers prefer food consumption with a pattern (vs non-pattern). Thus, it would be better to generate marketing activities that allow customers to satisfy their pattern-seeking more easily. Originality/value: This study advances the literature on repeated food choices by demonstrating that people possess an inherent preference for patterns in food consumption. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer preference; Decision-making; Food consumption; Pattern seeking; Repeated choices,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction

Consumers can learn and can forget – Modeling the dynamic decision procedure when watching TV,Song L.; Fai Tso G.K.,2020,10.1016/j.jmse.2020.05.002,"Facing the challenge of attracting consumers and winning market share under the proliferation of TV stations and channels, the traditional TV stations often make some marketing strategies. However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies. Managerial implications are then discussed to guide the decision-making of traditional TV broadcasters and advertisers. © 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Bayesian updating theory; Dynamic learning; Forgetting; Marketing strategy evaluation,KeAi Communications Co.,scopus-prediction
Uplift modeling and its implications for B2B customer churn prediction: A segmentation-based modeling approach,De Caigny A.; Coussement K.; Verbeke W.; Idbenjra K.; Phan M.,2021,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.10.001,"Business-to-business (B2B) customer retention relies heavily on analytics and predictive modeling to support decision making. Given this, we introduce uplift modeling as a relevant prescriptive analytics tool. In particular, the uplift logit leaf model offers a segmentation-based algorithm that combines predictive performance with interpretability. Applied to a real-world data set of 6432 customers of a European software provider, the uplift logit leaf model achieves superior performance relative to three other popular uplift models in our study. The accessibility of output gained from the uplift logit leaf model also is showcased with a case study, which reveals relevant managerial insights. This new tool thus delivers novel insights in the form of customized, global, and segment-level visualizations that are especially pertinent to industrial marketing settings. Overall, the findings affirm the viability of uplift modeling for improving decisions related to B2B customer retention management. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Churn prediction; Customer retention; Interpretability; Segmentation-based modeling; Uplift modeling; Visualization,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-prediction
A decision support system based on machined learned Bayesian network for predicting successful direct sales marketing,Hosseini S.,2021,10.1080/23270012.2021.1897956,"This paper proposes a decision support system based on a machine-learned Bayesian network (BN) to predict the success rate of telemarketing calls for long-term bank deposits. Telemarketing is one of the most common interactive techniques of direct marketing, widely used by financial institutions such as banks to sell long-term deposits. In this study, we develop a BN model that predicts the likelihood that a potential client subscribes to a long-term deposit, which is considered an output variable. The causal relationship among client attributes and outcomes has been identified using the augmented Naïve Bayes approach, a well-known supervised learning algorithm. The impact of each client's attribute on the likelihood of subscribing is predicted. Further, we carry out multiple simulation scenarios using BN’s unique features (forward and backward propagation) to provide more in-depth discussions and analysis on predicting the likelihood of subscription for clients with particular characteristics. © 2021 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",decision making; decision support system; prediction; sales marketing,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-prediction
Competition for context-sensitive consumers,Apffelstaedt A.; Mechtenberg L.,2021,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3675,"When preferences are sensitive to context, firms may influence purchase decisions by designing the environment of consumption choices. This paper studies how competitive retailers optimally design their product line if preferences at the store depend on whether the choice set draws consumer attention to the quality or price of a product. Before making a purchase decision, a consumer chooses among retailers without (fully) anticipating that her preferences at the store are malleable. We show that this setup can align evidence on retailer marketing practices and the existence of loss leaders with the experimental literature on decoy effects: in equilibrium, retailers use loss leaders to attract the consumer to the store and decoy products to draw consumer attention at the store to more profitable alternatives featuring a higher price (inducing a profitable upsell) or lower production cost (inducing a profitable downsell). We embed and compare the predictions of three recent specifications of choice-set dependent attention - namely, Salience, Focusing, and Relative Thinking. All three specifications predict that firms construct choice environments that utilize decoy effects to up- or downsell the consumer. Because they differ in how attention can be directed using the product line, however, they differ in their predictions of how the decoy will be positioned in the price-quality space.  © 2020 INFORMS.",Context; Decoys; Downselling; Focusing; Naïveté; Relative thinking; Retailer competition; Salience; Upselling,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Platform Service Offering to Business Customers: Strategic Considerations in Engendering Seller Use of Marketing Tools,Yang B.; Yang S.; Dutta S.,2022,10.1287/mksc.2021.1325,"Many e-commerce platforms provide marketing tools to help their sellers attract customers and enhance user experience. However, there is virtually no theoretical framework or systematic evidence that provides insights to platforms on how their business customers use these marketing tools. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework and apply it to an empirical setting to understand how business customers choose between two service offerings (paid search and hot shop) provided by an e-commerce platform. A unique aspect of our modeling framework is that we incorporate two types of heterogeneous strategic considerations in sellers’ choice decisions of marketing tools: competitor and consumer reactions. To capture seller consideration of competition, we adapt the cognitive hierarchy framework by modeling sellers’ differing abilities to predict how competition affects their decisions. To capture seller consideration of consumer response, we first specify a sales-response model in which sales are affected by the marketing tools used and then incorporate the response parameters in sellers’ payoff functions. Our empirical analysis indicates that these two types of strategic considerations are both important. Our estimation results show that, in making decisions on which marketing tool(s) to use, sellers tend to differentiate themselves from the competition. We also find that sellers with a higher rating tend to be more strategic. This finding provides a useful metric associated with firms’ strategic ability, which is often difficult to quantify, and helps researchers to test theoretical predictions related to firms’ strategic thinking using field data. We perform two comparative statics exercises to derive managerial insights. The first exercise offers a benchmark analysis to help platforms evaluate which targeted promotion strategies are most effective. The second exercise indicates that an increase in seller strategic ability would reduce the overall seller usage of marketing tools, and we offer specific suggestions to help platform managers increase the use of their marketing tools. © 2021 INFORMS.",behavioral economics; business-to-business marketing; choice modeling; cognitive hierarchy; competition; competitive analysis; electronic commerce; marketing tools; sales response parameters,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Optimal combinations of factors influencing the sustainability of Taiwanese firms,Lo F.-Y.; Wong W.-K.; Geovani J.,2021,10.1108/IJOEM-02-2020-0205,"Purpose: The authors aim to obtain the optimal combinations of factors from institutional environment adaptation mechanisms and internal resources or capabilities that influence the sustainability of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a new index, called the sustainability index, based on the stakeholder perspective by employing a corporate credit risk index, an evaluation of a firm's corporate governance, corporate financial performance and firm age. The authors then apply both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Analysis and Fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (FsQCA) to obtain the optimal models for firms' sustainability. Findings: The OLS analysis shows that the variables including financial leverage, slack, innovation capability, manufacturing capability and human capital that have significant influences on the sustainability of firms. Our FsQCA analysis obtains configurations of several solutions for firm sustainability and concludes that the fit of combinations of institutional factors and/or internal resources and capabilities of a firm is related to its sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The limitations in our new index include these: first, one may add more key metrics to measure the index; second, the findings do not provide any necessary nor a sufficient condition to get sustainability for sure. The limitations of using multiple regression analysis are that it is not able to reveal the combinations of causal conditions that can lead to the outcome in the real world as well as to the sustainability of a firm in our study. To overcome the limitations, the authors apply fsQCA analysis to identify combinations of causal conditions to a firm's sustainability in our study. Practical implications: Introducing the sustainability index enables us to find out all factors influencing the sustainability of a firm. The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world. Their analysis enables managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. For example, the authors’ fsQCA analysis shows that low marketing capability will lead to the high sustainability of the firm. This information helps managers to make the decision or plan to achieve good results toward their businesses and get better allocate their resources and get a better investment. Social implications: The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world and enable managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. A correct prediction can assist companies in developing their future operations, which would enhance their competitiveness vis-à-vis rivals during this time of global economic volatility, which, in turn, enables firms to perform better and employ more employees that could help the entire society. Originality/value: The sustainability index the authors developed in our paper is new in the literature and the findings obtained by both OLS Regression Analysis and FsQCA are new in predicting a firm's sustainability.

Algorithms and heuristics of health technology assessments: A retrospective analysis of factors associated with HTA outcomes for new drugs across seven OECD countries,Kanavos P.; Visintin E.; Gentilini A.,2023,10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116045,"Context: Positive health technology assessment (HTA) outcomes can have important implications for equity, efficiency and timely patient access to novel therapies. Several outcomes and dimensions of benefit beyond utility feed into HTA processes. Objective: We analyse a proprietary dataset of HTA outcomes in 7 countries, to (a) test whether HTA decision-making is grounded in welfarist or extra-welfarist approaches; and (b) empirically determine the factors associated with positive HTA outcomes, the time to achieve these and establish the magnitude of inter-country differences in assessment processes. Methods: Data were extracted from publicly available HTA reports on drugs that received marketing authorisation between 2009 and 2018 (N = 1415). The outcomes of interest were the probability of positive HTA outcomes and the time-to-HTA outcome; these were examined with respect to clinical, regulatory, product- and disease-related, evidence uncertainty and contextual variables. Econometric models utilising survival analysis and multinomial logistic regression were specified. Findings: Positive HTA outcomes accounted for 87.3% of the sample (n = 1235), of which 71% (n = 1004) were restricted. Drugs with positive HTA outcomes were subject to clinical restrictions (n = 652, 46%), financial risk-sharing (n = 439, 31%) or had been rejected at least once (n = 282, 20%). Significant predictors of positive HTA outcomes were orphan drugs with cancer indications, high quality of evidence linked to clinical and economic evidence uncertainties which had been overcome, and contextual considerations, particularly innovativeness and unmet need. Comparative analyses revealed systematic differences between countries in their propensity to accept the same drugs, particularly oncology and orphan drugs. Conclusions: Our results are contextual and reinforce arguments in favour of explicitly accounting for social value judgements, establishing separate assessment frameworks for highly uncertain products, adopting risk mitigation strategies for novel therapies with early phase evidence, and sharing of HTA practices across settings. Lastly, HTA agencies have adopted an extra-welfarist approach to value assessment and resource allocation. © 2023 The Authors",Affordability; Cost-effectiveness; Drug pricing; Extra-welfarism; Health technology assessment; Priority setting; Social value judgements; Uncertainty,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-prediction
Predicting online customer purchase: The integration of customer characteristics and browsing patterns,Kim S.; Shin W.; Kim H.-W.,2024,10.1016/j.dss.2023.114105,"Despite the relentless growth of online retail, e-commerce platforms still suffer from a low purchase conversion rate. Researchers and practitioners have attempted to understand customer purchase behavior, but it remains elusive due to customers' heterogeneous and complex decision-making processes. This study addresses a gap in existing research by combining two types of factors affecting purchase behavior: past customer characteristics and current website browsing behavior.

Cause-related marketing and the effect of 99-ending pricing,Jaber M.; Jaber K.,2020,10.1108/JCM-12-2018-2993,"Purpose: Cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns have become common features of the marketplace. CRM often involves a for-profit business agreeing to contribute a specified amount to a cause when the business’s customers engage in revenue-generating exchanges. Despite the central role that price is likely to play in a consumer’s decision to purchase or not to purchase an offer associated with a CRM campaign, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, very few have examined price framing effects in a CRM context. This paper aims to explore the effect of rightmost digits manipulation in prices on participation intentions for CRM campaigns. Design/methodology/approach: In Study 1, 241 college students participated in an online experiment for class credit. The experiment used a 3 (price level: low, medium and high) × 2 (price ending: 99 ending and no ending) between-subjects design. The dependent variable was participation intention, and several moderators and mediators were considered. PROCESS was used to test the moderated mediation. In Study 2, 351 subjects participated in an online experiment with a design similar to the earlier study. In Study 2, however, new mediators were added and the moderated mediation was tested using SPSS PROCESS macro. Findings: This research shows that price ending impacts the effectiveness of CRM as a tactic on consumers’ purchase intentions. Consistent with the authors’ prediction, this study shows that consumers exposed to a 99-ending CRM offer are more likely to participate in the offer compared to consumers exposed to a no-ending priced offer. Offer attractiveness, elaboration and corporate social responsibility were also shown to have a strong effect on participation intentions. Practical implications: This research indicates that for moderately priced products, 99-ending prices led to an increased influence on consumer purchase intentions; on the other hand, no-ending/even-ending prices were more effective for high-priced products. Thus, the use of the right digit effect by managers in a CRM context as way of increasing consumers’ participation likelihood is likely to be more successful for moderately priced offers. Originality/value: This research extends previous work on CRM and right digit effect in pricing. This study’s findings, in both Studies 1 and 2, demonstrate that the effectiveness of CRM campaigns on consumer choice is dependent on the offer price ending. Consumers exposed to the no-ending priced CRM offers tend to be affected less by CRM campaigns compared to consumers exposed to 99-ending offers, who perceive the offer as more attractive. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",99 ending; Cause-related marketing; Framing; Pricing; Right digit effect,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction
A Novel Hybrid Forecasting Approach for Customers Churn in Banking Industry,Rouhani S.; Mohammadi A.,2023,10.1142/S0219649222500897,"Competitive markets and customers' changing needs in the bank industry necessitate accurately predicting customers who may leave the firm in the near future. Consequently, creating an approach to predict precisely and identify churn-leading causes is a part of retention strategies in customer relationship management. The approach that has been utilized in this research to predict customer churn combines decision tree (DT) and multinomial regression (MR) to classify customers with no limitation of binary classification in the churn prediction context. A customer club dataset of a commercial bank case as a real churn problem is used in this study to benchmark the hybrid forecasting approach against its building blocks. The results showed that the hybrid forecasting approach outperformed DT and MR with an average accuracy of 87.66%, 90.74% micro-average, and 90.44% macro-average of AUC. Further analysis of the model performance per class indicated that the hybrid approach's misclassification error for the churn class decreased significantly, which is the most costly error in churn problems. Moreover, due to the structure of hybrid forecasting approach, more interoperability is obtained by assessing the impact of features in different segments, resulting in transforming them into actionable insights. The proposed approach is applied to the banking industry to prevent financial loss by detecting leading churn causes. Accordingly, after predicting the risk of customer churn, marketers and managers can determine appropriate actions that will have the most significant retention impact on each customer by applying proactive retention marketing. © World Scientific Publishing Co.",banking industry; Churn prediction; Customer Churn; decision tree; hybrid approach,World Scientific,scopus-prediction
Pricing decisions of consumer innovators,Ebbing T.; Lüthje C.,2021,10.1016/j.respol.2020.104169,"Increasing numbers of consumers who engage in the development of new products are selling their innovations on online marketplaces. We contribute to the scarce research on the commercialization activities of consumer innovators by comparing the consumers’ price decisions with the pricing of firms. Our predictions build on the baseline assumption that the price decisions of consumers are influenced by the same motivations that originally prompt them to innovate. We use a sequential mixed-method approach with a quantitative main study and follow-up qualitative research. The quantitative results draw on a matched-pair analysis of 4,242 computer games released on the online game platform Steam. We find that consumer innovators charge lower prices than firms for comparable games and that consumers and firms show different inclinations in aligning prices with the games’ development costs and perceived quality. The subsequent interview study with 29 hobbyist game developers provides clear support for the motivational explanations of consumers’ pricing decisions. The findings contribute to research on consumer innovation marketing and nascent entrepreneurship. They also improve the understanding of welfare effects resulting from increasing commercial activities of consumers. © 2020",Computer games; Consumer innovators; Innovation; Marketplaces; Pricing; User innovation,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction
Strategic decisions for sustainable management at significant tourist sites,Mackay R.M.; Minunno R.; Morrison G.M.,2020,10.3390/su12218988,"This research explores how tourist site management and human attitudes and behaviours can help decrease the pressure of tourism on the environment. Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site. Lastly, tourism bodies and businesses could increase their partnerships with local custodians to add cultural value and understand the visitor experience. © 2020 by the authors.

To help businesses understand their current and future performance, which can help them survive and thrive in the world of e-commerce, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that conducts performance prediction and evaluation of the e-commerce industry by combining the Grey model, i.e., GM (1, 1) and data envelopment analysis, i.e., the Malmquist-I-C model. For each e-commerce company, GM (1, 1) is applied to predict future values for the period 2020–2022 and Malmquist-I-C is applied to calculate the efficiency score based on output variables such as revenue and gross profit and input variables such as assets, liabilities, and equity. The top 10 e-commerce companies in the US market are used to demonstrate model effectiveness. For the entire research period of 2016–2022, the most productive e-commerce marketplace on average was eBay, followed by Best Buy and Lowe’s; meanwhile, Groupon was the worst-performing e-commerce business during the studied period. Moreover, as most e-commerce companies have progressed in technological development, the results show that the determinants for productivity growth are the technical efficiency change indexes. That means, although focusing on technology development is the key to e-commerce success, companies should make better efforts to maximize their resources such as labor, material and equipment supplies, and capital. This paper offers decision-makers significant material for evaluating and improving their business performance. © 2020 by the authors.

The duality of decisions and the case for impulsiveness metrics,Arens Z.G.; Rust R.T.,2012,10.1007/s11747-011-0256-3,"Customer metrics help firms manage their performance and predict financial outcomes. While many firms focus on customer satisfaction metrics for this purpose, dual-process theories in psychology and neuroscience show that customer decisions are based on two processes. This suggests that metrics which measure the impulsiveness of purchase decisions might effectively complement customer satisfaction metrics. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics make distinct but strong predictions of consumer choices. Satisfaction and impulsiveness influence choice in different ways. While impulsiveness relates to choice directly, the satisfaction-choice path is mediated by loyalty intention. Moreover this relationship is moderated by product involvement such that impulsiveness metrics provide a better prediction for low-involvement than for high-involvement situations. Finally, a field study of 750 customers of 101 firms demonstrates these relationships at a firm level, indicating that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics have equally strong but distinct relationships with shareholder value. Therefore firms may be able to benefit from complementing customer satisfaction metrics with customer impulsiveness metrics. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.",Customer metrics; Customer satisfaction; Financial impact; Impulsiveness,,scopus-prediction
Do Professional Reviews Affect Online User Choices Through User Reviews? An Empirical Study,Zhou W.; Duan W.,2016,10.1080/07421222.2016.1172460,"With the broad reach of the Internet, online users frequently resort to various word-of-mouth (WOM) sources, such as online user reviews and professional reviews, during online decision making. Although prior studies generally agree on the importance of online WOM, we have little knowledge of the interplay between online user reviews and professional reviews. This paper empirically investigates a mediation model in which online user reviews mediate the impact of professional reviews on online user decisions. Using software download data, we show that a higher professional rating not only directly promotes software download but also results in more active user-generated WOM interactions, which indirectly lead to more downloads. The indirect impact of professional reviews can be as large as 20 percent of the corresponding total impact. These findings deepen our understanding of online WOM effect, and provide managerial suggestions about WOM marketing and the prediction of online user choices.

Price customization and within-chain data do not mix!,Niraj R.; Siddarth S.,2014,10.1108/EJM-01-2012-0032,"Purpose: Grocery retailers have access to detailed data on consumer purchases within their own chains. Previous research has used across-chain scanner panel data to develop optimal price cuts targeted to individual households but whether such a targeting strategy will work with only within-chain data is unknown. The purpose of this research is to address this specific question. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use scanner panel data from multiple categories to create across-chain and within-chain purchase histories for the same consumers. They then estimate models of purchase decisions on the two datasets and compare their performance. Findings: Within-chain data fares significantly worse on both fit and prediction criteria. Retailers' upside to customizing is minimal compared to those reported for manufacturers. Finally, customized prices based on the within-chain model significantly underperform the promise of across-chain data. Research limitations/implications: Store choice is not modelled. Research also needs to be replicated in other contexts. The authors conclude that limited purchase histories may not yield accurate enough estimates of marketing mix responsiveness, and that across-chain purchase histories are essential for effective targeted price cuts. Practical implications: Loyalty card data may be useful for other purposes, like experimenting with segment-specific discounts, but its value in customizing prices at individual level is limited without adding other sources of information. Originality/value: Previous research on price customization has been based almost exclusively on across-store data. However, retailers only have access to their own chain-specific data. This is the first study to comprehensively compare price customization based on within- and across-chain purchase data and show that the upside potential for price customization based on the former information set is quite limited. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",and quantity models; choice; Incidence; Loyalty cards; Retailing; Scanner panel data; Targeted price cuts,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-prediction
Rate of adoption determinants of innovations: A case study of digital terrestrial television,Vejlgaard H.,2018,10.1386/jdtv.9.1.7_1,"The rate of adoption of digital terrestrial television in Denmark was 100 per cent. In this article, an interdisciplinary approach is utilized to investigate this successful rate of adoption. Diffusion of innovation theory as well as services marketing theory and recent research on adoption of technology are integrated into the theoretical approach. The data gathering is twofold: a survey on the perceived attributes of the innovation was carried out and document data were gathered from government sources. This study shows that a 100 per cent rate of adoption can be achieved with (1) negative perception of the attributes of the innovation; (2) an authority innovation-decision; (3) use of mass communication and interpersonal communication channels; (4) communication in social networks that are not interconnected; and (5) active change agents on a comprehensive and large scale.

Joint consumption challenges in groups,Marchand A.,2014,10.1108/JCM-06-2014-1001,"Purpose – This study aims to develop a new general framework of the challenges for decision making in groups. Unlike most research focused on individual consumption, this study takes a broader perspective on joint consumption. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework and the developed research questions are based on an extensive literature review. Findings – This research identifies five major challenges for group decisions: allocation of responsibilities, preference prediction, preference aggregation, conflicts and mutual influences. For each challenge, this study summarizes existing findings and highlights important areas for continued investigation, related to a marketing-oriented understanding of consumers. This article concludes with implications for both managers and researchers. Originality/value – The identified key determinants of group decisions aggregate findings from multidisciplinary literature and can help marketing researchers and managers understand the relevant but underresearched issues of decision making in groups. Furthermore, this study includes relevant moderators, such as individual and group characteristics, and reveals problematic research gaps.

Decision costs and price sensitivity: Field experimental evidence from India,Spears D.,2014,10.1016/j.jebo.2013.06.012,"Poor people often exhibit puzzlingly high sensitivity to low prices of important consumer health goods. This paper proposes decision costs as one explanation: whether a person buys at a price depends on whether she carefully considers the offer, which itself depends on price. A simple model predicts that deliberation costs (1) increase sensitivity to low prices; (2) can prevent cost-sharing from targeting products to buyers with high value; and (3) can have larger effects on poorer people. The principal contribution of this paper is a field experiment that sold hand-washing soap in rural India. Participants were randomly assigned to be offered soap for either a low or very low price, which was experimentally crossed with assignment to a control group or to a treatment that required deliberation. Results matched predictions of the model: the treatment decreased price sensitivity relative to the control group, and increased targeting of product take-up by need. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioral economics; Cognitive limits; Cost sharing; Deliberation costs; Development economics; Field experiment; Handwashing with soap; Pricing; Social marketing,,scopus-prediction
A Relationship Governance Perspective of Organizational Buyers' Supplier Choice Decisions,Gao T.,2017,10.1080/15332667.2017.1357522,"Although the transaction cost analysis (TCA) has long been used by marketing and management scholars to study organizational buyers' make-or-buy decisions, it sheds limited light on their choice behavior beyond the make-or-buy trade-off. In the meantime, many organizational purchase decisions are structured around which independent supplier to buy from, rather than a typical make-or-buy decision. This study extends existing research on TCA by applying this theoretical framework to explore why organizational buyers make purchases from among independent suppliers. The article posits that (1) two forms of relationship governance—buyer trust and market (i.e., the relative dependence between the buyer and supplier)—help explain the differences in buyer decision-making uncertainty involving independent suppliers, which further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase; and that (2) trust further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase due to its effect on customer perceived value. The empirical study based on organizational purchasing decisions lends support to the predictions of the relationship governance theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",business-to-business marketing; decision-making uncertainty; organizational buyers; outsourcing; perceived value; relationship governance; supplier selection,Routledge,scopus-prediction
Robust dynamic estimation,Rubel O.; Naik P.A.,2017,10.1287/mksc.2016.1010,"Managing marketing resources over time requires dynamic model estimation, which necessitates specifying some parametric or nonparametric probability distribution. When the data generating process differs from the assumed distribution, the resulting model is misspecified. To hedge against such a misspecification risk, the extant theory recommends using the sandwich estimator. This approach, however, only corrects the variance of estimated parameters, but not their values. Consequently, the sandwich estimator does not affect any managerial outcomes such as marketing budgeting and allocation decisions. To overcome this drawback, we present the minimax framework that does not necessitate distributional assumptions to estimate dynamic models. Applying minimax control theory, we derive an optimal robust filter, illustrate its application to a unique advertising data set from the Canadian Blood Services, and contribute several novel findings. We discover the compensatory effect: Advertising effectiveness increases and the carryover effect decreases as robustness increases. We also find that the robust filter uniformly outperforms the Kalman filter on the out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we uncover the existence of a profit-volatility trade-off, similar to the returns-risk trade-off in finance, whereby the volatility of profit stream decreases at the expense of reduced total profit as robustness increases. Finally, we prove that, unlike for-profit companies, managers of nonprofit organizations should optimally allocate budgets opposite the advertising-to-sales ratio heuristic; that is, advertise more (less) when sales are low (high). © 2017 INFORMS.",Dynamic games; Kalman filter; Nonprofit marketing; Optimal control; Robust estimation; Sandwich estimator,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Use of weather information for agricultural decision making,Frisvold G.B.; Murugesan A.,2013,10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00022.1,"This study uses data from a special subsample of the National Agricultural, Food, and Public Policy Preference Survey to assess use of weather data for agricultural decision making. Responses from 284 Arizona farmers and ranchers were used to examine (i) the importance producers placed on different types of weather data for production and marketing decisions; (ii) which producer characteristics accounted for differences in the importance they placed on weather data; (iii) producer use of weather data for specific production and marketing decisions; and (iv) which factors distinguish weather data users from nonusers.Amodel of demand for weather information was developed and used to specify count data and discrete choice multivariate regression models. The intensity of weather data use was greater among producers with diversified agricultural production. Diversified producers were more likely to use data for timing of planting, cultivation, and harvest. Weather data use was lower among producers with greater reliance on off-farm income. Producers who rated government risk-management programs as important also found more weather data types important and used weather data for more decisions.

Travellers' behavioral intentions depending on their beliefs: an empirical study,Pantouvakis A.,2013,10.1108/17566691311316211,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is threefold: first is to study and analyse the personal beliefs of the customers regarding their generic assessments for the main issues of today: environment, culture or equal opportunities for everyone. Second, it will attempt to compare the differing opinions different customers from several countries possess. Finally, it is to relate, link and model the influence these opinions may have on the country selection made by the tourist. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is drawn from a sample of approximately 1,600 customers/tourists who visited Crete island. Those in the sample were from ten different countries of origin. The research attempts to shed some light on the importance of travellers' beliefs by using the multinomial logistic model that tested whether it can produce results for prediction and comparisons. Findings – Results suggest that tourist beliefs can be categorized in three factors, namely country's characteristics, tradition and hygiene that are differentiated among nationality groups. No robust support is provided for any relationship between travellers' values and country selection and thus arguing for further research in tourism marketing and policy. Practical implications – By using the findings of this work, hotel managers and tour operators can identify the multicultural diversity of international tourists. Originality/value – This work addresses the ways with which customers by using their personal beliefs select destinations (countries). It diverts from the mainstream relevant literature that focuses almost solely on the level of satisfaction or the level of service the customer enjoys. One of the issues that remains rather neglected is the importance that personal characteristics and attributes of the tourist/customer influence the final decision on where to spend his/her holidays. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Greece; Personal beliefs; Tourism marketing; Values,,scopus-prediction

The general theory of behavioral pricing: Applying complexity theory to explicate heterogeneity and achieve high-predictive validity,Woodside A.G.,2015,10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.02.004,"Building behavioral-pricing models-in-contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. The general theory of behavioral strategy includes a set of tenets that describes alternative configurations of decision processes and objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments associating with different outcomes involving specific price-points. This article explicates these tenets and discusses empirical studies which support the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytical tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, ethnographic decision-tree-modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis). The general theory of behavioral pricing involves the blending of cognitive science, complexity theory, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices. Consequently, behavioral pricing theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only price-setting. Capturing and reporting contextually-driven alternative routines to price setting by a compelling set of tenets represent what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory.

However, in the current paper, we do not address these two components, but rather we focus on the third component. To this end, data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique and particularly cross-efficiency formulation of the best practice frontier Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) (Charnes et al., 1978) (BPF-CCR) is used to determine those customers who should be put on the first priorities of marketing mailing list.

An integrated model for predicting consumer's intention to write online reviews,Dixit S.; Jyoti Badgaiyan A.; Khare A.,2019,10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.10.001,"For marketers, consumers’ increasing use of online reviews in arriving at purchase decisions is a double edged sword. On one hand, it presents opportunity for manufacturers and sellers to be highlighted for their good work, but at the same time, there remains a possibility of negative review impacting goodwill and reputation. Hence, it is important for managers to identify factors that impact consumers’ intentions to write online reviews. This research delves into this aspect by trying to identify the factors that impact reviews writing intentions of consumers for restaurants. The study extends the theory of planned behaviour with additions of variables such as ego involvement, taking vengeance and helping a restaurant. For this, 252 valid responses were obtained, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. Results indicate that perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, ego involvement and taking vengeance are significant predictors of intention to write online reviews for the restaurants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Consumer behaviour; E-WOM; Intentions to write online reviews; Theory of planned behaviour,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-prediction

Performance-measurement system design and functional strategic decision influence: The role of performance-measure properties,Artz M.; Homburg C.; Rajab T.,2012,10.1016/j.aos.2012.07.001,"Although conceptual research in the accounting literature suggests that the use of performance-measurement systems affects the influence of organizational actors, empirical evidence for this suggestion is largely limited to anecdotal evidence and a few qualitative case studies. Drawing on institutional theory, we develop predictions that link the use of performance measures to the influence of functional subunits in strategic decision making. Our research model tests the effects of two types of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence: (1) decision-facilitating use and (2) use for accountability. Moreover, we propose that the effects of using performance measures for these two purposes depend on the reliability and functional specificity of the measures the functional subunits use. We empirically test our hypotheses and a research question with survey data from 192 marketing directors of German firms. We find that the effect of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence depends on the two properties of the performance measures. We find no significant effects when these properties are not considered. However, decision-facilitating use of performance measures has a positive effect on functional strategic decision influence when the measures are specific to the functional subunit. With respect to the use of performance measures for accountability we find countervailing effects, as the effect on functional strategic decision influence is positive when the measures are more reliable but negative when they are more specific to the functional subunit. We discuss these findings in light of existing evidence and theory. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,,scopus-prediction
What factors explain the price of top quality wines?,Ferro G.; Benito Amaro I.,2018,10.1108/IJWBR-05-2017-0036,"Purpose: Given the growing supply of wines and the large number of new consumers with purchasing power but lacking knowledge of the subtleties of high-quality wines, expert opinions are used for consumers as proxies for quality. This study aims to determine the determinants of prices in top-quality wine market. The authors also seek to estimate the role for country of origin, grape, producing region and winery in prices. And, finally, the authors try to show how countries, regions and wineries can help increase their position in international rankings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors try to answer: What factors explain the price of top-quality wines (defined as best rated in a standardized ranking)? To some extent, in the hands of producers influence prices, which imply long-term decisions or large investments in land and marketing. Other variables that consumer value does affect prices. The authors try also to detect undervalued or overvalued wines, grapes, regions, wineries or producer countries. The authors estimate an econometric model of hedonic prices using a 14-year sample of the Wine Spectator’s 100 top-rated wines for the American market between 2003 and 2016, totaling 1,400 observations. The sample is a great cross-section because each wine is unique. Findings: The authors’ contribution is twofold: the determination of the price explanatory values and the identification and attribution of price differences by country, grape, region and winery. Also, the authors detected grapes, countries, regions and wineries which are overvalued or undervalued with respect to the average prediction of the model. Research limitations/implications: The findings are useful to understand the role of price explanatory variables, as well as for making policy and managerial decisions.

The scientific forecasting on the total value of imports and exports of top traded commodities in Taiwan are needed as the essential inputs to determine whether new top traded commodities should be imported or exported, and to make right decision toward activities in various functional areas such as building new container terminals, operation plans, marketing strategies, as well as finance and accounting [1]. Taking the original data of the amount of import and export commodity during the years from 2007 to 2013, the author tries to establish a mathematical model of Grey forecasting to make a prediction of the total value of imports and exports of top commodities in Taiwan for the next 05 coming years from 2014 to 2018. The analysis results show that the usage of Grey forecasting models resulted in a very low mean absolute percentage error, which demonstrate its applicability in practice to provide accurate forecasts. This research also indicates that for the future period of time (2014-2017), there will be a steady increase in both exports and imports value of all top commodities.

A fuzzy-oriented sentic analysis to capture the human emotion in Web-based content,Loia V.; Senatore S.,2014,10.1016/j.knosys.2013.09.024,"Capturing the sentiments and the emotional states enclosed in textual information is a critical task which embraces a wide range of web-oriented activities such as detecting the sentiments associated to the product reviews, developing marketing programs that would be attractive for users, enhancing customer service with respect to its expectation until to identifying new opportunities and financial market prediction, besides managing reputations. Opinions and the emotions that are embedded in them, play a key role in decision-making processes, with different effects depending on the negative or positive valence of the mood. When the choice depends on some important features (i.e., time, money, reliability/efficacy, etc.) and on other opinions (which come from previous experience), could be crucial to make the best decision. Inferring opinions and emotions enclosed in the written language is a complex task which cannot rely on body languages (posture, gestures, vocal inflections), rather than discovering concepts with an affective valence. The role of opinions extracted by the social content is crucial to support consumers' decision process; in addition, thanks opinions and emotions, it is possible to evidence improvements on existing decision supports and show how the opinion-mining techniques can be incorporated into these systems. This paper presents a tentative contribution that addresses this issue: it introduces a framework for extracting the emotions and the sentiments expressed in the textual data. The sentiments are expressed by a positive or negative polarity, the emotions are based on the Minsky's conception of emotions, that consists of four affective dimensions, each one with six levels of activations [1]. Sentiments and emotions are modeled as fuzzy sets; particularly, the intensity of the emotions has been tuned by fuzzy modifiers, which act on the linguistic patterns recognized in the sentences.

"Group marketing: Theory, mechanisms, and dynamics",Harmeling C.M.; Palmatier R.W.; Fang E.; Wang D.,2017,10.1509/jm.15.0495,"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Conforming purchase behavior; Dynamic group influence; Group dynamics; Group marketing; Group norms,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
Giving the Expectancy-Value Model a Heart,Henning V.; Hennig-Thurau T.; Feiereisen S.,2012,10.1002/mar.20562,"Over the past decade, research in consumer behavior has debated the role of emotion in consumer decision making intensively but has offered few attempts to integrate emotion-related findings with established theoretical frameworks. This manuscript augments the classical expectancy-value model of attitude with a dimensional model of emotion. An experiment involving 308 college students who face actual purchase decisions shows that predictions of attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual behavior can be improved through the use of the augmented model for both hedonic and utilitarian products.

Obviating some of the theoretical barriers of data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis: An application in predicting cluster membership of customers,Toloo M.; Farzipoor Saen R.; Azadi M.,2015,10.1057/jors.2014.43,"Data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA) has been used for predicting cluster membership of decision-making units (DMUs). One of the possible applications of DEA-DA is in the marketing research area. This paper uses cluster analysis to cluster customers into two clusters: Gold and Lead. Then, to predict cluster membership of new customers, DEA-DA is applied. In DEA-DA, an arbitrary parameter imposing a small gap between two clusters (η) is incorporated. It is shown that different η leads to different prediction accuracy levels since an unsuitable value for η leads to an incorrect classification of DMUs. We show that even the data set with no overlap between two clusters can be misclassified. This paper proposes a new DEA-DA model to tackle this issue. The aim of this paper is to illustrate some computational difficulties in previous DEA-DA approaches and then to propose a new DEA-DA model to overcome the difficulties. A case study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.",cluster analysis; data envelopment analysis; data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA); discriminant analysis,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,scopus-prediction
The influence of the quality in the price of the olive oils in the origin market; [La influencia de la calidad en el precio de los aceites de oliva en origen],Gutiérrez-Salcedo M.; Murgado-Armenteros E.M.; Ruiz F.J.T.,2016,,"Olive oil is a strategic sector in Spanish agriculture, as a main producer country in the world and as a symbolic product for Spanish society (in terms of economy and culture). However, in the last decade olive oil sector is supporting very low commercial margins and it has important problems of profitability. In a context where retail distribution plays an essential role in final price fixing and, therefore, in the total shared amount by all sector agents, the effectiveness of buy-and-sale strategies along the chain influences the commercial results of the different agents. In particular, the main income of olive oil producers comes from oil marketing in the market of origin, which integrates the maximum percentage of dealings (80%). The commercial operations in this market are the references for price negotiations in other levels of the agri-food chain, for example, with distributors. In this scene, Andalusia has a predominant role because it concentrates the Spanish production of olive oils (72,40%). So, the trading operations in this area determine, in part, the national price level and they have a high influence in worldwide prices. Due to its position as a supplier row material, the market of origin is playing a key role in the incomes of all the agents in the chain. For this reason, the study of price formation, its dynamic and the variables that can influence in this process, is needed in order to know the price evolution and therefore, to decide the best moment to buy and sell. In this sense, from our point of view, in the literature is possible to underline two main characteristics that could influence in price's evolution. (1) The prices of different quality levels are very similar Price's differences are small and this fact contrasts with the public strategy to improve the quality of Spanish olive oil production (quality programmes from national and regional government and the European Union). And (2), in the last decade, these differences between qualities are constant and with a similar evolution. So, it could be possible to predict price's evolution only with the price of a quality and adding some cents in order to know the price of the rest. Based on the social context and the development of databases in the market of origin in Andalusia, the objective of this paper is to analyse the casual relationship between the prices of three qualities that are sold in origin: extra virgin, virgin and lampante. The methodology used to study the price evolution and its relationships is based on the cointegration theory, the Error Correction Model and it is completed with the study of short-run relationships through Granger's causality, variance decomposition of forecast errors and impulse response functions. Analysis includes 106 monthly data of each price series for the most instability period in the market of origin (since January'01 to October'09). This information was provided by the Foundation for the Promotion and Development of the Olive Grove and Oil, based on the POOLred System of origin prices. This system collects the features of bulk olive oil transactions of a sample of Andalusian olive oil mills that represents 55.30% of Spanish olive oil production. It is currently the main price reference in this sector. Results show that, in long term, origin is a strong integrated market and it is in equilibrium because the prices of three qualities move together during all the period. However, in short term it is possible to highlight the virgin olive oil as a leader in the market. It is the quality more independent and with more influence over the rest. So, price movements of virgin quality could predict the evolution of the other price's qualities. These outcomes are coherent with the role of virgin quality in the market of origin. Virgin olive oil is the quality with more number of commercial operations in the market. This volume is a consequence of its versatility, because can be used as direct consumption product, to mix with other olive oils or to refine. On the one hand, the direct consumption of virgin quality, similar to the virgin extra olive oil could be an influence in the price of the last one, adopting a role of direct competitor. In this sense, the use of extra virgin as a bait product for distributors reduces the differences between both prices and increase the competency. Furthermore, the consumer's confusion between different qualities of olive oils favours this situation. On the other hand, because a part of virgin's production is used to refne in order to produce olive oil, its prices could be a reference for the price of lampante. At the same time, the strategy of quality implemented by public administration is increasing the volume of virgin and extra virgin olive oils produced in Andalusia and, therefore, the numbers of commercial operations with these qualities in the market of origin. So, when quality production exceeds consumption, a part of these olive oils is destined to elaborate low quality olive oil and it increases price competition. In sum, the large number of operations and its versatility transform the virgin olive oil into the quality more important in the market of origin, from the point of view of price influences. This conclusion is useful to develop managerial strategies, specifically in the forecasting of price behaviour in the market. Because the prediction of price evolution in origin market is affected by several subjective aspects (crop level or weather prevision, for example), the use of an objective predict variable, as a virgin olive oil price, could improve the results of the models. Particularly, these results affect to the study of prices in order to request to government the intervention of the market through private storage system (Spanish Ministry of Agricultural and European Union). Furthermore, in general these results are useful for the development of agri-food policies by sector institutions, which analyse the prices in the market of origin in order to make decision about funding and grant. Finally, this paper could be a starting point to analyse causal relationship between different olive oils in the two main market of the agri-food chain (origin and final market), with the objective to know what variables have to be included in price's forecast models.",Causality; ECM; Olive oils; Price; Quality,Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia,scopus-prediction
"Trade credit: the interaction of financing, marketing, operations, and risk behavior",Shi X.; Zhang S.,2014,10.1007/s11846-013-0103-7,"This paper builds an inter-organizational Stackelberg game model of trade credit. The incentive-compatible decision on credit term is made endogenously and in coordination to ensure Pareto optimality for both the supplier and the retailer. Our model factors in financing, marketing, operations, default risk, and risk attitude coherently, treating trade credit as their intersectional nexus. We introduce the uncertainty due to the possible default of the retailer on the accounts payable into our model. The in-kind nature of trade credit is in line with the two-stage lottery method employed in this paper to capture the consequences of default on trade credit effectively. We find that financing capacity encourages the supplier to extend the credit term: a larger market demand rate prompts the supplier to extend a longer credit term, but a higher holding cost for the retailer shortens the length of the credit term received. More risk-averse suppliers tend to grant shorter term, but the impact of risk attitude is insignificant. Empirically, we find evidence supporting our main theoretical predictions by employing a panel sample of manufacturing companies covering 1998–2007 from the COMPUSTAT database. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bilevel programming; Default risk; Economic ordering quantity (EOQ); Trade credit; Two-stage lottery,Springer Verlag,scopus-prediction
Networked individuals predict a community wide outcome from their local information,Chesney T.,2014,10.1016/j.dss.2013.07.006,"The term 'viral' is used to describe a phenomenon that tends to be shared by those who encounter it. This paper considers the act of responding positively to a phenomenon by sharing it with others, something exemplified by the online social media acts of choosing to 'like' on Facebook, 'retweet' on Twitter, or by a similar mechanism on websites such as LinkedIn, Flickr or Pinterest. Using a threshold model of influence, simulations are run on four network structures where a critical mass chooses to share a phenomenon that eventually either goes viral or does not. The data collected are examined to determine whether an individual node can make an accurate prediction about the state of the entire network just from information on the behavior of their neighbors. The intention is to study what it is in terms of network structure that makes an individual good at sensing the zeitgeist, or 'spirit of the age'. Findings show that those best placed to predict are 'important' as measured by network centrality, and members of numerous communities. The characteristics of the critical mass are important in determining the spread of a phenomenon and it is possible for an individual node to predict an outcome as well as an observer who has access to the state of every node in the network. Potential applications might be found in monitoring the success of marketing campaigns, or in organizations wishing to keep abreast of current trends in a situation where data on network structure is available but data on the activity of network members is limited. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Consensus decision; Simulation; Social network; Viral marketing,,scopus-prediction
A nonparametric approach to modeling choice with limited data,Farias V.F.; Jagabathula S.; Shah D.,2013,10.1287/mnsc.1120.1610,"Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the ""right"" model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a ""generic"" model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward ""automating"" the crucial task of choice model selection. © 2013 INFORMS.",Choice models; Marketing mix; Nonparametric choice; Preference list; Revenue prediction; Utility preference,,scopus-prediction
The pragmatic importance of theory for marketing practice,Rotfeld H.J.,2014,10.1108/JCM-02-2014-0854,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explain that theories provide an important tool for practitioners in guiding decisions by explaining and predicting consumer decision making when new specific research data might be unavailable. This is true despite the problems caused by some academic journal articles’ use and abuse of theory development. The argument for this crucial role of theory in marketing practice explains reasons why many practitioners dislike academic research and related theory development, as well as points out where practitioners’ criticisms are valid. Design/methodology/approach – Delineation of problems in journal articles and some research notes the overall value of work for marketing practice and (indirectly) points out the important value of practitioner-focused research publications. Findings – While marketing practitioners are wrong to condemn all theory development as useless, too often in too many ways, researchers and journals deserve it. Yet, despite the problems, marketing practice needs marketing theory. Originality/value – This paper points out an ongoing common myopia of marketing practice, whereby practitioners miss out on the value of theory development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Marketing education; Practitioner decision making; Pragmatic prediction; Theory,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction
Brain Whisperers: Cutting through the Clutter with Neuromarketing,Andrejevic M.,2012,10.3366/soma.2012.0057,"The development of the field of neuromarketing piggybacks on growing interest in the neurosciences associated with the development of new brain imaging technology and recent theorizations of the role played by emotion in consumer decision making. Neuromarketers assert that people's bodies are, for marketing purposes, more truthful than the words they utter, promising direct access to formerly concealed aspects of consumer desire. This article situates the promise to bypass the vagaries of discourse with techniques for reading the body within the broader context of a changing information environment and the forms of reflexive awareness of the partial and constructed character of narrative forms of representation. It explores the uptake by neuromarketers of recent theories that posit emotional responses as integral to the process of rational decision making. This uptake repositions marketers as adjuncts to rational deliberation rather than threats to it and the forms of autonomy and citizenship with which it is associated. However, the article argues that neuromarketers’ claims to bypass mediation and the impasses of representation break down upon further examination. In the end, an examination of the recent literature on the topic indicates that neuromarketers – like data miners – are more interested in potentially useful correlations than in underlying explanations. Their portrayal of neuromarketing as a technique for accessing what consumers’ ‘really’ feel amounts to a misreading of their own project, which might be more properly understood as the development of techniques for making probabilistic predictions about the behaviour of populations. © 2012, Edinburgh University Press.

UAV-multispectral and vegetation indices in soybean grain yield prediction based on in situ observation,da Silva E.E.; Rojo Baio F.H.; Ribeiro Teodoro L.P.; da Silva Junior C.A.; Borges R.S.; Teodoro P.E.,2020,10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100318,"Remote sensing techniques using vegetation indices (VI's) have successfully enabled the accurate and timely monitoring of several crops. The purpose of this monitoring is to provide an advantage in terms of on-farm management decision making, crop marketing planning, and support for policy decision-making. We identified here which VI's can be used to predict soybean grain yield (GY) by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and remote multispectral sensor. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in three sites during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons in Brazil. The VI's were measured together with the plant stand assessment at 25 days after emergency (DAE) when the plants were at V4 phenological stage. The processing of the VI models was performed based on the imaging reflectance factor data performed in the field. For statistical data analyses, a correlation network was used to express the relationship between GY and VI's graphically. Path analysis was performed for identifying the cause-and-effect relationship between VI's and GY. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm was generated considering GY as a dependent variable. At last, the relative deviation coefficient was used to illustrate the differences between the VI's in the construction of the decision tree and GY. Our results showed potential for predicting soybean yield based on UAV and the multispectral sensor coupled. SAVI and NDVI indices stood out for predicting yield, where the regions with the highest values of these indices can obtain the highest yield observed in the field, providing an advantage in management at the property level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Decision tree; Glycine max; Path analysis; Precision agriculture; Spatial variability,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction

Estimating the importance of consumer purchasing criteria in digital ecosystems,Peláez J.I.; Cabrera F.E.; Vargas L.G.,2018,10.1016/j.knosys.2018.07.023,"The purchasing process consists of multiple, non-isolated phases that describe the interactions between consumers and products. One of these phases is the evaluation of alternatives, in which the consumer compares the benefits that will be obtained from each product or service depending on a set of criteria. Recently, the rise of online ecosystems has fueled the development of new purchasing-decision prediction models (PDPM) based on the shared opinions, concerns, and expectations of customers. Commonly, these PDPMs are constructed as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, where experts ascertain the consumer's purchasing criteria, as well as the importance of them, by means of surveys and their own experience. Although relying on experts may be appropriate for identifying criteria, this approach is not suitable for assessing the importance of said criteria due to the large volume of information available on the Web. Furthermore, the preferences of consumers in online ecosystems evolve constantly. In this regard, we consider that the information about purchase-criteria importance should be derived exclusively from the opinions of consumers. However, the attitude and thought-process leading to purchases contain inherent relationships that consumers are not able to express explicitly; consequently, we explore the possibility to make use of the synergies between criteria along user preferences. This paper proposes a new PDPM that estimates the importance of the criteria and values the alternatives by only considering the opinions expressed by consumers in digital ecosystems, while using an expert-defined set of criteria. The proposed approach extracts the weights of both criteria and alternatives and determines the implicit synergies within them without the need of additional input. Lastly, it uses the Choquet integral for weight and valuation aggregation and determines a purchase ranking. This model has been tested in real examples, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2018",Aggregation operators; Choquet integral; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Synergy criteria,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction

The present study examines how ethics influences a person's decision to adopt cloud computing, and how in turn ethical behaviours affect technology innovations. Based on social cognitive theory, this paper proposes that a higher ethical and entrepreneurial orientation will lead to a person adopting cloud computing. Moreover, the marketing, learning and outcome expectancy a person has about cloud computing will positively affect their intention to adopt this technology. The predictions are tested through a survey, which indicates that ethics and marketing are important determinants of a person's behavioural intention towards technology innovations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of online product reviews on product returns,Sahoo N.; Dellarocas C.; Srinivasan S.,2018,10.1287/isre.2017.0736,"Although many researchers in information systems and marketing have studied the effect of product reviews on sales, few have looked at their effect on product returns. We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.",Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction

Fare prediction websites and transaction prices: Empirical evidence from the airline industry,Mantin B.; Rubin E.,2016,10.1287/mksc.2015.0965,"The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%–6% in transactions’ prices. Our results lend ample support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic behavior. © 2016 INFORMS.",Airline industry; Decision support; Information availability; Revenue management; Strategic consumers,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Semiautomated identification and classification of customer complaints,Choe P.; Lehto M.R.; Shin G.-C.; Choi K.-Y.,2013,10.1002/hfm.20325,"This paper examines the feasibility of extracting useful information from customer comments using a Naïve Bayes classifier. This was done for a database, obtained from a large Korean mobile telephone service provider, of 533 customer calls to call centers in 2009. After eliminating calls not containing customer complaints or comments, the remaining 383 comments were classified by an expert panel into four domains and 27 complaint categories. The four domains were Transaction-related (189 comments, 49%), Product-related (120 comments, 31%), Customer Service or Support-related (38 comments, 10%) and Customer Outreach and Marketing-related (36 comments, 9%). The comments were then randomly assigned to either a training set (257 cases, 67%) or test set (126 cases, 33%). The training set was used to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier that correctly predicted the domain 75% of the time and the specific subcategory 51% of the time for the test set. Prediction accuracy was strongly related to prediction strength for both sets of predictions, suggesting that simple filtering strategies where difficult to understand comments are flagged for expert review and easy comments are automatically classified are both technically feasible and likely to be practically valuable. Several strong predictors were also identified that corresponded to categories more detailed than those originally assigned. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.",Bayesian inference; Call center agent; Customer complaints; Decision support; TextMiner,,scopus-prediction

Exploiting cross-city variation, we find that air pollution levels negatively affect the sales of fuel-inefficient cars on average. This relationship, though, is U-shaped over the observed air pollution levels, in that fuel-inefficient car purchases rise with air pollution beyond some threshold. Furthermore, a city’s income level is a significant factor in this non-monotonic relationship, in the sense that consumers of higher-income cities are less likely to suffer this reversal.

Not Merely a Matter of Drawing Arrows: The Empirical Consequences of Measurement Model Specification and Recommendations for Practice,Chan E.K.; Sturman M.; Park S.; Vanderpool C.,2017,10.1177/1938965516686115,"Understanding measurement model specification is especially important for hospitality research due to its cross-disciplinary nature and the prevalence of measures used in the field which are often central to the formative versus reflective debate (e.g., SERVQUAL, socioeconomic status). The current study contributes to this topic by providing empirically based prescriptive advice to drive better measurement model specification. Specifically, the decision-making procedures developed by this study can complement theoretical reasons for a model choice as well as help determine a correct model choice when theories are equivocal or non-existent. This study combines actual and simulated data to show that model fit statistics alone cannot determine which model specification is correct, but also that a correct measurement model will generate more accurate predictions within a model which in turn will offer more accurate managerial recommendations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",formative measures; marketing constructs; reflective measures; simulations; structural equation modeling,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-prediction
Predictive analytics - The future of data-driven social marketing,Niţu C.V.,2016,,"Given the dynamic business environment of today, companies need accurate and timely information in order to make the best decisions for the company and to respond promptly to any market changes, competitors and customers needs. The emergence and development of the Internet has changed the business model. Now, the notion of quantity and quality as the only references for the growth and development of a business, have been replaced with the visibility of the company and its products on the market. Internet will help any company to successfully promote their products and services and predict how consumers will respond in the future through predictive analytics tools. If we intend to predict how consumers will respond in the future we need to know how to use forward looking analytical. Predictive analytics provide the marketer something more than standard business reports and sales forecasts, these tools provide specific forecasts for each consumer. The forecasts include all channels, both online and offline, and predict what they intend to buy or to watch, how they will respond or what consumers will refuse. If we can provide these issues, we have control of the situation. © 2016, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

The Influence of B to B Social Media Message Features on Brand Engagement: A Fluency Perspective,McShane L.; Pancer E.; Poole M.,2019,10.1080/1051712X.2019.1565132,"Purpose: Social media is increasingly drawing the attention and interest of business-to-business (B to B) organizations. Yet, B to B organizations remain cautious in their social media pursuits, in part based on a stated lack of understanding for best practices. The purpose of the current work is to take initial steps to address this challenge by identifying specific social media message features that influence online users’ engagement with B to B organizations. Methodology/Approach: This work examines the Twitter feeds of the top 50 social B to B brands (as reported by Brandwatch in 2015) to examine the effects of message features (hashtags, text difficulty, embedded media, and message timing) on user engagement, captured in terms of Twitter likes and retweets. Findings: We argue that message features that enhance fluency (e.g., images) should enhance engagement. In contrast, those that disrupt fluency (e.g., hasthags) should result in lower levels of engagement. Consistent with these predictions, we find that hashtags and text difficulty correlate to lower levels of engagement whereas embedded media in the form of images and video correlate to higher levels of engagement. Also consistent with the proposed fluency framework, we find that tweets from B to B organizations generate greater engagement on evenings and weekends. Research Implications: This research applies a fluency lens to identify specific message features that influence online engagement. In doing so, it highlights fluency as a powerful construct for understanding the drivers of B to B social media brand engagement. More generally, this work suggests fluency as a valuable conceptual lens for developing effective B to B social media strategies. This research also speaks to the complexity of B to B social media strategies–organizations must go beyond content and platform decisions, to also consider the specific features of the message. Practical Implications: Social media is becoming more and more important to B to B organizations and is as yet an underutilized engagement tool. The current work offers initial strategies regarding message features that business practitioners can incorporate into their content development strategies to strengthen engagement. Specifically, efforts should be made to attain high levels of fluency in B to B social media content development. Originality/Value/Contribution of the Paper: The current work offers initial insights as to the importance of understanding not only how social media topics/content influence engagement, but also the influence of message features (e.g., hashtags, embedded media). In doing so, it highlights fluency as a novel conceptual lens for developing more effective B to B social media strategies. Finally, it draws on actual tweets from leading B to B brands to examine the proposed influence of message features on engagement. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",B to B; business marketing; engagement; Fluency; industrial marketing; social media; Twitter,Routledge,scopus-prediction

Managerial empathy facilitates egocentric predictions of consumer preferences,Hattula J.D.; Herzog W.; Dahl D.W.; Reinecke S.,2015,10.1509/jmr.13.0296,"Common wisdom suggests that managerial empathy (i.e., the mental process of taking a consumer perspective) helps executives separate their personal consumption preferences from those of consumers, thereby preventing egocentric preference predictions. The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers' self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers' private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathie managers' self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions, the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity endorsement. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",Consumer preference predictions; Managerial decision making; Managerial empathy; Managers' consumer identity; Responsiveness to market research,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
Allocation with traffic spikes: Mixing adversarial and stochastic models,Esfandiari H.; Korula N.; Mirrokni V.,2018,10.1145/3105446,"Motivated by Internet advertising applications, online allocation problems have been studied extensively in various adversarial and stochastic models. While the adversarial arrival models are too pessimistic, many of the stochastic (such as i.i.d. or random-order) arrival models do not realistically capture uncertainty in predictions. A significant cause for such uncertainty is the presence of unpredictable traffic spikes, often due to breaking news or similar events. To address this issue, a simultaneous approximation framework has been proposed to develop algorithms that work well both in the adversarial and stochastic models; however, this framework does not enable algorithms that make good use of partially accurate forecasts when making online decisions. In this article, we propose a robust online stochastic model that captures the nature of traffic spikes in online advertising. In our model, in addition to the stochastic input for which we have good forecasting, an unknown number of impressions arrive that are adversarially chosen. We design algorithms that combine a stochastic algorithm with an online algorithm that adaptively reacts to inaccurate predictions. We provide provable bounds for our new algorithms in this framework. We accompany our positive results with a set of hardness results showing that our algorithms are not far from optimal in this framework. As a byproduct of our results, we also present improved online algorithms for a slight variant of the simultaneous approximation framework. Copyright © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Technology-enabled community data for gaining pre-release brand insights,Ponnamma Divakaran P.K.,2018,10.1016/j.techfore.2017.09.024,"In the past, studies have investigated brand equity only in the ‘post-launch’ context, hence missing opportunities to make early corrections in cases of negative favourability. Using technology-enabled online community data, this study examines whether ‘pre-launch’ brand favourability can predict community's post-launch purchase decisions, by introducing a new construct called community-based brand equity (CoBBE). This study also investigates whether CoBBE can predict future sales of new products. Weekly data are collected for eight weeks before and after product launch from a movie-based online community for a period of 16 months. The results show that community-based variables such as pre-launch brand awareness level, brand favourability and brand strength have a significant influence on 1) community members' post-release purchase decisions both in the opening week as well as the entire lifetime of products, and 2) satisfaction level. The study also finds that CoBBE is a significant predictor of future market sales, thus showing the usefulness of CoBBE as an early warning diagnostic tool which will enable movie studios to gain early brand-related insights as well as to make early corrective actions when needed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Brand awareness; Brand equity; Brand favourability; Online community; Sales prediction,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-prediction
Good and guilt-free: The role of self-accountability in influencing preferences for products with ethical attributes,Peloza J.; White K.; Shang J.,2013,10.1509/jm.11.0454,"The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Environment; Ethical products; Green marketing; Self-accountability; Sustainability,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
"Experience, socialization and customer retention: Lessons from the dance floor",Giudicati G.; Riccaboni M.; Romiti A.,2013,10.1007/s11002-013-9233-6,"Experience and socialization are key factors in customer commitment and defection decisions. To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109-126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate. This study's results indicate that the inclusion of social effects increases the predictive power of the customer churn model (Nitzan and Libai, Journal of Marketing 75(6):24-38, 2011), thus contributing to our understanding of the role social networks play in customer decisions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Co-experience network; Co-presence data; Customer retention; Relational switching cost; Social networks,,scopus-prediction
Renew or cancel? Drivers of customer renewal decisions for IT-based service contracts,v. Wangenheim F.; Wünderlich N.V.; Schumann J.H.,2017,10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.06.008,"Manufacturers increasingly integrate information and communication technologies into their products so that they can provide IT-based services. Organizations that formerly concentrated on transactional sales thus confront a new challenge associated with managing service usage—retention and extracting value from investments in smart technology. This study combines a marketing and an information systems perspective in a field study conducted jointly with a large European car manufacturer. Understanding the renewal decision for IT-based service contracts requires knowledge from both disciplines. The paper shows that combining behavioral predictor variables stemming from marketing research and technology-related perceptual variables stemming from technology acceptance research increases the explanatory power and prediction accuracy of forecasting models for customer renewal decisions. Specifically, the authors show that perceptions of usefulness become more important the longer customers use IT-based services and the more services they use within the service contract. © 2017",Contract renewal; Customer churn; Free trial; IT-based service; Retention; Smart services,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-prediction
Comparative analysis and short term sales forecasting for an Ethiopian shoe manufacturing company,Gebre T.W.; Singh R.,2016,10.17010/ijom/2016/v46/i10/102853,"Forecasts are a basic input in the decision processes of operations management because they provide information on future demand and to increase revenue. The main purpose of this paper was to compare three different quantitative forecasting methods and develop a monthly short term sales forecasting model specifically on shoes of A-Shoe Company, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Twelve months (December 2013 - November 2014) sales data (of different types of pair of shoes) was collected from the company. From quantitative forecasting methods, a time-series model, that is, moving average, weighted moving average, and exponential smoothing were used to predict monthly sales forecast for the month of December 2014. Trend equation was formulated by using the least square regression method; analysis was done along with standard error of estimate. Prediction interval limits at 95% level of confidence were calculated. Exponential smoothing forecasting method (with alpha value 0.1) was found to be fit when comparing different mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE). The forecasted shoe sales value was found to be within the prediction interval limits. ANOVA results revealed that the calculated value of F (9.34) was less than the table value of F (10.04). Hence, the null hypothesis (b = 0) is accepted. The resulting forecasting method can be used to provide a framework to forecast sales, specifically for national and international products and can position an organization's manufacturing services by designing the manufacturing service.",ANOVA; Confidence level; Quantitative forecasting methods; Sales forecasting; Shoe demand marketing,Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Mining the dominant patterns of customer shifts between segments by using top-k and distinguishing sequential rules,Akhondzadeh-Noughabi E.; Albadvi A.,2015,10.1108/MD-09-2014-0551,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to detect different behavioral groups and the dominant patterns of customer shifts between segments of different values over time. Design/methodology/approach – A new hybrid methodology is presented based on clustering techniques and mining top-k and distinguishing sequential rules. This methodology is implemented on the data of 14,772 subscribers of a mobile phone operator in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The main data include the call detail records and event detail records data that was acquired from the IT department of this operator. Findings – Seven different behavioral groups of customer shifts were identified. These groups and the corresponding top-k rules represent the dominant patterns of customer behavior. The results also explain the relation of customer switching behavior and segment instability, which is an open problem. Practical implications – The findings can be helpful to improve marketing strategies and decision making and for prediction purposes. The obtained rules are relatively easy to interpret and use; this can strengthen the practicality of results. Originality/value – A new hybrid methodology is proposed that systematically extracts the dominant patterns of customer shifts. This paper also offers a new definition and framework for discovering distinguishing sequential rules. Comparing with Markov chain models, this study captures the customer switching behavior in different levels of value through interpretable sequential rules.

Segmenting consumers purchase intention towards Edible bird's nest products using the decision tree techniques,Shukri N.N.H.M.; Nawi N.M.; Abdullah A.M.; Man N.,2019,,"Domestic consumption of nutritional products and food supplements are on the rise. This is due to the fact that consumers have become more affluent and aware of their health. Edible bird's nest (EBN) is used as a health supplement for medicinal benefits to improve health quality. However, issues such as contamination and counterfeit EBN have caused fluctuation of the product's price over time and consumers are slowly shunning away from consuming EBN products. Marketing effort is a strategy tool often used to convince buying intention among consumers and therefore relieve the public's anxiety. Presently, the extent of marketing mix that can convince consumers' intention to purchase EBN products remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the influence of marketing mix towards consumers' intention to purchase EBN products. Principle component analysis and decision tree models were used to analyze the data. The performance of three decision tree models was compared based on accuracy and sensitivity rate. Result showed that all three models possessed similar accuracy rate (CART = 84.35%, C5.0 = 84.73%, QUEST = 83.08%), while C5.0 had the highest sensitivity (CART = 84.7%, C5.0 = 87.46%, QUEST = 85.59%). The important variables derived from C5.0 model are health conscious, gender, promotion, race, price, employment, and income.

Consumer attitude metrics for guiding marketing mix decisions,Hanssens D.M.; Pauwels K.H.; Srinivasan S.; Vanhuele M.; Yildirim G.,2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0841,"Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample. For managers and researchers alike, our criteria offer a verifiable explanation for differences in marketing elasticities and an actionable connection between marketing and financial performance metrics. © 2014 INFORMS.",Consumer attitude metrics; Cross-effects model; Dynamic programming model; Empirical generalizations; Hierarchical linear model; Optimal marketing resource allocation; Potential; Responsiveness; Sales conversion; Stickiness,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
What Happens When Manufacturers Perform The Retailing Functions?,Li J.; Chan T.Y.; Lewis M.,2016,10.1111/poms.12549,"This study examines the effects of a relatively new channel structure on prices and sales in a large department store, which in recent years has switched the management of many of its product categories from a traditional retailer-managed system to a manufacturer-managed system. We find that the change caused overall retail prices to decrease. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the response across brands. In the cell phone category, brands with high market shares and inelastic demand did not change prices. In the watch category, the retail prices of relatively low-end brands decreased while the prices of premium brands increased substantially after the switch. In addition to sales increases due to lower prices, we find that the channel structure change further caused sales to increase by 9–10% in the cell phone category and by 11–17% in the watch category. These results are consistent with previous theoretical predictions. We believe that our results provide important academic and managerial implications due to the increasing prevalence of manufacturer-managed systems in the retail industry. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society",channel management; decision delegation; empirical study; marketing; retailing,Wiley-Blackwell,scopus-prediction
Estimating Network Effects in Two-Sided Markets,Hinz O.; Otter T.; Skiera B.,2020,10.1080/07421222.2019.1705509,"The proliferation of the Internet has enabled platform intermediaries to create two-sided markets in many industries. Time-series data on the number of customers on both sides of the markets allow platform intermediaries for estimating the direction and magnitude of network effects, which can then support growth predictions and subsequent information technology (IT) or marketing investment decisions. This article investigates the conditions under which this estimation of same-side and cross-side network effects should distinguish between its impact on the number of new customers (i.e., acquisition) and existing customers (i.e., their activity). The authors propose an influx-outflow model for doing so and conduct a simulation study to benchmark the new model against the traditional model. Further they compare the models in an illustrative empirical study in which they study the growth of an Internet auction platform. The results show that this separation of effects is beneficial because the existing customers on both sides of the market can influence the acquisition and dropout of other customers asymmetrically. The paper thus makes an important contribution that should impact the way how researchers and business practitioners measure network effects in two-sided markets. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",customer acquisition; customer churn; electronic commerce; online intermediaries; platform economy; Two-sided markets,Routledge,scopus-prediction

Customer churns prediction in telecom using adaptive logitboost learning approach,Hemalatha M.; Mahalakshmi S.,2020,,"In telecom sector, huge amount of data is generated on daily routine owing to extensive client base. Business analysts and decision makers highlighted that including new customers seems to be costly than that of maintaining prevailing customers. Customer relationship management (CRM) and Business analysts have to recognize the cause of churn customers and to validate behavioural patterns from prevailing churn customer‘s data. This work anticipated a churn prediction model that utilizes clustering and classification approaches to recognize churn customers and to give factors that resides behind customer churning in telecom sectors. Feature selection is carried out with association attribute ranking model and weighted oversampling technique. The proposed approach initially classifies churn customers data with Adaptive Logitboost (ALB) classification algorithm for classifying the instance more appropriately. Generation of retention policies is a significant process of relationship management to eliminate churners. After performing classification approach, these model segments customers‘ data by categorization using requirement similarity matrix to acquire information gain. This model validates churn factors that are needed for determining primary cause of churn. By recognizing essential churn factors from customer data, CRM may enhance productivity by recommending appropriate promotions to set of customers based on association among behavioural patterns. Thereby, marketing campaigns are improved for the company. The anticipated churn prediction model is computed with metrics like precision, accuracy, F-measure, recall and receiving operating characteristics (ROC) area. Results depict that anticipated churn prediction provides better classification with ALB and customer profiling with requirement similarity matrix. Moreover, it provides cause of customer churning through generation of related pattern association. © 2020 IJSTR.",Association rule; Behavioural pattern; Churn customer; Prediction model; Similarity matrix,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,scopus-prediction

The results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a significant increase in accuracy. Hence, the existing skepticism concerning heuristics should be questioned. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.",Adaptive decision making; Customer management; Fast and frugal heuristics; Mouselab; Process-tracing,,scopus-prediction
Personal relevance and mental simulation amplify the duration framing effect,Ülkümen G.; Thomas M.,2013,10.1509/jmr.10.0172,"Different framing of the same duration (one year, 12 months, 365 days) can influence consumers' impressions of subjective duration, thereby affecting their judgments and decisions. The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Duration framing; Duration perception; Mental simulation; Personal relevance; Process simulation,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction

Detect potential relations by link prediction in multi-relational social networks,Chen L.; Gao M.; Li B.; Liu W.; Chen B.,2018,10.1016/j.dss.2018.09.006,"Potential relation detecting on social network has become more important for decision making in many business disciplines, such as marketing, business strategy, human resources development, finance planning, business transformation, insurance policy design, and tourism management. People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for “word of mouth” advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms. © 2018",Link prediction; Matrix completion; Multi-relational social networks; Potential relations; Similarity,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction

We argue that the benefits of simplicity are often overlooked because of a pervasive ""bias bias"": the importance of the bias component of prediction error is inflated, and the variance component of prediction error, which reflects an oversensitivity of a model to different samples from the same population, is neglected. Using the study of cognitive heuristics, we discuss how to reduce variance by ignoring weights, attributes, and dependencies between attributes, and thus make better decisions. Bias and variance, we argue, offer a more insightful perspective on the benefits of simplicity than Occam''s razor. © 2015 .",Bias bias; Bias-variance dilemma; Occam's razor; Out-of-sample prediction; Simple heuristics; Uncertainty,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-prediction
Environmental considerations in the purchase decisions of Ghanaian consumers,Opoku R.; Famiyeh S.; Kwarteng A.,2020,10.1108/SRJ-11-2016-0206,"Purpose: By relying on the Theory of Planned Behavior, this paper aims to understand the relative importance of attitude, subjective norm (SN), behavioral control, self-identity (SI) and past behavior in the prediction of green purchase behavior among Ghanaian consumers. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 306 graduate students were surveyed on the environmental considerations in their purchase behavior using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Findings: The results of the study indicate that, in general, attitude and SI are more important than SN in influencing green purchase intention in a collectivistic country, such as Ghana. Yet, most respondents were neutral in their responses to questions as to whether they are green consumers and/or if they consider themselves to be concerned about environmental issues. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to study environmental consideration in purchase decisions in Ghana, a resource-rich, emerging and one of the strongest economies in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Environment; Ghana; Green consumer; Green marketing; Sub-Saharan Africa; Theory of planned behaviour,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction
(De)marketing to manage consumer quality inferences,Miklós-Thal J.; Zhang J.,2013,10.1509/jmr.11.0432,"Savvy consumers attribute a product's market performance to its intrinsic quality as well as the seller's marketing push. The authors study how sellers should optimize their marketing decisions in response. They find that a seller can benefit from ""demarketing"" its product, meaning visibly toning down its marketing efforts. Demarketing lowers expected sales ex ante but improves product quality image ex post, as consumers attribute good sales to superior quality and lackluster sales to insufficient marketing. The authors derive conditions under which demarketing can be a recommendable business strategy. A series of experiments confirm these predictions. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Analytical modeling; Demarketing, observational learning; New product adoption; Quality inference",American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
Revisiting optimal cutoff score determination in direct marketing using BLINEX loss: Bayesian decisive prediction approach,Levy M.S.; Wen D.; Chakilam V.; Wang H.-Y.,2016,10.1080/01966324.2016.1173607,"We develop a method to predict an optimal cutoff point from an ascending list of potential customer activation scores tomaximize profit in a future direct marketing campaign. The scoring model is based upon attributes available froma database. Our Bayesian predictive decision theoretic solution is based on two features: (1) a three-parameter bounded, asymmetric loss function BLINEX that has a higher penalty for failure to choose good prospects rather than including too many bad prospects; and (2) a Bayesian nonstandard t-predictive distribution for a future optimal score derived from normal-gamma likelihood function with unknown mean and variance based on data consisting of past optimal activation scores together with a four-parameter conjugate prior. The parameters of the BLINEX loss are also derived from past data. A comparison of BLINEX derived profits with those fromtraditional squared error loss is made via a fractional factorial experimental design with a half-normal analysis. It shows that our method is far superior based on predicted profit and that, of all parameters, the BLINEX asymmetry and prior mean are the most influential main effects. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Bayesian decision theory; Bayesian prediction; BLINEX loss; Predictive inference; Scoring models,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-prediction
Signaling effects and the role of culture: movies in international auxiliary channels,Sinha A.; Gu H.; Kim N.; Emile R.,2019,10.1108/EJM-09-2017-0587,"Purpose: Given the high uncertainty in the quality perception of experiential products, manufacturers use signals to influence consumers’ decisions. In the movie industry, literature shows that performance of the main channel (e.g. cinema) strongly influences the performance of auxiliary channels (e.g. DVDs). The success of a movie in the home country is also to be resonated by its good performance in host countries. However, the cultural contingency of these success-breeds-success (SBS) effects has not been examined. This paper aims to test the influence of cultural values on the SBS effects across channels and countries. Design/methodology/approach: Borrowing concepts from the signaling literature and analyzing DVD sales data from six international markets using a multilevel mixed-effects model, the study finds that culture plays a significant role to influence both SBS effects. Findings: In countries with low power distance, short-term orientation and high indulgence, consumers who purchase from auxiliary channels are more likely to be influenced by the box office performance of movies. Meanwhile, cultural distance between the home and host nations significantly decreases the cross-national SBS effect. Research limitations/implications: The findings are likely to be generalized to online auxiliary channels of movies, but empirical testing is required to ensure that no major adaptation is required in the process. Future research can also extend the framework of this paper to include more countries into the analysis and investigate cultural variables beyond Hofstede’s dimensions. Practical implications: This paper suggests that the SBS effects may vary across nations. When managers plan for the sequential distributions of experiential products, the cultural values of target markets should be considered to decrease the uncertainty in sales prediction. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the international auxiliary channels of movies and incorporating cultural values into the framework of sequential distributions. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to test the links between the main and auxiliary channels from an international marketing perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Auxiliary channels; Cultural values; Hierarchical mixed-effect models; International marketing; Movies,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-prediction
Predicting adoption probabilities in social networks,Fang X.; Hu P.J.; Li Z.L.; Tsai W.,2013,10.1287/isre.1120.0461,"In a social network, adoption probability refers to the probability that a social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Naïve Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer limited predictive power and that confounding factors are critical to adoption probability predictions. © 2013 INFORMS.",Adoption probability; Bayesian learning; Confounding factor; Entity similarity; Social influence; Social network; Structural equivalence,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
EEG frontal asymmetry predicts product purchase differently for national brands and private labels.,Garczarek-Bak U.; Disterheft A.,2018,10.1037/npe0000094,"The results of the following study show that among various neurophysiological measures, only the frontal asymmetry index measured with electroencephalography was significant in predicting further purchase decisions. The decision to buy was also influenced by the brand type (national brand or private label). Data from 21 participants were recorded during exposure to 20 fast-moving consumer goods. The electroencephalographic signal from the frontal lobe (F3 and F4) served to calculate the frontal asymmetry index for alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Electromyographic electrodes were placed on the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles, whereas the galvanic skin responses were gathered from the forefinger and ring finger of the nondominant hand. Eye tracking glasses were used to control for eye movements. After product exposure, participants filled in the Purchase Intentions Scale, which then served to assess the final binary decision. A logistic regression model was applied to determine which neurophysiological factors play a crucial role in predicting a purchase decision and whether the brand type is relevant. The prediction rate of the resulting model was 65.8%.

A primer to the general theory of behavioral strategies in business-to-business marketing,Woodside A.G.,2014,10.1108/S1069-096420140000021012,"The general theory of behavioral strategies includes a set of propositions supporting alternative configurations of objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments by executives. The theory includes the outcomes of selections of specific decision alternatives. Building behavioral-strategy models in contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. This chapter is a primer to the general theory. A brief review of relevant empirical studies supports the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytically tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, statistical hypothesis testing, ethnographic decision tree modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., qualitative comparative analysis, QCA). The general theory is the blending of cognitive science, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices in explicit contexts. Consequently, behavioral-strategy theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only decision-making. Capturing and reporting contextually driven alternative routines to strategy setting by a compelling set of propositions represents what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory. The general theory serves as a useful foundation for advances theory and improving the practice of implemented strategies.

Aras Design and Multimedia Centre (ADMC): it’s pricing strategy for video internet market training,Basiruddin R.; Tobi S.U.M.; Quoquab F.,2016,10.1108/EEMCS-01-2016-0003,"Subject area: Managerial Accounting, Strategic Marketing. More specifically, cost behavior, cost estimation, cost prediction, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, contribution income statement and pricing/promotional strategy. Study level/applicability: This case is suitable to be used in advanced undergraduate level. Case overview: This case demonstrates the issues relating to pricing strategy of “Video Internet Marketing Training”. Diyana Tahir and her husband, Abdul Rahim Abdul Shukor, established Aras Design & Multimedia Centre (ADMC) on January 17, 2009. The main office was located at Kuala Lumpur. Diyana was a well-known name in the field of internet video marketing training. In its early years, ADMC’s operation was limited to providing printing and graphic design services and offering printing materials for photocopy. However, with the passage of time, the company began to expand its services and offerings. At the beginning of 2010, ADMC offered editing facilities and services for video and multimedia in addition to its core services. As a unique marketing strategy, Diyana offered RM30 as the basic training fee for each participant, which was equivalent to RM470 value offered. In this way, she attracted customers to take part in further advanced level training that was conducted by ADMC. However, she felt that the number of participant to take advanced training was not satisfactory. She thought that it happened perhaps due to the fact that the participants were not much committed to the course since it was offered at a nominal price. Furthermore, she realized that the cost of providing such training had risen in the past six months. Currently, ADMC suffered losses in three consecutive months, and they really needed enough cash to sustain. As such, Diyana was thinking to reconsider the offered course fees whether to increase it. She was in a rush to make a decision to propose the new course fee in the monthly meeting with management committee at the end of April 2013. Expected learning outcomes: Using this case, students can learn how a small-scale company can strategize its pricing strategy to survive in the highly competitive online market. The objectives of using this case are as follows: to help students in understanding the interrelationships between CVP in organization that can be used for future planning and decision-making; to be able to identify the cost structure of the basic training course (e.g. fixed and variable costs), determine the contribution margin, break-even point and prepare the contribution income statement that highlighting cost behavior; to help students to think critically while setting the price for the offered services; to develop students’ ability in analyzing the existing situation to come up with a viable and effective solution; to assist students in taking the right move in a right time; to broaden students’ views and understanding in considering the monetary aspect along with the human aspect in formulating an effective marketing strategy; to develop students’ understanding of the way to retain and attract customers through innovative pricing strategy; and to make students aware that innovation is the key to business success.

Predictive validity of evidence-based persuasion principles: An application of the index method,Armstrong J.S.; Du R.; Green K.C.; Graefe A.,2016,10.1108/EJM-10-2015-0728,"Purpose – This paper aims to test whether a structured application of persuasion principles might help improve advertising decisions. Evidence-based principles are currently used to improve decisions in other complex situations, such as those faced in engineering and medicine. Design/methodology/approach – Scores were calculated from the ratings of 17 self-trained novices who rated 96 matched pairs of print advertisements for adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles. Predictions from traditional methods – 10,809 unaided judgments from novices and 2,764 judgments from people with some expertise in advertising and 288 copy-testing predictions – provided benchmarks. Findings – A higher adherence-to-principles-score correctly predicted the more effective advertisement for 75 per cent of the pairs. Copy testing was correct for 59 per cent, and expert judgment was correct for 55 per cent. Guessing would provide 50 per cent accurate predictions. Combining judgmental predictions led to substantial improvements in accuracy. Research limitations/implications – Advertisements for high-involvement utilitarian products were tested on the assumption that persuasion principles would be more effective for such products. The measure of effectiveness that was available –day-after-recall – is a proxy for persuasion or behavioral measures. Practical/implications – Pretesting advertisements by assessing adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles in a structured way helps in deciding which advertisements would be best to run. That procedure also identifies how to make an advertisement more effective. Originality/value – This is the first study in marketing, and in advertising specifically, to test the predictive validity of evidence-based principles. In addition, the study provides the first test of the predictive validity of the index method for a marketing problem. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Advertising; Combing forecasts; Copy testing; Expertise; Intentions; Judgmental forecasting,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-prediction
Language symmetry: A force behind persuasion,Yeager J.; Sommer L.,2012,,"Language operates according to rules. Rules mean prediction. The application of these language rules to persuasive campaigns through linguistic technology can result in major gains in advertising, political and marketing outcomes. For qualitative researchers in communications, marketing and messaging, one area of persuasive language technology can be found in the linguistic feature of symmetry. Language has many forms of symmetry, and most persuaders are unaware that a great deal of persuasion depends upon symmetrical message structures. In persuasion, a mirror image or symmetrical reflection of an attitude or opinion is more persuasive than a random or non-symmetrical message or idea. Reading the subtle features of language to create symmetrical responses can create extraordinarily successful results for research and applied persuasive efforts ranging from single interviews to mass marketing campaigns. © 2012: Joseph Yeager, Linda Sommer, and Nova Southeastern University.",Decision prototyping; Linguistic research; Linguistic symmetry; Motivation and decision grammar; Persuasive communications; Predictive motivational profiling; Qualitative research,Peace and Conflict Studies,scopus-prediction

A 2020 perspective on “Online ad effectiveness evaluation with a two-stage method using a Gaussian filter and decision tree approach”,Wang H.; Hong M.,2020,10.1016/j.elerap.2020.100928,"Online ads create opportunities for advisers to discover potential customers by delivering marketing massages through the Internet. Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profitability. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The research evaluation results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible. The prediction results of M-GFDT and the method itself are useful for helping advertisers to optimize their ad strategies. © 2020",Data analytics; Decision tree; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filter; Online ad,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction
The role of situational factor on buyer characteristics and purchase decision among Malaysian low-cost airline travellers,Kalaiarasan K.; Govindan S.; Nasaratnam S.,2018,,"Buyer characteristics are a set of psychological, social, personal, and cultural factors which influence purchase decisions. Buyer characteristics lead to the purchase of a product or service, which impacts organization profit maximization and sustainability. Therefore, organizations emphasize building strong relationship with buyers. This has become a marketing priority in the current marketing environment. In airline perspective, the Malaysian low-cost airline industry is a major contributor to the national and global economy. However, the low-cost airline industry is facing purchase decision issues on domestic traveller aspect. Thus, the objective of this research is to investigate the significant relationship between buyer characteristics and purchase decision and to examine whether situational factors act to strengthen purchase decisions. As such, this research focused on how buyer characteristics impact purchase decision. In addition, situational factors as a moderation effect on purchase decision were tested using survey questionnaire. The sample for this research was 200 low-cost Malaysian travellers. The findings of this research revealed that buyer characteristic had a significant relationship with purchase decision and the situational factor moderated to strength the model with 62.5% of prediction.

David vs. Goliath: An analysis of asymmetric mixed-strategy games and experimental evidence,Amaldoss W.; Jain S.,2002,10.1287/mnsc.48.8.972.165,"Mixed strategies are widely used to model strategic situations in diverse fields such as economics, marketing, political science, and biology. However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects. We find that the EWA learning model tracks the investment decisions of our subjects well, whether we hold out trials or an entire group of subjects.",Competitive strategy; Decision analysis; Experimental economics; Learning; Marketing; R & D,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
"Consumer choice processes: Search, or automatic response?",Wasson C.R.,1979,10.1007/BF02729685,"The emphasis on consumer decision models implies that purchases largely result from a deliberate conscious search. In truth, purchases of even the new are largely unconcious automatic responses (habits, perceptions, attitudes, roles, ect.). The difficulty the customer experiences in changing such automatic response patterns is the key to understanding the widely disparate rates of adoption and diffusion of successful new products. Forecasting the timing and speed of market growth is crucial for the introducer. A mistake in either direction is serious and may be disastrous.

Understanding investors' decisions to purchase innovative products: Drivers of adoption timing and range,Hoffmann A.O.I.; Broekhuizen T.L.J.,2010,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2010.08.002,"This paper integrates findings from marketing and finance literature to increase our understanding of consumers' decisions to purchase innovative investment products. Two different surveys administered to individual investors examine the psychological and sociological drivers of dispositional innovativeness and its effects on adoption timing and range of adoption for five new investment products. Study 1 shows that consumer psychographics (e.g., market mavenism, product-category involvement, and ambiguity intolerance) rather than socio-demographics (e.g., age, education, and risk profile) explain dispositional innovativeness and that dispositional innovativeness strongly impacts time of adoption and ownership of new investment products. Study 2 cross-validates the results of Study 1 and investigates the indirect effects of dispositional innovativeness on adoption timing through consumers' perceptions of new investment products' complexity, riskiness, and visibility (exposure to and engagement in word-of-mouth). Individuals who score high on dispositional innovativeness adopt new investment products quickly because they perceive lower complexity and greater visibility, not because they perceive lower risk. The combined results of Studies 1 and 2 show that individual investors' psychological and sociological roots systematically explain their innovative adoption behavior and indicate that - counter to standard finance predictions - they incorporate more than just risk-return trade-offs in their investment choices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer financial decision-making; Dispositional innovativeness; Individual investor decision-making; Marketing-finance interface; New product adoption,,scopus-prediction
Understanding geographical markets of online firms using spatial models of customer choice,Jank W.; Kannan P.K.,2005,10.1287/mksc.1050.0145,"As the online channel matures, many firms are finding that an understanding of how their online customers' preferences and choices vary across geographical markets can be very useful. In this paper, we propose a spatial multinomial model of customer choice and illustrate how spatial modeling of choices of online customers across geographical markets provides useful insights in the context of a product mix and pricing decision of an online book publisher. The spatial multinomial model specifically accounts for the spatial correlations among customer choices among different product forms - print and PDF. The estimation results obtained using data generated from an online experiment show that the spatial model accounts for the geographical variation in many of the unobserved effects possibly due to locational differences and price sensitivities. The resultant spatial decision maps provide useful predictions as to how purchase rates vary across geographical markets as a function of the price differential between product forms, with implications for targeting customers through local market advertising, direct marketing, and cross-channel promotion. © 2005 INFORMS.",Digital products; Internet; Mixed multinomial logit; Pricing; Spatial model,,scopus-prediction
Productive play time: The effect of practice on consumer demand for hedonic experiences,Murray K.B.; Bellman S.,2011,10.1007/s11747-010-0205-6,"In this paper we explain how practice, prior knowledge and task difficulty interact to affect demand for hedonic experiences. As predicted by the human capital model, we propose that the key determinant of demand for hedonic experiences is the increase in performance efficiency that can be gained through practice. In addition, we argue that the nature of the effect of practice is distinctly different in hedonic consumption, compared to utilitarian consumption. Specifically, for hedonic experiences, practice allows consumers to extract greater value within a given period of time, rather than reduce the amount of time spent on a (utilitarian) task. Finally, we argue that if changes in performance efficiency across repeated hedonic experiences adhere to the power law of practice, then both prior knowledge and task difficulty will be important moderators of the main effect of practice on demand. These predictions are tested in two experiments that use an online panel to examine consumer demand for videogames. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.",Decision making; Experience; Hedonic products; Human capital model; Internet; Power law of practice; Prior knowledge; Utilitarian; Videogames,,scopus-prediction

Design/methodology/approachThe research adopted the method of structured content analysis and carried out the survey in Chinese home appliance industry, mainly covering the largest firms, including TCL, Hisense, Changhong, Konka, Haier, and Skyworth. The method of multiple regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. FindingsThe results show that in order to comprehensively forecast competitor's responding behaviors, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market. Additionally, in the process of dynamic interaction, the attacking or responding action is not independent and it is related significantly to another three type decisions, which are market and non-market, strategic and tactic, and collective and individual. Further, the study asserts that, in market field, tactic activity is more likely to trigger competitor's response than strategic one, while in non-market, the situation is just the opposite. Meanwhile, the study figured out that individual market attack is easier to trigger individual market and non-market response, as well as collective market response. While for non-market action, whatever it is individual or collective, both would be easy to provoke competitor's collective response. Originality/valueThe research findings extend the existing competitive interaction theory to non-market field. When forecasting competitor's choice of the competitive action, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market, attaching importance to certain situation of competitor's taking such non-market action as corporate philanthropy, etc. to launch an attack or a response for gaining competitive advantage. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",China; Competitive advantage; Marketing strategy,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-prediction

The interactive effect of relative and referent thinking on willingness to seek a bargain,Saini R.; Rao R.S.; Monga A.,2010,10.1509/jmkg.74.1.34,"Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets © 2010, American Marketing Association.",Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Sales promotions,,scopus-prediction
Incorporating context effects into a choice model,Rooderkerk R.P.; Van Heerde H.J.; Bijmolt T.H.A.,2011,10.1509/jmkr.48.4.767,"The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a contextfree partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Behavioral decision making; Choice models; Context effects; Hierarchical bayes; Product line design,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
A mathematical programming model for market share prediction,Oral M.; Kettani O.,1989,10.1016/0169-2070(89)90064-2,"The primary objective of the multiattribute models in the area of marketing is to discover the way the consumers make their choice among available alternative products. Discovering the process of choice of the customers serves as a basis for many marketing decisions such as new product planning, advertising message selection, product positioning, pricing, concept testing, sales forecasting, benefit segmentation, personal selling strategy formulation, etc. The multiattribute models proposed for this purpose can be grouped into two classes: (i) models based on mathematical programming techniques, and (ii) models based on statistical techniques. The recent literature surveys indicate that the results obtained from linear programming models show greater stability and better predictive ability. In this study therefore we will concentrate only on the mathematical programming methods of estimation in general and on a new market share prediction model in particular. The main feature of the proposed model is that it recognizes the dependence of attribute weights on attribute scores through a step function. The predictive ability of the model is discussed via a hypothetical numerical example. © 1989.",Market share; Mathematical programming; Multiattribute choice,,scopus-prediction
Asymmetric promotion effects and brand positioning,Bronnenberg B.J.; Wathieu L.,1996,10.1287/mksc.15.4.379,"Several studies have shown that promotions of national brands yield more effect than those of store brands; (e.g, Allenby and Rossi 1991, Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989). However the evolution of price-quality data available from Consumer Reports over the last 15 years seems to reveal a reduction of the quality gap between store brands and national brands, while price differences remain substantial. Simultaneously, the share of private label brands has increased (Progressive Grocer 1994). In this context, we study whether we can maintain a view of the world where national brands may easily attract consumers from store brands through promotions, whereas store brands are relatively ineffective in attracting consumers from national brands by such means. We analyze consumer reactions to price discounts in a parsimonious preference model featuring loss aversion and reference-dependence along dimensions of price and quality (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993, Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The key result of our analysis is that, given any two brands, there is an asymmetric promotion effect in favor of the higher quality /higher price brands if and only if the quality gap between the brands is sufficiently large in comparison with the price gap. Thus, the direction of promotion asymmetry is not unconditional. It depends uniquely on the value of the ratio of quality and price differences compared to a category specific criterion, which we call Φ. If the ratio of quality and price differences is larger than this criterion, the usual asymmetry prevails; if such is not the case, the lower quality/ lower price brands promote more effectively. More precisely, our model predicts that cross promotion effects depend on two components of brand positioning in the price/quality quadrant. First, we define a variable termed ""positioning advantage"" that indicates whether, relative to the standards achieved by another brand, a given brand is under-priced (positive advantage) or overpriced (negative advantage). Promotion effectiveness is increasing in this variable. Second, cross promotion effects between two brands depend on their distance in the price/quality quadrant. This variable impacts promotion effectiveness negatively and symmetrically for any pair of brands. ""Positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance"" are orthogonal components of brand positioning, irrespective of the degree of correlation between available price and quality levels in the market. Empirically, we investigate the role of brand positioning in explaining cross promotion effects using panel data from the chilled orange juice and peanut butter categories. We compute the independent positioning variables, ""positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance,"" from readily available data on price and quality positioning after obtaining our estimates of Φ. We next measure promotion effectiveness by estimating choice share changes in response to a price discount, using a choice model that does not contain any information about quality/price ratios. Finally, we test the relation between the two positioning variables and the promotion effectiveness measures. The data reveal that in the orange juice category lower quality/lower price brands generally promote more effectively than higher quality/higher price brands. In the peanut butter data the opposite asymmetry holds. In both cases, inter-brand promotion patterns are well explained by the positioning variables. An attractive feature of our model is that, in addition to the direction of promotion asymmetries, it also explains the extent of those asymmetries. A further interesting aspect of this approach is that we go beyond a categorization of brands into price tiers. For instance, lower tier brands in our data may promote more effectively than one national brand but less effectively than another. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the data presented here seem to confirm that such cases occur because the lower tier brand offers a favorable trade-off of price and quality differences compared with one national brand and a less favorable trade-off compared with the other. The content of this paper is potentially relevant for brand managers or retailers concerned with predicting the impact of their promotions. The paper is of particular interest to marketing scientists who study the performance of store brands versus national brands and may also appeal to those who wish to explore the marketing implications of behavioral decision theory. Finally, our investigation does not reject Blattberg and Wisniewski's (1989) finding, shared by Allenby and Rossi (1991) and Hardie, Johnson, and Fader (1993), that national brands have a principle advantage in promotion effectiveness. Rather, it formalizes when this principle advantage is overruled by positioning disadvantages of such brands.",Brand choice; Brand positioning; Loss aversion; Promotion; Reference-dependence,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Linking marketing and engineering product design decisions via analytical target cascading,Michalek J.J.; Feinberg F.M.; Papalambros P.Y.,2005,10.1111/j.0737-6782.2005.00102.x,"Firms design products that appeal to consumers and are feasible to produce. The resulting marketing and engineering design goals are driven by consumer preferences and engineering capabilities, two issues that conveniently are addressed in isolation from one another. This convenient isolation, however, typically will not result in optimal product decisions when the two problems are interrelated. A method new to the marketing community, analytical target cascading (ATC), is adopted here to explore such interrelationships and to formalize the process of coordinating marketing and engineering design problems in a way that is proven to yield the joint optimal solution. The ATC model is built atop well-established marketing methodologies, such as conjoint, discrete choice modeling and demand forecasting. The method is demonstrated in the design of dial-readout household scales, using real conjoint choice data and a parametric engineering product design model. Results indicate that the most profitable achievable product can fall short of predictions based on marketing alone but well ahead of what engineering may produce based on original marketing target specifications. A number of extensions can be accomplished readily using techniques from the extant marketing and design optimization literature.",,,scopus-prediction
ON THE USE OF VERBAL PROTOCOLS IN CONJOINT ANALYSIS STUDIES,Cattin P.,1981,10.1111/j.1540-5915.1981.tb00123.x,"A recent study by Olshavsky and Acito helped gain insight into (a) the decision process used by respondents when asked to do a conjoint task, (b) the predictive validity of conjoint models compared to models derived from verbal protocols, and (c) the reasons for prediction errors. In this article, the author argues that the Olshavsky and Acito results do not lead one to believe that the compensatory conjoint models can be potentially more misleading than models that try to represent more accurately the underlying evaluation process with noncompensatory and compensatory rules. Hence, it does not seem necessary to try to identify noncompensatory rules in a conjoint study. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

Anticipating a regrettable purchase: Implications of erroneous affective forecasting for marketing planning,Sevdalis N.; Kokkinaki F.; Harvey N.,2008,10.1108/02634500810879287,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of consumers' erroneous affective self-forecasts, and discuss the implications of such forecasts for consumer purchasing behaviour and marketing planning. Design/methodology/approach - First, the literature on inaction inertia - the lowering of the likelihood that a bargain will be taken once a better bargain has been missed - is reviewed. Second, the literature on affective self-forecasting is reviewed. Finally, the implications that the authors synthesis of the behavioural evidence carries for marketing are discussed. Findings - The in action inertia literature implicates the regret that consumers associate with purchasing a discounted item once they have missed a much larger discount on it as a major contributing factor to consumers' unwillingness to purchase the item on the second occasion. The literature on affective self-prediction suggests that regret (and other emotions) is systematically mispredicted. Research limitations/implications - The likely effect of erroneously anticipated regret in inaction inertia situations is depressed purchasing behaviour. The paper argues that because affective anticipations are typically erroneous, their impact on consumer decision-making processes cannot be deemed rational. It is proposed that marketing should intervene to either increase the accuracy of such anticipations, or to lead consumers to discount them. Practical implications - Price promotions can have negative side effects, such as those observed in inaction inertia circumstances. To some extent, these are driven by consumers anticipated regret (and possibly other relevant emotions). Marketing techniques can counteract the disproportionate impact of such emotions. Originality/value - The paper offers a synthesis of behavioural evidence on inaction inertia and affective self-forecasting - two quite separate literatures that have yet to be brought together in the present context. In addition, the paper outlines implications for marketing and suggests possible strategies to moderate the discussed effects.",Advertising; Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Pricing; Sales forecasting,,scopus-prediction
Procedural rationality and the need to aggregate,Myers G.M.; Papageorgiou Y.Y.,1997,10.3406/spgeo.1997.1066,"A significant part of theory in economic geography is founded on the paradigm of economic choice behaviour. Some of its predictions, therefore, must be sensitive to the strong simplifications of this paradigm. This is why it seems useful to identify, discuss and evaluate those simplifications as they exist to-day. Toward this end, we compare models of choice behaviour in economics, including the most recent ones, with a standard paradigm of consumer behaviour in psychology and marketing.

"Instant customer base analysis: Managerial heuristics often ""get it right""",Wübben M.; Wangenheim F.V.,2008,10.1509/jmkg.72.3.82,"Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models managerially more useful. © 2008, American Marketing Association.",Customer base analysis; Customer management; Direct marketing; Heuristics; Relationship marketing,,scopus-prediction
Competitive pricing of information: A longitudinal experiment,Christen M.; Sarvary M.,2007,10.1509/jmkr.44.1.42,"Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition between independent information sellers can result in prices that are negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers. © 2007, American Marketing Association.",,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
Antecedents of Export Venture Performance: A Theoretical Model and Empirical Assessment,Morgan N.A.; Kaleka A.; Katsikeas C.S.,2004,10.1509/jmkg.68.1.90.24028,"Both the size and the rapid growth of global exporting have focused the attention of marketing researchers on the factors associated with firms' export performance. However, knowledge of this increasingly important domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities, competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to structure-conduct-performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance. However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages realized.",,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction
The fallout from French nuclear testing in the South Pacific: A longitudinal study of consumer boycotts,Ettenson R.; Klein J.G.,2005,10.1108/02651330510593278,"Purpose - The frequency and sophistication of consumer boycotts continue to increase from already high levels. Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study 1 show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Brands; Consumer behaviour; International business,,scopus-prediction
"What influences prescriptions by physicians? A study of subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and volition",Van Der Geer L.; Kangis P.,2000,10.1057/palgrave.jmm.5040008,"Understanding how medical practitioners reach a decision on what to prescribe has been one of the more interesting areas of research for some time. Yet the accessible literature in this area is rather limited. Of particular interest is the assessment of the extent to which behaviour is entirely volitional and thus completely under the physician's control. This would determine the extent to which external stimuli, such as communications from the pharmaceutical industry and the media, have any influence or not. On the basis of a small-scale study with 38 physicians in Greece, the importance of isolating normative beliefs and the motivation to comply has been identified as a key factor to understanding the decision process for prescriptions. The evidence shows that prediction of intended prescription behaviour increases significantly when behavioural control is added to the measurements of attitude and subjective norm. In circumstances of high behavioural control, the theory of planned behaviour seems to collapse in favour of the theory of reasoned action. © 2000, SAGE Publications.

Supermarket pricing strategies,Ellickson P.B.; Misra S.,2008,10.1287/mksc.1080.0398,"Most supermarket firms choose to position themselves by offering either everyday low prices (EDLP) across several items or offering temporary price reductions (promotions) on a limited range of items. While this choice has been addressed from a theoretical perspective in both the marketing and economic literature, relatively little is known about how these decisions are made in practice, especially within a competitive environment. This paper exploits a unique store level data set consisting of every supermarket operating in the United States in 1998. For each of these stores, we observe the pricing strategy the firm has chosen to follow, as reported by the firm itself. Using a system of simultaneous discrete choice models, we estimate each store's choice of pricing strategy as a static discrete game of incomplete information. In contrast to the predictions of the theoretical literature, we find strong evidence that firms cluster by strategy by choosing actions that agree with those of its rivals. We also find a significant impact of various demographic and store/chain characteristics, providing some qualified support for several specific predictions from marketing theory. © 2008 INFORMS.",Discrete games; EDLP; Positioning strategies; Promotional pricing; Supermarkets,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Consumer cultural influence model: A proposal based on social axioms; [Modelo de influência cultural no consumo: Uma proposta baseada em axiomas sociais],Alfinito S.; Torres C.V.,2012,10.1590/S1678-69712012000500002,"Few are the efforts in Brazil directed towards the investigation of the relationship between consumers’ behaviors, values, and social beliefs (i.e, axioms), although there is evidence that in the country, consumer values also explain part of the consumption decision process, enhancing the cultural validity of the Two Route Model (TRM). This study’s objective was to evaluate the influence of cultural aspects in the buying decision, going beyond the TRM, and proposing the Consumer Cultural Influence Model (CCIM), which analyses the consumer choice based not only on values, but also on the social axioms construct, as proposed by Leung et al. (2002). To test the CCIM, the Brazilian higher education market was chose as study object. Participated in the study 2,483 students from the entire country, with an average age of 22.6 years old (SD = 6.9) and 59.2% of them female. They completed an importance of tangible attributes measure, the Schwartz Values Scale (SCHWARTZ, 1994), the Social Axioms Scale, the Services Meaning and Judgment Scale, and demographics questions. After checking whether the assumptions were met, and Factor Analyses procedures, binary logistic regressions, among direct and sequential, were accomplished using only values, only axioms, and finally, values and axioms as criteria variables. In general, results show the stability of the CCIM, its superiority towards the TRM, with an increase in prediction of up to 89.5%. Whilst values are transituational and prescriptive, axioms are descriptive, accomplishing instrumental functions of attitudes related to objects description. Cognitively, the description of a social object is more available to the person than its prediction, due to the proximity of the attributes to the object, allowing a better explanation of the consumer behavior. Results have implications to a more effective marketing positioning, as the survival in the market also depends on subjective aspects, such as those included in the CCIM. © 2012 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

The truth is out there! How external validity can lead to better marketing decisions,Rogers G.; Soopramanien D.,2009,10.2501/S1470785309200402,"Marketing managers typically have to use and integrate many pieces of data and marketing intelligence when taking decisions such as whether to launch a product and, if so, at what price. Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers' responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity - a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making.

Data collected from the Markstrat simulation support our predictions.

Compatibility effects in evaluations of satisfaction and loyalty,Auh S.; Johnson M.D.,2005,10.1016/j.joep.2003.10.002,"The goal of this research is to help understand the difference between satisfaction and loyalty based on the nature of the judgment tasks involved. By drawing on the notion of the prediction- decision inconsistency, we posit satisfaction as a consumption/experience utility and loyalty as a decision utility to explain the missing link between satisfaction and loyalty. An important assumption that may be driving the prediction-decision inconsistency, but has not been addressed, is the different criteria that consumers use in arriving at the two different types of utilities. The authors argue that this difference affects the compatibility, and resulting influence, of quality versus price information on satisfaction and loyalty evaluations.

Managerial risk perceptions of international entry-mode strategies: The interaction effect of control and capability,Forlani D.; Parthasarathy M.; Keaveney S.M.,2008,10.1108/02651330810877225,"Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate how opportunity for control and firm capability interact to moderate the amount of risk that managers associate with various international entry-mode strategies. A secondary goal is to investigate how managers perceive the need to retain control over three core functional areas (marketing, production, and R&D) when making entry-mode decisions. Design/methodology/approach - A field experiment design was implemented in a sample of US business owner/executives. Using an online data collection method, the study asked a sample of small-business owners and managers to assess the amount of risk they associated with three modes of entering the Japanese market: non-ownership (export), equal partnership (50/50 joint-venture), and sole-ownership. They were also asked how much control they needed to retain over R&D, production, and marketing for the venture to be successful. Findings - Ownership-provided control interacts with capability to influence managerial risk perceptions. Managers in lower-capability firms see the least risk in the non-ownership entry mode while those in higher-capability firms see the least risk in the equal-partnership entry mode. Managers believe that for a new venture in a foreign market to be successful, control should be retained over the R&D function, regardless of entry mode. Research limitations/implications - The findings appear to reconcile some of the conflicting predictions of the transaction cost and resource-based theoretical perspectives, because it appears that international managers consider both control (internationalization theory) and capability (resource-based theory) when judging the perceived risk of an entry strategy. Practical implications - For firms that are incapable of managing in an international context, a low-control no-ownership entry mode is perceived as the least risky approach; for firms that have some capability for international management, then a partial-ownership mode such as a 50/50 joint-venture is perceived as having lower risk than no-ownership. In non-ownership and joint-venture type entry modes, managers are more apt to outsource the marketing function to an agent/partner, but not R&D. In contrast, managers believe that marketing needs to be maintained in-house when utilizing a sole-ownership entry mode. Originality/value - By illustrating the role of perceived risk in foreign-market entry-mode decisions and demonstrating how capabilities interact with ownership-provided control to moderate these perceptions, the paper's findings suggest that managers' risk perceptions may mediate the effects of firm-specific factors, and thus contributes significantly to both theory and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Japan; Market entry; Marketing decision making; Overseas trade; Risk management; Small enterprises,,scopus-prediction
Consumption self-control by rationing purchase quantities of virtue and vice,Wertenbroch K.,1998,10.1287/mksc.17.4.317,"Consumers' attempts to control their unwanted consumption impulses influence many everyday purchases with broad implications for marketers' pricing policies. Addressing theoreticians and practitioners alike, this paper uses multiple empirical methods to show that consumers voluntarily and strategically ration their purchase quantities of goods that are likely to be consumed on impulse and that therefore may pose self-control problems. For example, many regular smokers buy their cigarettes by the pack, although they could easily afford to buy 10-pack cartons. These smokers knowingly forgo sizable per-unit savings from quantity discounts, which they could realize if they bought cartons; by rationing their purchase quantities, they also self-impose additional transactions costs on marginal consumption, which makes excessive smoking overly difficult and costly. Such strategic self-imposition of constraints is intuitively appealing yet theoretically problematic. The marketing literature lacks operationalizations and empirical tests of such consumption self-control strategies and of their managerial implications. This paper provides experimental evidence of the operation of consumer self-control and empirically illustrates its direct implications for the pricing of consumer goods. Moreover, the paper develops a conceptual frame-work for the design of empirical tests of such self-imposed constraints on consumption in consumer goods markets. Within matched pairs of products, we distinguish relative ""virtue"" and ""vice"" goods whose preference ordering changes with whether consumers evaluate immediate or delayed consumption consequences. For example, ignoring long-term health effects, many smokers prefer regular (relative vice) to light (relative virtue) cigarettes, because they prefer the taste of the former. However, ignoring these short-term taste differences, the same smokers prefer light to regular cigarettes when they consider the long-term health effects of smoking. These preference orders can lead to dynamically inconsistent consumption choices by consumers whose tradeoffs between the immediate and delayed consequences of consumption depend on the time lag between purchase and consumption. This creates a potential self-control problem, because these consumers will be tempted to overconsume the vices they have in stock at home. Purchase quantity rationing helps them solve the self-control Problem by limiting their stock and hence their consumption opportunities. Such rationing implies that, per purchase occasion, vice consumers will be less likely than virtue consumers to buy larger quantities in response to unit price reductions such as quantity discounts. We first test this prediction in two laboratory experiments. We then examine the external validity of the results at the retail level with a field survey of quantity discounts and with a scanner data analysis of chain-wide store-level demand across a variety of different pairs of matched vice (regular) and virtue (reduced fat, calorie, or caffeine, etc.) product categories. The analyses of these experimental, field, and scanner data provide strong convergent evidence of a characteristic crossover in demand schedules for relative vices and virtues for categories as diverse as, among others, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, cream cheese, beer, soft drinks, ice cream and frozen yogurt, chewing gum, coffee, and beef and turkey bologna. Vice consumers' demand increases less in response to price reductions than virtue consumers' demand, although their preferences are not generally weaker for vices than for virtues. Constraints on vice purchases are self-imposed and strategic rather than driven by simple preferences. We suggest that rationing their vice inventories at the point of purchase allows consumers to limit subsequent consumption. As a result of purchase quantity rationing, however, vice buyers forgo savings from price reductions through quantity discounts, effectively paying price premiums for the opportunity to engage in self-control. Thus, purchase quantity rationing vice consumers are relatively price insensitive. From a managerial and public policy perspective, our findings should offer marketing practitioners in many consumer goods industries new opportunities to increase profits through segmentation and price discrimination based on consumer self-control. They can charge premium prices for small sizes of vices, relative to the corresponding quantity discounts for virtues. Virtue consumers, on the other hand, will buy larger amounts even when quantity discounts are relatively shallow. A key conceptual contribution of this paper lies in showing how marketing researchers can investigate a whole class of strategic self-constraining consumer behaviors empirically. Moreover, this research is the first to extend previous, theoretical work on impulse control by empirically demonstrating its broader implications for marketing decision making.",Intertemporal choice; Pricing policy; Product policy; Segmentation; Self-control,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
The role of public policies in reducing smoking and deaths caused by smoking in Vietnam: Results from the Vietnam tobacco policy simulation model,Levy D.T.; Bales S.; Lam N.T.; Nikolayev L.,2006,10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.043,"A simulation model is developed for Vietnam to project smoking prevalence and associated premature mortality. The model examines independently and as a package the effects of five types of tobacco control policies: tax increases, clean air laws, mass media campaigns, advertising bans, and youth access policies. Predictions suggest that the largest reductions in smoking rates will result from implementing a comprehensive tobacco control policy package. Significant inroads may be achieved through tax increases. A media campaign along with programs to publicize and enforce clean air laws, advertising bans and youth access laws would further reduce smoking rates. Tobacco control policies have the potential to make large dents in smoking rates, which in turn could lead to many lives saved. In the absence of these measures, deaths from smoking will increase. The model also helps to identify information gaps pertinent both to modeling and policymaking. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A regime-switching model of cyclical category buying,Park S.; Gupta S.,2011,10.1287/mksc.1110.0643,"In many categories consumers display cyclical buying: they repeatedly purchase in the category for several periods, followed by several periods of not buying. We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of crosscategory substitution by the consumer, caused by ""variety-seeking"" tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high versus low purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3% households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions-customized timing of price reductions. © 2011 INFORMS.",Brand choice; Endogeneity; Heterogeneity; Logit model; Random coefficients; Scanner data; Simulated maximum likelihood,,scopus-prediction
An empirical examination of the decision to invest in fulfillment capabilities: A study of internet retailers,Randall T.; Netessine S.; Rudi N.,2006,10.1287/mnsc.1050.0493,"Internet technology has allowed for a higher degree of decoupling between the information-intensive sales process and the physical process of inventory management than its brick-and-mortar counterpart. As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices. © 2006 INFORMS.",Bankruptcy; Econometrics; Electronic commerce; Fulfillment; Hazard model; Internet; Retailing; Supply chain management,,scopus-prediction
Sales Analysis,Eardley-Simpson J.,1974,10.1108/EUM0000000005077,"The component parts of a sale—period, product, quantity, seller, place, customer, and terms of sale—contain within themselves information relationships whose significance tends to be hidden, or lost, through over-simplification of the idea of what a ‘sale’ is. Also, the forward-looking attitude encouraged by the marketing concept tends to demote past sales information to a role of short-term control of the selline function.

"Developing, exploring, and validating a typology of private philanthropic decision making",Supphellen M.; Nelson M.R.,2001,10.1016/S0167-4870(01)00056-3,"Previous research on charitable giving has devoted little attention to the fundamental question of how consumers actually respond to charitable donation requests via direct mail. Specifically, researchers have relied on the untested assumption that consumers engage in fairly extensive evaluations of requests. The present research challenges this assumption. By means of a simple scenario-technique, cognitive and behavioural responses to donation requests were first elicited from a sample of 90 consumers. A qualitative constant comparative analysis of responses resulted in the discovery of three different donor categories with different styles of decision-making: analysts (ANA), relationists (REL) and internalists (INT). ANA were characterised by high involvement and thorough evaluations of both the organisation behind a request and the specific cause promoted. REL were loyal to specific organisations and seldom attended to other information than the organisation behind the request. Interestingly, consumers in the final category, INT, neither evaluated the organisation nor the cause promoted. For these consumers, recognition of the requesting organisation was usually enough to trigger a positive response. In a follow-up survey including responses from more than 400 consumers, the typology of response styles was further explored and validated. In line with predictions from study 1, significant differences were observed in the ways ANA, REL and INT perceive, evaluate and give money to charitable organisations. The findings offer important implications for consumer psychology, public policy and charity marketing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",3920; 3940; Charity marketing; Decision making; Fund raising; L3; M3; Non-profit organisations,,scopus-prediction
What if I Find It Cheaper Someplace Else?: Role of Prefactual Thinking and Anticipated Regret in Consumer Behavior,McConnell A.R.; Niedermeier K.E.; Leibold J.M.; El-Alayli A.G.; Chin P.P.; Kuiper N.M.,2000,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6793(200004)17:4<281::AID-MAR2>3.0.CO;2-5,"Previous research has focused primarily on affect generated from counterfactual thinking after decisions have been made. The current study, in contrast, examined how predecision mental simulations (prefactuals) and feelings of anticipated regret are affected by different marketing strategies. A preliminary investigation found that consumers frequently produce upward prefactuals (e.g., if I buy it today and find it for less next week, I'll regret my purchase) when considering a major purchase. It was hypothesized that providing price guarantees would reduce upward prefactual generation and reduce anticipated regret. The primary investigation supported these predictions. When price guarantees were available, prefactuals were more downward in direction and negative affect was reduced. Also, price guarantees increased long-term satisfaction and happiness even when they were not exercised.

Real-Time Evaluation of E-mail Campaign Performance,Bonfrer A.; Drèze X.,2009,10.1287/mksc.1080.0393,"We develop a testing methodology that can be used to predict the performance of e-mail marketing campaigns in real time. We propose a split-hazard model that makes use of a time transformation (a concept we call virtual time) to allow for the estimation of straightforward parametric hazard functions and generate early predictions of an individual campaign's performance (as measured by open and click propensities). We apply this pretesting methodology to 25 e-mail campaigns and find that the method is able to produce in an hour and fifteen minutes estimates that are more accurate and more reliable than those that the traditional method (doubling time) produces after 14 hours. Other benefits of our method are that we make testing independent of the time of day and we produce meaningful confidence intervals. Thus, our methodology can be used not only for testing purposes, but also for live monitoring. The testing procedure is coupled with a formal decision theoretic framework to generate a sequential testing procedure useful for the real time evaluation of campaigns.© 2009 informs.",Advertising campaigns; Database marketing; E-mail; Pretesting,,scopus-prediction
More or less: A model and empirical evidence on preferences for under- and overpayment in trade-in transactions,Kim J.; Rao R.S.; Kim K.; Rao A.R.,2011,10.1509/jmkr.48.1.157,"Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Analytical models; Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Pricing; Trade-ins,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction

The effect of credit on spending decisions: The role of the credit limit and credibility,Soman D.; Cheema A.,2002,10.1287/mksc.21.1.32.155,"The objective of the present research is to study consumer decisions to utilize a line of credit. The life-cycle hypothesis from economics argues that consumers should intertemporally reallocate their incomes over their life stream to maximize lifetime utility. One form of intertemporal allocation is to use past income (in the form of savings) in the future. A second form is the use of future income in the present. This can only be done if consumers have access to a temporary pool of money that they can draw from and replenish in the future - a function performed by consumer credit. However, our research reinforces prior findings that consumers are unable to correctly value their future incomes, and that they lack the cognitive capability to solve the intertemporal optimization problem required by the life-cycle hypothesis. Instead, we argue that consumers use information such as the credit limit as a signal of their future earnings potential. Specifically, if consumers have access to large amounts of credit, they are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be high and hence their willingness to use credit (and their spending) will also be high. Conversely, consumers who are granted lower amounts of credit are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be low and hence their spending will be lower. However, based on research in the area of consumer skepticism and inference making, we also argue for a moderating role of the credibility associated with the credit limit. Specifically, we argue that the above effect of credit availability would be particularly strong for consumers who believe that the credit limit credibly signals their future earnings potential (i.e., a naïve consumer who has limited experience with consumer credit). However, as consumers gain experience with credit, they start discounting credit availability as a predictor of their future and start questioning the validity of the process used to set the credit limit. Hence, with experience the effect of credit limit on the willingness to use credit should be attenuated. We test these predictions in five separate studies. In the first experimental study, we manipulate credit limit and credibility and pose subjects with a hypothetical purchase opportunity. Consistent with our prediction, credit limit impacted the propensity to spend, but only when the credibility was high. In the second experimental study, we replicate these findings even when subjects were given information about their expected future salaries, and also show that the credit limit influences their expectation of future earnings potential. In the third study, we show that the mere availability (and increase) of current liquidity cannot explain our findings. In the fourth study, we conduct a survey of consumers in which we measure a number of demographic characteristics and also ask them for their propensity to spend in a given purchase situation. In the fifth study we use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset, a triennial survey of U.S. families that is designed to provide detailed information on the use of financial services, spending behaviors, and selected demographic characteristics. Results from both studies 4 and 5 provide further support for our proposed framework-credit limits influence spending to a greater extent for consumers with lower credibility: younger consumers and less-educated consumers. Across all studies we achieved triangulation by using a variety of approaches (surveys and experiments), subjects types (young students and older consumers), nature of predictor variables (manipulated and measured), dependent measures (purchase likelihood, credit card balance, new charges), and methods of analysis (ANOVA and regression), and consistently found that increasing credit limits on a credit card increases spending, especially when the credibility of the limit is high. This paper joins a growing body of literature in marketing and behavioral decision theory that goes beyond the traditional domains of inquiry (e.g., product choice, effects of marketing mix variables) and focuses on consumer decisions relating to the appropriate use of income to finance consumption. Our framework differs from prior research on the effect of payment mechanisms on spending in two significant ways. First, we are interested in the effects of the availability of credit on spending, and not necessarily in the effect of the transaction format that is associated with each payment mechanism. Second, while prior research has studied the point-of-purchase and historic (i.e., prepurchase) effects of credit, the present research is concerned with the availability of credit in the future. Specifically, our framework is invariant to the current and prior usage of credit by the consumer.",,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Market share constraints and the loss function in choice-based conjoint analysis,Gilbride T.J.; Lenk P.J.; Brazell J.D.,2008,10.1287/mksc.1080.0369,"Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be ""realistic"" in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or ""base-case"" scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base-case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base-case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because defining the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base-case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment. © 2008 INFORMS.",Bayesian decision theory; Conjoint analysis; Constrained optimization; Cross-validation; Hierarchical bayes; Loss function; Market share prediction; Penalized maximum likelihood; Posterior risk,,scopus-prediction
Decision-making under uncertainty: Capturing dynamic brand choice processes in turbulent consumer goods markets,Erdem T.; Keane M.P.,1996,10.1287/mksc.15.1.1,"We construct two models of the behavior of consumers in an environment where there is uncertainty about brand attributes. In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ""forward-looking"" model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent. We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run. The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ""structural"" estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ""structural"" models. A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change. Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.",Advertising; Brand choice; Buyer Behavior; Choice Models; Econometric Modelling; Information Processing,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Optimal decision making for online referral marketing,Guo Z.,2012,10.1016/j.dss.2011.09.004,"Widely available web 2.0 technologies not only bring rich and interactive user experiences, but also easily help users advertise products or services on their own blogs and social network webpages. Online referral marketing, for example, is a business practice that rewards customers who successfully refer other customers to a website or upon completion of a sale usually via their own social contacts. The referral rewards come in different forms such as shopping vouchers, redeemable points, discounts, prizes, cash payments, etc. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the business potential of incorporating an online referral marketing program into the firm's product selling strategies. Under different demand dynamics, we investigate the optimal decision making including the pricing and referral strategies to maximize the seller's profitability. We find that, under simple decision making environment such as fixed product price and myopic strategy, different demand dynamics yield the same prediction of the referral payment, which turns out to be a static policy. However, under complex market situations, both the optimal product pricing and referral offering critically depend on the demand side dynamics. Under the nonlinear demand dynamics, the referral payment is an all-or-nothing decision throughout the product selling horizon. In contrast, under the linear demand assumption, the referral payment can be partially offered in initial phase of the product introduction. We further offer some managerial insights to guide practical implementation of the online referral marketing strategy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

MOVIEMOD: An implementable decision-support system for prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures,Eliashberg J.; Jonker J.-J.; Sawhney M.S.; Wierenga B.,2000,10.1287/mksc.19.3.226.11796,"In spite of the high financial stakes involved in marketing new motion pictures, marketing science models have not been applied to the prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures. The motion picture industry poses some unique challenges. For example, the consumer adoption process for movies is very sensitive to word-of-mouth interactions, which are difficult to measure and predict before the movie has been released. In this article, we undertake the challenge to develop and implement MOVIEMOD - a prerelease market evaluation model for the motion picture industry. MOVIEMOD is designed to generate box-office forecasts and to support marketing decisions for a new movie after the movie has been produced (or when it is available in a rough cut) but before it has been released. Unlike other forecasting models for motion pictures, the calibration of MOVIEMOD does not require any actual sales data. Also, the data collection time for a product with a limited lifetime such as a movie should not take too long. For MOVIEMOD it takes only three hours in a ""consumer clinic"" to collect the data needed for the prediction of box-office sales and the evaluation of alternative marketing plans. The model is based on a behavioral representation of the consumer adoption process for movies as a macroflow process. The heart of MOVIEMOD is an interactive Markov chain model describing the macro-flow process. According to this model, at any point in time with respect to the movie under study, a consumer can be found in one of the following behavioral states: undecided, considerer, rejecter, positive spreader, negative spreader, and inactive. The progression of consumers through the behavioral states depends on a set of movie-specific factors that are related to the marketing mix, as well as on a set of more general behavioral factors that characterize the movie-going behavior in the population of interest. This interactive Markov chain model allows us to account for word-of-mouth interactions among potential adopters and several types of word-of-mouth spreaders in the population. Marketing variables that influence the transitions among the states are movie theme acceptability, promotion strategy, distribution strategy, and the movie experience. The model is calibrated in a consumer clinic experiment. Respondents fill out a questionnaire with general items related to their movie-going and movie communication behavior, they are exposed to different sets of information stimuli, they are actually shown the movie, and finally, they fill out postmovie evaluations, including word-of-mouth intentions. These measures are used to estimate the word-of-mouth parameters and other behavioral factors, as well as the movie-specific parameters of the model. MOVIEMOD produces forecasts of the awareness, adoption intention, and cumulative penetration for a new movie within the population of interest for a given base marketing plan. It also provides diagnostic information on the likely impact of alternative marketing plans on the commercial performance of a new movie. We describe two applications of MOVIEMOD: One is a pilot study conducted without studio cooperation in the United States, and the other is a full-fledged implementation conducted with cooperation of the movie's distributor and exhibitor in the Netherlands. The implementations suggest that MOVIEMOD produces reasonably accurate forecasts of box-office performance. More importantly, the model offers the opportunity to simulate the effects of alternative marketing plans. In the Dutch application, the effects of extra advertising, extra magazine articles, extra TV commercials, and higher trailer intensity (compared to the base marketing plan of the distributor) were analyzed. We demonstrate the value of these decision-support capabilities of MOVIEMOD in assisting managers to identify a final plan that resulted in an almost 50% increase in the test movie's revenue performance, compared to the marketing plan initially contemplated. Management implemented this recommended plan, which resulted in box-office sales that were within 5% of the MOVIEMOD prediction. MOVIEMOD was also tested against several benchmark models, and its prediction was better in all cases. An evaluation of MOVIEMOD jointly by the Dutch exhibitor and the distributor showed that both parties were positive about and appreciated its performance as a decision-support tool. In particular, the distributor, who has more stakes in the domestic performance of its movies, showed a great interest in using MOVIEMOD for subsequent evaluations of new movies prior to their release. Based on such evaluations and the initial validation results, MOVIEMOD can fruitfully (and inexpensively) be used to provide researchers and managers with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive audience response to new motion pictures, and it can be instrumental in developing other decision-support systems that can improve the odds of commercial success of new experiential products.",Decision support; Forecasting; Markov chains; Motion pictures; New products; Pretest market evaluation,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction

This has led experts to highlight the existence of a ""long tail"" of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is ""selling less of more."" However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The time-harried shopper: Exploring the differences between maximizers and satisficers,Chowdhury T.G.; Ratneshwar S.; Mohanty P.,2009,10.1007/s11002-008-9063-0,"Schwartz and his colleagues have proposed individual differences in consumer decision goals. Maximizers are those who always strive to make the best possible decision, whereas satisficers are those who are usually willing to settle for a ""good enough"" option. In this study, we explore the influence of the maximizing trait in situations where consumers have to make quick purchase decisions. The context for our empirical study is online gift purchases made under a time constraint. The results support our predictions that maximizers (vs. satisficers) engage in more prepurchase browsing behavior and also perceive more decision time pressure. Furthermore, these effects are moderated by the size of the available choice assortment. The results also show that maximizers are more likely to change their initial time-constrained choices if given the opportunity to do so. We discuss the implications of the research for the study of individual differences in consumer behavior and also for customizing retail sales and Internet marketing tactics based on buyer segmentation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Assortment size; Browsing behavior; Consumer decision making; Maximizing trait; Time pressure,,scopus-prediction
Determinants of Revenue-Reporting Practices for Internet Firms,Bowen R.M.; Davis A.K.; Rajgopal S.,2002,10.1506/9728-4YG8-GC3L-FPFA,"The financial press and accounting regulators (e.g., the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Accounting Standards Board) have expressed concern about pressures on Internet firms to report high levels of revenue. This study verifies the association between market capitalization and revenue, and examines economic factors that potentially influence Internet company managers' decisions to adopt allegedly aggressive revenue-recognition policies. Specifically, we examine factors hypothesized to influence the reporting of advertising barter revenue and grossed-up sales levels. We begin by providing descriptive evidence on the use of barter and grossed-up revenue across Internet sectors. Although common in some sectors, we find that the use of these accounting policies is not pervasive overall. We limit our empirical analyses to Internet companies that have the opportunity to report grossed-up or advertising barter revenue. Our cross-sectional predictions are based on both external and internal incentives to maximize revenues as well as constraints that may limit management's discretion. We predict that the following factors increase the likelihood that a firm will report grossed-up and/or barter revenue: shorter time before needing additional external financing, more active individual investor interest in the firm's stock, more active pursuit of growth via acquisitions, and greater use of stock options in employee compensation. We also posit that barter transactions might be an inexpensive way for firms to evaluate the viability of future marketing or content alliances with potential partners. Finally, we predict that constraints on management discretion are related to the reputation/quality of the firm's auditor and underwriter and the extent of management ownership. We find that firms with greater cash burn rates and higher levels of activity on Motley Fool message boards are consistently associated with barter and grossed-up revenue reporting.",,,scopus-prediction
What people want (and how to predict It),Davenport T.H.; Harris J.G.,2009,,"Historically, neither the creators nor the distributors of cultural products such as books or movies have used analytics - data, statistics, predictive modeling - to determine the likely success of their offerings. Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation. They then discuss two aspects of the prediction market. First, the need for better prediction for distributors of cultural products, and second, the potential for business models around prediction techniques.

Valenced Attributions and Risk in New-Product Decisions: How Why Indicates What's Next,Forlani D.; Walker Jr. O.C.,2003,10.1002/mar.10079,"Based in a new-product decision-making context, this article poses the question, ""how, and to what extent, do prior outcomes, and the reasons given to account for those outcomes, influence a marketing manager's future new-product selection (choice) and support (dollar commitment) decisions?"" The study's hypotheses are developed by integrating the motivational qualities of Weiner's attribution theory with the behavioral predictions of four popular risk perspectives: prospect theory, the hot-hand effect, the competency hypothesis, and risk as hazard. The research question is reflected in two sets of hypotheses that experimentally examine the relationship between valenced (was the outcome good or bad) attributions (why did the outcome happen) and changes in the riskiness (chance and size of loss) of managers' new-product introduction decisions. Three-way interactions are found that support the study's attribution-based framework and address predictive differences among the four risk perspectives. Implications for the theories examined and the management of the new-product development process are discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,scopus-prediction
Optimal choice of promotional vehicles: front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives?,Zhang Z.J.; Krishna A.; Dhar S.K.,2000,10.1287/mnsc.46.3.348.12062,"We examine the key factors that influence a firm's decision whether to use front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives. When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage. The data in both studies are consistent with the model predictions.",,INFORMS,scopus-prediction
Manufacturer-specific asset investments and inter-firm governance forms: An empirical test of the contingent effect of exchange frequency,Buvik A.,2002,10.1300/J033v09n04_02,"Transaction cost analysis (TCA) keeps the frequency of exchange as a significant dimension of business-to-business transactions, and the transaction frequency is expected to influence how to align inter-firm organization efficiently. To date, transaction frequency has received little attention in empirical TCA-studies. This research focuses in particular on order frequency in industrial purchasing relationships and how it affects the alignment of purchase contracting and hierarchical governance in supplier-manufacturer relationships. Data from a survey of 160 industrial purchasing relationships supports the basic TCA prediction stating that increased transaction frequency will provide administrative economies of scale benefits under conditions with substantial hazards of trade. The empirical findings demonstrate that the association between manufacturer-specific assets and formalized purchase contracting is highly dependent on the present level of exchange frequency. In manufacturer-supplier relationships with modest exchange frequency, there is no significant association between asset specificity and contractual governance. On the other hand, the effect of manufacturer-specific assets on formalized purchase contracting was substantial in relationships with high order frequency. This governance pattern was replicated in the analysis of hierarchical governance. Substantial investments in manufacturer-specific assets enforced the manufacturer's decision control over the supplier under conditions with high exchange frequency. The research provides further insight into the economics of inter-firm organization and supports the TCA-based assumption asserting that the frequency of inter-firm exchange improves the utilization of specialized governance arrangements in business to business relationships. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Applying hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys at Parker Pen to enhance new product success,Tomkovick C.; Dobie K.E.,1995,10.1016/0737-6782(95)00028-R,"Walking the path from new product concept to successful commercialization is a tightrope act. Product developers must carefully balance a variety of factors, including predictions of consumer price sensitivity as well as which combination of product attributes will be most valued by the intended market. A well-chosen mix of analytical tools can enhance a firm's chances of accurately predicting market demand. Chuck Tomkovick and Kathryn E. Dobie describe how the integration of two product attribute assessment techniques-hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys-allows product designer to more accurately gauge price sensitivity and market receptivity to new product designs. They also describe how these analytical tools were used to improve decision-making in product development at the Parker Pen Company, and they discuss the role these tools can play in facilitating the transition from concept to commercialization. Hedonic price analysis is an econometric method for determining the value purchasers place on attributes of existing products. In product development, factorial surveys are used to identify the value members of the target market place on new product concepts and prototypes. When used in combination with identified hedonic prices, the responses to a factorial survey allow product developers to predict consumer willingness-to-pay for various combinations of new product attributes. Following development of prototypes for two new product lines, product developers at the Parker Pen Company used hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys as a means for reducing demand uncertainty and for clarifying what consumers were willing to pay for various combinations of product attributes that were under consideration. The integration and use of these techniques involved a five-step process of target market identification, product attribute identification, hedonic price estimation, administering of the factorial survey, and determination of consumer willingness-to-pay. The results of these analyses allowed Parker Pen to better focus product development efforts on those design elements for which test market customers indicated both demand and willingness-to-pay. The Parker Pen Company found hedonic pricing and factorial surveys useful for predicting both the rat and the degree of change in consumers' marginal utility for specific product attributes. The usefulness of these techniques also extends beyond the early stages of new product conception. These techniques are helpful in the development and implementation of dynamic new product marketing mix strategies, including such elements as product design, pricing, channel selection, and promotion. © 1995.",,,scopus-prediction
A Bayesian model to forecast new product performance in domestic and international markets,Neelamegham R.; Chintagunta P.,1999,10.1287/mksc.18.2.115,"This paper attempts to shed light on the following research questions: When a firm introduces a new product (or service) how can it effectively use the different information sources available to generate reliable new product performance forecasts? How can the firm account for varying information availability at different stages of the new product launch and generate forecasts at each stage? We address these questions in the context of the sequential launches of motion pictures in international markets. Players in the motion picture industry require forecasts at different stages of the movie launch process to aid decision-making, and the information sets available to generate such forecasts vary at different stages. Despite the importance of such forecasts, the industry struggles to understand and predict sales of new movies in domestic and overseas markets. We develop a Bayesian modeling framework that predicts first-week viewership for new movies in both domestic and several international markets. We focus on the first week because industry players involved in international markets (studios, distributors, and exhibitors) are most interested in these predictions. We draw on existing literature on forecasting performance of new movies to formulate our model. Specifically, we model the number of viewers of a movie in a given week using a Poisson count data model. The number of screens, distribution strategy, movie attributes such as genre, and presence/absence of stars are among the factors modeled to influence viewership. We employ a hierarchical Bayes formulation of the Poisson model that allows the determinants of viewership to vary across countries. We adopt the Bayesian approach for two reasons: First, it provides a convenient framework to model varying assumptions of information availability; specifically, it allows us to make forecasts by combining different sources of information such as domestic and international market-specific data. Second, this methodology provides us with the entire distribution of the new movie's performance forecast. Such a predictive distribution is more informative than a point estimate and provides a measure of the uncertainty in the forecasts. We propose a Bayesian prediction procedure that provides viewership forecasts at different stages of the new movie release process. The methodology provides forecasts under a number of information availability scenarios. Thus, forecasts can be obtained with just information from a historical database containing data on previous new product launches in several international markets. As more information becomes available, the forecasting methodology allows us to combine historical information with data on the performance of the new product in the domestic market and thereby to make forecasts with less uncertainty and greater accuracy. Our results indicate that for all the countries in the data set the number of screens on which a movie is released is the most important influence on viewership. Furthermore, we find that local distribution improves movie sales internationally in contrast to the domestic market. We also find evidence of similar genre preferences in geographically disparate countries. We find that the proposed model provides accurate forecasts at the movie-country level. Further, the model outperforms all the extant models in the marketing literature that could potentially be used for making these forecasts. A comparison of root mean square and mean absolute errors for movies in a hold out sample shows that the model that combines information available from the different sources generates the lowest errors. A Bayesian predictive model selection criterion corroborates the superior performance of this model. We demonstrate that the Bayesian model can be combined with industry rules of thumb to generate cumulative box office forecasts. In summary, this research demonstrates a Bayesian modeling framework that allows the use of different information sources to make new product forecasts in domestic and international markets. Our results underscore the theme that each movie is unique as is each country-and viewership results from an interaction of the product and the market. Hence, the motion picture industry should use both product-specific and market-specific information to make new movie performance forecasts.",Forecasting; Hierarchical Bayes; International Markets; Motion Pictures; New Products,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
The value of marketing expertise,Paşa M.; Shugan S.M.,1996,10.1287/mnsc.42.3.370,"This paper has three objectives: (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model by observing how different market conditions influence whether companies emphasize marketing expertise. We accomplish these objectives as follows. First, we use decision theory to find an expression for the expected value of marketing expertise. We do not use decision-analysis in the normative tradition. Nor do we assume that firms actually use formal decision-analysis. Rather, we assume that firms are rational and that decision theory describes their actions. Given that assumption, we predict how firms should evaluate marketing. Here, marketing expertise helps a firm make better marketing decisions (at least on average). Hence, the value of marketing expertise increases as marketing decisions become more important. Second, consistent with decision theory, we predict that marketing decisions become more important with increases in the instability of the marketing environment (i.e., predictability), the profit impact of marketing decisions (i.e., opportunity profit), and the loss from marketing mistakes (i.e., potential loss). Third, we construct empirical measures of our theoretical constructs with data from 592 firms. Our empirical results are consistent with our predictions and reveal factors influencing the value of marketing expertise. For example, greater market instability and market presence increase the value of marketing expertise, while larger organization size, organization instability, and competition decrease its value.",Decision Analysis; Expertise; Marketing; Value,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction

The Truth is Out There! How External Validity Can Lead to Better Marketing Decisions,Rogers G.; Soopramanien D.,2009,10.1177/147078530905100216,"Marketing managers typically have to use and integrate many pieces of data and marketing intelligence when taking decisions such as whether to launch a product and, if so, at what price. Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers’ responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity – a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making. In this research, a case study is used as an example to demonstrate how marketing managers can use the information from a choice-based conjoint derived choice model differently depending on the manner in which the model validation is carried out. © 2009 Market Research Society.",,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-prediction
A new logit model for decision making and its application,Coskunoglu O.; Hansotia B.J.; Shaikh M.A.,1985,10.1057/jors.1985.5,"Logit models attempt to answer the following question. Given a set of alternatives, each with multiple attributes, what is the probability that a decision maker will choose a certain alternative? Initially psychologists, then economists and marketing strategists, more recently transportation policy makers and design engineers have employed logit models. A brief review of these models is given in an attempt to show their relevance to more general decision-making situations, and their descriptiveness of human decision-making processes. A new model which synthesizes the desirable features of earlier models is then presented. The new model is applied to an actual case of predicting customer purchase probabilities for a particular brand of an industrial product. The prediction capability of the model is externally validated statistically, using real data, by comparing model results with the actual market share of the company. © 1985 Operational Research Society Ltd.",Decision making; Marketing; Probabilistic choice; Utility theory,,scopus-prediction
College applicants' attitudes and enrollment decisions,Trusheim D.; Crouse J.; Middaugh M.,1990,10.1007/BF00992314,"One potentially useful multivariate procedure somewhat overlooked in admissions marketing efforts is a linear compensatory model presented by Cook and Zallocco (1983). This model defines an individual's attitude about a particular college or university as the importance the individual attaches to a specific attribute of the school, and the belief that the institution under consideration possesses that attribute. In this study we extend the model by investigating the importance of applicants' attitudes about competitor institutions, and by controlling for demographic and ability factors that may affect attitudes. Our research demonstrates that attitudes have a significant, positive relationship to enrollment decisions. As well, we incorporate an attitude difference measure that contrasts applicants' attitudes about one institution compared to admissions competitors.

Specifically, we manipulate the number of consumer recommendations and measure motivation to process information in a realistic online shopping environment. Consistent with predictions of dual information processing theories, we find that the amount of eWOM has a significant impact on buyer confidence in product choice. In addition, we find that for buyers less motivated to process information, the effect of eWOM on their choice confidence is mediated by their attitude towards the recommended product, suggesting that the amount of eWOM functions as a purchase cue. Our findings have theoretical implications regarding the processes underlying eWOM effectiveness and practical implications for online retailers and policy-makers. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.",Customer recommendations; Electronic marketing; Electronic Word-of-Mouth; EWom; Heuristic processing; Involvement; Motivation to process information; Peripheral processing; Retailing,Inderscience Publishers,scopus-prediction
Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to entry in different competitive game structures: Theoretical analysis and empirical illustration,Shankar V.,1997,10.1287/mksc.16.3.271,"Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to new entries are recognized as important determinants of the outcome of pioneer-late mover competition, particularly in price-inelastic markets such as those for pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, and luxury goods. Managers in such markets are interested in better understanding when to accommodate (i.e., decrease marketing spending) or retaliate (i.e., increase spending) in nonprice marketing variables such as advertising and salesforce. In addition, the reallocation of marketing resources toward advertising (indicated by a pull strategy) or salesforce (indicated by a push strategy) upon entry is strategically important to managers. Previous theoretical research shows that pioneers should retaliate in both static and growing markets. Results from empirical research are mixed in that they support both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets. Empirical research also shows that a pioneer accommodates (retaliates) with its low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Contrary to prior research, however, some pioneers have successfully accommodated late movers in growing markets, and in some cases, have accommodated with their stronger marketing mix variables and also retaliated with their weaker marketing mix variables. For example, Bristol Myers Squibb's Capoten accommodated the entry of Merck's Vasotec in the growing ace-inhibitors market with its more powerful variable, salesforce, but also retaliated with its less potent variable, advertising. Moreover, not much is known about how the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should change (i.e., toward pull vs. push strategies) in response to new entries. We seek to better explain the pioneer's reactions and predict its shift in marketing mix allocation upon new entry. We note that prior research's predictions on the pioneer's reactions are based on a limited number of key factors such as product-market characteristics and the pioneer's elasticities prior to a new entry. In this paper, we extend previous research by adding two other critical factors, namely, the impact of new entry on the pioneer's elasticities and margin, and different competitive game structures to better predict and explain the pioneer's reactions. We develop analytical results on the pioneer's reactions in price, advertising, and salesforce in different competitive games (both Nash and different leader-follower games). In these results we identify the conditions under which the pioneer should accommodate, or retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift its marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies. We empirically illustrate some of the analytical results using data from a pharmaceutical category. We show that a pioneer who adopts a follower (leader) role with respect to a marketing mix variable in a static (growing) market, and witnesses a decrease (an increase) in own elasticity and margin upon a new entry, generally should accommodate (retaliate) in that variable. However, we are also able to show that there are cases where these general reactions don't hold. Thus, for example, it is possible for a pioneer to find it optimal to accommodate in a growing market or to retaliate even when its elasticity decreases upon entry, depending on the combination of competitive game, the impact of entry on elasticities and margin, and market growth. In this way, our results point to the fact that it is necessary to look not only at one factor at a time, but instead examine the combination of all the factors. We explain the empirical support for both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets by showing that the pioneer should accommodate (retaliate) a late mover with its competitively low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Competitively high (low) elasticity variables are not (are) likely to be significantly reduced by a new entry in the anticipated competitive game. With regard to reallocation of the pioneer's marketing mix, we show that the change in the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should follow the change in the relative marketing mix effectiveness after new entry. This, in turn, depends on the structure of competition, the impact of the late mover on its elasticities and margins, and the competitor's marketing mix elasticities, in addition to own elasticities. The results can guide managers on how factors such as competitive structure, changes in elasticities and margin, and market growth impact the pioneer's marketing mix decisions, and on when to accommodate, retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies.",Competitive Strategy; Defensive Strategy; Econometric Models; Game Theory; Marketing Mix; Resource Allocation Policy,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction

Development of a framework for industrial service innovation management and coordination,Panesar S.S.; Markeset T.,2008,10.1108/13552510810877674,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify different service innovation drivers, innovation process activities and to understand industrial services innovation management and coordination, as well as to develop a framework for industrial service innovation management and coordination. Design/methodology/approach - The study involved collection of information and data from the literature and the Norwegian oil and gas (O&G) industry. A survey was conducted to get an overview of existing practices and guided interviews were conducted to confirm the findings of the survey. Findings - The study indicates that the market needs are considered the most important innovation process driver, feedback from the customers is the most important activity to encourage service innovations, whilst return on investments is the most important decision-making factor in evaluating innovation feasibility. Employees are the most important source of innovation ideas. Furthermore, interactions between different companies, as well as involvement of customer, employees and suppliers in the innovation process are becoming increasingly important. Practical implications - The study shows that service providers and receivers often collaborate in the innovation processes, and that many of the activities are performed simultaneously. This results in the collaborative parties needing to put resources on managing and coordinating the innovation process in a structured, effective and efficient way. The proposed framework for service innovation management and coordination provides practitioners with a structured approach to manage industrial service innovations. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on the data collected from a number of companies from the O&G industry in Norway.

Pricing decisions under demand uncertainty: A Bayesian mixture model approach,Kalyanam K.,1996,10.1287/mksc.15.3.207,"The advent of optical scanning devices and decreases in the cost of computing power have made it possible to assemble databases with sales and marketing mix information in an accurate and timely manner. These databases enable the estimation of demand functions and pricing/promotion decisions in ""real"" time. Commercial suppliers of marketing research like A. C. Nielsen and IRI are embedding estimated demand functions in promotion planning and pricing tools for brand managers and retailers. This explosion in the estimation and use of demand functions makes it timely and appropriate to re-examine several fundamental issues. In particular, demand functions are latent theoretical constructs whose exact parametric form is unknown. Estimates of price elasticities, profit maximizing prices, interbrand competition and other policy implications are conditional on the parametric form assumed in estimation. In practice, many forms may be found that are not only theoretically plausible but also consistent with the data. The different forms could suggest different profit maximizing prices leaving it unclear as to what is the appropriate pricing action. Specification tests may lack the power to resolve this uncertainty, particularly for non-nested comparisons. Also, the structure of these tests does not permit seamless integration of estimation, specification analysis and optimal pricing into a unified framework. As an alternative to the existing approaches, I propose a Bayesian mixture model (BMM) that draws on Bayesian estimation, inference, and decision theory, thereby providing a unified framework. The BMM approach consists of input, estimation, diagnostic and optimal pricing modules. In the input module, alternate parametric models of demand are specified along with priors. Utility structures representing the decision maker's attitude towards risk can be explicitly specified. In the estimation module, the inputs are combined with data to compute parameter estimates and posterior probabilities for the models. The diagnostic module involves testing the statistical assumptions underlying the models. In the optimal pricing module the estimates and posterior probabilities are combined with the utility structure to arrive at optimal pricing decisions. Formalizing demand uncertainty in this manner has many important payoffs. While the classical approaches emphasize choosing a demand specification, the BMM approach emphasizes constructing an objective function that represents a mixture of the specifications. Hence, pricing decisions can be arrived at even when there is no consensus among the different parametric specifications. The pricing decisions will reflect parametric demand uncertainty, and hence be more robust than those based on a single demand model. The BMM approach was empirically evaluated using store level scanner data. The decision context was the determination of equilibrium wholesale prices in a noncooperative game between several leading national brands. Retail demand was parametrized as semilog and doublelog with diffuse priors for the models and the parameters. Wholesale demand functions were derived by incorporating the retailers' pricing behavior in the retail demand function. Utility functions reflecting risk averse and risk neutral decision makers were specified. The diagnostic module confirms that face validity measures, residual analysis, classical tests or holdout predictions were unable to resolve the uncertainty about the parametric form and by implication the uncertainty with regard to pricing decisions. In contrast, the posterior probabilities were more conclusive and favored the specification that predicted better in a holdout analysis. However, across the brands, they lacked a systematic pattern of updating towards any one specification. Also, none of the priors updated to zero or one, and there was considerable residual uncertainty about the parametric specification. Despite the residual uncertainty, the BMM approach was able to determine the equilibrium wholesale prices. As expected, specifications influence the BMM pricing solutions in accordance with their posterior probabilities which act as weights. In addition, differing attitudes towards risk lead to considerable divergence in the pricing actions of the risk averse and the risk neutral decision maker. Finally, results from a Monte Carlo experiment suggest that the BMM approach performs well in terms of recovering potential improvements in profits.",Bayesian econometrics; Decision theory; Demand structures; Nonnested models; Pricing; Regression; Scanner data,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction
Multiple generation product life cycle predictions using a novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method,Huang C.-Y.; Tzeng G.-H.,2008,10.1016/j.techfore.2007.07.005,"Product life cycle (PLC) prediction plays a crucial role in strategic planning and policy definition for high-technology products. Forecast methodologies which can predict PLCs accurately can help to achieve successful strategic decision-making, forecasting, and foresight activities in high-technology firms, research institutes, governments, and universities. Over the past few decades, even though analytic framework strategies have been proposed for production, marketing, R&D (research and development), and finance, aiming at each stage of PLCs, forecast methodologies with which to predict PLCs are few. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel forecast methodology to allow for predictions of product life time (PLT) and the annual shipment of products during the entire PLC of multiple generation products. A novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, the product life-time of the specific generation to be analyzed will be predicted by the fuzzy piecewise regression line that is derived based upon the product life-time of earlier generations. In the second stage of the forecast methodology, the annual shipment of products of the specified generation will be predicted by deriving annual fuzzy regression lines for each generation, based upon the historical data on the earlier generations' products. An empirical study predicting the life-time and the annual shipment of the 16 Mb (Mega bit) DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) PLC is illustrated to validate the analytical process. The results demonstrate that two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis can predict multiple generation PLT and PLC precisely, thereby serving as a foundation for future strategic planning, policy definitions and foresights. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Sales forecasting in high-technology markets: A utility-based approach,Decker R.; Gnibba-Yukawa K.,2010,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2009.00703.x,"Accurate sales projections are of vital importance to the profitability and long-term survival of high-tech companies. This is especially true in the growth stage of product innovation, because major investments and marketing decisions are made in this phase. By examining recent empirical studies focusing on consumer behavior in high-technology markets, several factors are identified that can affect individual buying decisions and aggregate sales, namely, interpersonal communication, democratization of innovation, direct and indirect network effects, forward-looking behavior, and consumer heterogeneity. Against this background the diffusion-modeling and the utility-based approach are reviewed in terms of their basic conception and their applicability to the markets concerned. Based on this investigation a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, specifically in the growth stage, is developed. The model has a utility-theoretic background and a logistic structure. Since data are scarce in this early stage of the product life cycle two versions of the new approach are discussed, an extended version considering forward-looking behavior and a more parsimonious (""myopic"") one. The performance of the new model is demonstrated using real sales data on the CD player, the DVD player/recorder, and the digital camera market. The empirical comparisons include alternative specifications of the Bass diffusion model as well as a proportional hazard model and consist of two steps. First, the models are checked as to whether they are able to represent the sales data at all. It is shown that both versions of the proposed model are at least equivalent, if not superior, to the models used as benchmarks in terms of fit. In the next step, the models are applied to predict future sales in the three markets. The resulting forecasts show that the proposed model performs significantly better than its benchmarks. Its parsimony enables reliable predictions, even in cases, where only short time series are available for parameter estimation. The model is able to anticipate decreasing diffusion rates as they occur at the end of the growth stage and, thus, helps to avoid overoptimistic sales forecasts, which may cause severe economic damages. The new approach is easy to calibrate and can be applied without specialized econometric expertise. © 2009 Product Development & Management Association.",,,scopus-prediction

Fashion change and fashion consumption: The chaotic perspective,Ming Law K.; Zhang Z.-M.; Leung C.-S.,2004,10.1108/13612020410559966,"Previous researches have considered that the impact of fashion change and fashion consumption is linear. Therefore, one reason was found as the ultimate source to explain why a fashion style/ trend was spread to the mass market. However, the existing market is complex and difficult to find out the holistic reason to explain fashion consumption. In this study, the chaotic perspective is taken into account to investigate the relationship between fashion change and fashion consumption. By using the grounded theory method, 33 in-depth interviews were conducted. A chaotic fashion consumption model is developed from the findings to explain how different fashions are consumed and rejected while fashion changes. It is found that the interaction of being fashionable, perceived fashionability and system participation affects the ultimate decision on fashion consumption. It is also found that a pattern can be traced to forecast the degree of fashion consumption even when the fashion change phenomenon is chaotic. Thus, it is similar to the principle of chaos theory that short-term prediction is possible in relation to the degree of fashion acceptance among consumers. Marketing implications are suggested with reference to the chaotic fashion consumption model. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Consumers; Fashion; Social change; Young adults,,scopus-prediction

Strategic options of home country firms faced with MNC entry,Jaffe E.D.; Nebenzahl I.D.; Schorr I.,2005,10.1016/j.lrp.2004.11.013,"This article analyses the strategic options facing a domestic firm threatened by the entry of MNCs - whether to attack the incoming MNC, to cooperate with it, to defend their home position or to exit the market. The authors suggest a framework for determining an optimum strategy based on the firm's market (global or local) and the strength of its strategic and marketing assets. They test the framework by studying the response strategies to MNC entry of 78 Israeli firms, tracking their reactions from 1993 to 1999, as significantly more MNCs entered the market. Was the model able to predict which strategies were selected by the firms? For firms competing in global markets, barely half of those with strong assets chose to 'contend' with MNCs as predicted. The rest chose a 'cooperator' strategy, as did all firms with weak assets (in line with model predictions). For firms competing locally, the majority with strong assets followed the predicted 'contester' strategy, and the majority with weak assets chose a 'defender' strategy, again in accordance with the model.

Expression of green marketing developing the conception of corporate social responsibility; [žaliojo marketingo raiška plėtojant įmonių socialinės atsakomybės koncepciją],Banyte J.; Brazioniene L.; Gadeikiene A.,2010,,"Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and ""clean"" products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise - consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.",Corporate social responsibility; Green consumer; Green marketing; Lithuanian market of ecofriendly food products,Kauno Technologijos Universitetas,scopus-prediction
Brand positivity and competitive effects on the evaluation of brand extensions,Kapoor H.; Heslop L.A.,2009,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2009.05.001,"The dominant approach in brand-extension research has focused on the role of fit in the extension evaluation process. Overemphasis on fit has resulted in research designs that involve singular evaluation of the extension without considering how competing brands in the target category might affect the evaluation of brand extensions. Singular evaluations are known to result in brand positivity effects; that is, brand extensions are evaluated more favorably than is warranted. This research finds that singular evaluations do indeed lead to brand positivity effects. However, brand positivity effects are mitigated when respondents were provided with competitive information along with target-category structure and comparative/non-comparative brand positioning statements. Results also suggest that parent brand-extension fit, though an important determinant of an extension's assessment, plays a less critical role in a comparative evaluation context when an extension's brand strength is accounted for in relation to its competition in the target category. Therefore, the findings stress the importance of both competition and parent-brand fit in making informed positioning decisions and more realistic predictions of extension success. The research demonstrates when, how and to what extent comparative evaluations result in lower extension ratings and provides managerial strategies to introduce an extension effectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Power of Personal Connections in Micro-Influencer Marketing: A Study on Consumer Behaviour and the Impact of Micro-Influencers,Gerlich M.,2023,10.58262/tmj.v11i1.1010,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, influencer marketing has snowballed into a big phenomenon when businesses around the world are trying to use influencers to promote their products and services. However, even though influencer marketing is a craze in the market, the engagement rate and conversion rates of micro-influencers with a smaller size of followers are higher than that of celebrities and mega influencers. It is important to understand the reasons why certain influencers are successful and others are not. Past research mainly focuses on micro-influencers as one group but does not differentiate between micro-influencers who are known personally by their followers and those who are not personally known. This is important as consumers are sceptical towards the product promotion not only of mega-influencers because they believe that influencers, in general, are using their base of followers to promote a product or service for money and fame. Therefore, consumers trust the words and opinions of micro-influencers, who provide information based on their own experience and expertise. It is worth investigating the underlying reason for the success of these micro and nano influencers. Is it the personal connection with the follower? Is it the engagement rate and the choice of products and recommendations? These are some of the points that have been investigated in this research. The objective of this research paper was to explore if followers who share a relationship with or know the micro-influencers personally make their purchase decisions based on the recommendations provided by the influencers. The research findings highlighted that when micro-influencers are known to their followers on a personal level, they wield more persuasive power over their followers. © 2023 Oxbridge Publishing House Ltd UK",consumer behaviour; digital marketing; influencer marketing; marketing; micro-influencer; social media marketing,Transnational Press London Ltd,scopus-recommendation

But the influence process varies by type of influencer: Virtual influencers’ recommendations appear more useful, especially for utilitarian products, but consumers identify more with human influencers’ posts. Both usefulness and identification increase intention to adopt influencers’ recommendation.

Evaluating strategies for promoting retail mobile channel using a hidden Markov model,Chen J.; Rao V.R.,2023,10.1016/j.jretai.2022.07.001,"With the proliferation of mobile communication technology, many firms, including retailers and consumer banks, are making efforts to develop mobile platforms to better engage with their customers and reduce operational costs. However, the cost advantage of these mobile technologies will not yield fruition unless the mobile channel accounts for a significant share of total transactions. In this article, we explore potential options for firms to promote usage of the mobile channel. To achieve this, we propose a hidden Markov model to both model customers’ decisions and assess different managerial strategies through simulations. While we apply our proposed model to data from a leading financial institution, our approach is equally applicable to other retail settings. The results show that customers’ choices of services and channels are sensitive to process time by type of channel. A 10% increase in process time through non-mobile channels leads to a nearly 14% increase in utilization of mobile banking channel. Therefore, retailing firms could potentially influence customers’ choice of different channels by changing channel-specific process times. Motivated by these findings, we present and compare performances across five different policies, in promoting the usage of mobile channel. Drawing on our simulation results, we also make personalized policy recommendations to firms facing different levels of financial constraints. For those with financial constraints, we recommend a policy of increasing process time for a selected subset of service requests through non-mobile channels. Firms not constrained by the resources might be better off improving process time with the mobile channel by targeting customers identified as having a better relationship with the firm. © 2022 New York University",Customer relationship management; Digital marketing; Hidden Markov model; Mobile channel,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Understanding digitally enabled complex networks: a plural granulation based hybrid community detection approach,Gupta S.; Deodhar S.,2024,10.1108/ITP-10-2020-0682,"Purpose: Communities representing groups of agents with similar interests or functions are one of the essential features of complex networks. Finding communities in real-world networks is critical for analyzing complex systems in various areas ranging from collaborative information to political systems. Given the different characteristics of networks and the capability of community detection in handling a plethora of societal problems, community detection methods represent an emerging area of research. Contributing to this field, the authors propose a new community detection algorithm based on the hybridization of node and link granulation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed algorithm utilizes a rough set-theoretic concept called closure on networks. Initial sets are constructed by using neighborhood topology around the nodes as well as links and represented as two different categories of granules. Subsequently, the authors iteratively obtain the constrained closure of these sets. The authors use node mutuality and link mutuality as merging criteria for node and link granules, respectively, during the iterations. Finally, the constrained closure subsets of nodes and links are combined and refined using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and a local density function to obtain communities in a binary network. Findings: Extensive experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks followed by a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research limitations/implications: The study also contributes to the ongoing effort related to the application of soft computing techniques to model complex systems. The extant literature has integrated a rough set-theoretic approach with a fuzzy granular model (Kundu and Pal, 2015) and spectral clustering (Huang and Xiao, 2012) for node-centric community detection in complex networks. In contributing to this stream of work, the proposed algorithm leverages the unexplored synergy between rough set theory, node granulation and link granulation in the context of complex networks. Combined with experiments of network datasets from various domains, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal co-occurring disjoint, overlapping and nested communities without necessarily assigning each node to a community. Practical implications: This study carries important practical implications for complex adaptive systems in business and management sciences, in which entities are increasingly getting organized into communities (Jacucci et al., 2006). The proposed community detection method can be used for network-based fraud detection by enabling experts to understand the formation and development of fraudulent setups with an active exchange of information and resources between the firms (Van Vlasselaer et al., 2017). Products and services are getting connected and mapped in every walk of life due to the emergence of a variety of interconnected devices, social networks and software applications. Social implications: The proposed algorithm could be extended for community detection on customer trajectory patterns and design recommendation systems for online products and services (Ghose et al., 2019; Liu and Wang, 2017). In line with prior research, the proposed algorithm can aid companies in investigating the characteristics of implicit communities of bloggers or social media users for their services and products so as to identify peer influencers and conduct targeted marketing (Chau and Xu, 2012; De Matos et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). The proposed algorithm can be used to understand the behavior of each group and the appropriate communication strategy for that group. For instance, a group using a specific language or following a specific account might benefit more from a particular piece of content than another group. The proposed algorithm can thus help in exploring the factors defining communities and confronting many real-life challenges. Originality/value: This work is based on a theoretical argument that communities in networks are not only based on compatibility among nodes but also on the compatibility among links. Building up on the aforementioned argument, the authors propose a community detection method that considers the relationship among both the entities in a network (nodes and links) as opposed to traditional methods, which are predominantly based on relationships among nodes only. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cohesion; Community; Decision support; IT artifact; Network analysis; Social computing,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation

Recommender systems have become irreplaceable both for helping users navigate the increasing amounts of data and, conversely, aiding providers in marketing products to interested users. Data-driven models are susceptible to data bias, materializing in the bias influencing the models’ decision-making. For recommender systems, such issues are well exemplified by occupation recommendation, where biases in historical data may lead to recommender systems relating one gender to lower wages or to the propagation of stereotypes. In particular, consumer-side fairness, which focuses on mitigating discrimination experienced by users of recommender systems, has seen a vast number of diverse approaches. The approaches are further diversified through differing ideas on what constitutes fair and, conversely, discriminatory recommendations. This survey serves as a systematic overview and discussion of the current research on consumer-side fairness in recommender systems.

Extending beyond the previous perspective that consumers’ perceptions and behaviors are influenced by vloggers’ attributes, we herein investigate the influence of recommendation content. Drawing on the means-end chain framework, this paper investigates how the attributes of recommendation content affect consumers’ intention to adopt (i.e., follow) the recommendation. Data collected from 513 respondents provides support for the proposed influences. The results indicate that source credibility, content diagnosticity, and content serendipity drive consumers’ recommendation adoption intention. This research contributes to the literature on rec-vlog marketing by clarifying the significant role of recommendation content. Implications are discussed regarding these findings. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Helpful content attributes; Means-end chain framework; Recommendation adoption; Recommendation vlog; Social media marketing,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Gastronomic Curiosity and Consumer Behavior: The Impact of Television Culinary Programs on Choices of Food Services,Gajdzik B.; Jaciow M.; Wolniak R.; Wolny R.,2024,10.3390/foods13010115,"In highly developed countries, more and more people use culinary services. Cooking at home, for the family, is giving way to culinary services. Consumers either order food home or use the offers of restaurants and bars. Consumers’ choice of culinary form may be influenced by cooking television programs. Many TV stations broadcast cooking programs. This study examined the impact of television culinary programs on consumer behavior in the restaurant services market. The article examines the interplay of emotional responses, personality traits, and culinary preferences to understand how TV cooking programs influence dining decisions. The study was conducted using the CAWI method, which involved 742 respondents. The study, conducted between May 2021 and April 2022, was addressed to people who visited restaurants presented in the Polish culinary TV show titled “Kitchen Revolutions”. The study revealed that almost 3/4 of the respondents chose restaurants based on the program’s recommendations. Although there was a strong emotional connection with this program—nearly half of the respondents expressed delight in the taste of snacks and main courses—this did not always translate into an increased frequency of eating meals away from home. Only every third respondent said that the program influenced their gastronomic behavior. The research hypotheses examined the extent to which culinary TV shows influence the frequency of visits to restaurants, the perceived quality of life, and the influence on consumers with specific personality traits. The results partially supported the hypothesis that cooking programs on television encourage people to eat out more often, but the perceived impact on quality of life and on some personality traits was less clear. The article contributes to the understanding of consumer behavior in the food service market by highlighting the complex dynamics of emotional reactions, personality traits, and the impact of culinary television programs. The findings have practical implications for the restaurant industry, suggesting a focus on emotional impact, food quality and presentation, and targeting marketing strategies towards consumers who are open to new experiences and ready to experiment. © 2023 by the authors.",consumer behaviors; culinary programs; food choices; gastronomic consumer; television cooking,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-recommendation
Analyzing survey data in marketing research: A guide for academics and postgraduate students,Crick J.M.,2024,10.1080/0965254X.2023.2176533,"Numerous marketing scholars have been overly loyal to seminal (and out-dated) analytical processes when using surveys. If this continues, these individuals may receive rejection decisions, as the standards of the so-called publishing game have increased. Accordingly, from an Associate Editor perspective, this commentary provides a contemporary guide (with thirteen stages) on how survey data can be effectively analyzed. This covers a series of basic techniques (like treating missing values, presenting profiling information about samples, and undertaking descriptive statistical analyses), alongside describing some scale purification tools and several complex procedures (e.g., running tests for various forms of reliability and validity, addressing common method variance, and testing for endogeneity bias). Then, some conclusions and methodological recommendations are offered to help authors to advance theory and practice with robust survey data. It is anticipated that these discussion points will facilitate debates among readers of the Journal of Strategic Marketing (and beyond) about the analysis of survey data. © 2023 The Author(s).

Factors Contributing to Online or In-store Shopping among Academics from a Private Higher Education Institution in South Africa,Moodley M.; Naidoo S.,2023,10.32479/irmm.14732,"The aim of the study was to determine the factors contributing to online or in-store shopping behaviour among academics from a private higher education institution in South Africa. In addition, the study examined types of products or services consumers are likely to purchase in-store and online and particular aspects relating to store atmosphere, as well as the challenges that were experienced using both modes of shopping. The study was conducted at a private higher education institution. A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among all the academics in the organisation. The study show that the majority of respondents belonged to generation X and Y and that they are more inclined to purchase from both in-store and online stores rather than a singular mode of shopping. However, there is an element of fear, anxiety and uncertainty that customers face when purchasing online. This is motivated by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model. Factors that influence the overall purchasing decision for both online and in-store shopping include accessibility, convenience, delivery service, store aesthetics (atmosphere and ambience) and the availability of an assistant. Recommendations for retail marketing managers include the fact that they should consider a hybrid model of both in-store and online shopping. Moreover, invest in enhancing the store image of both physical stores as well as virtual online stores as the subtle atmospheric cues trigger impulse purchasing. © 2023, Econjournals.

Survey of screw-retained versus cement-retained implant restorations used in both education and private dental practices,Found A.A.; Shah S.; Fouda M.A.; Santos M.J.M.C.; Butler S.,2024,10.1002/jdd.13568,"Aims: In the literature, it is still unclear if the decisions for selecting the type of implant crown-retaining system are based on scientific-based research or if the Universities’ choices, Implant marketing trends, or finances could have a major influence on the private dentists’ decisions. Objectives: Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the crown-retaining system (cement- or screw-retained) used in dental schools and private dental practices. Methods: A 13-item questionnaire was sent to Canadian dental schools (n = 10) and dental offices in London (n = 298), Canada. The questionnaire included demographic questions and questions to reveal the dentists’ perspectives on prosthetic implant treatment between the two-retaining systems. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression (p = 0.05). Results: Twenty-four private dentists and five dental schools responded to the survey – 62.5% of private practitioners and 60% of universities reported using both systems. A trend was observed in using screw-retained systems by dentists who graduated 5–10 years ago. Straumann, Astra, and Nobel Biocare were the private practices and dental schools’ preferred implant systems. The use of platform switching for all cases was selected by 54.2% of the private practitioners and 40% of the dental schools. Resin cement was the private practice's preferred cementation method; the dental schools used glass ionomer and zinc phosphate cement. The multinomial logistic regressions showed no statistical difference between the crown-retaining system chosen and the decision factors. The laboratory technician's recommendations and cost influenced the decision-making process for private dentists. For the universities, perio-restorative outcome, implant position, survival rates, institute preferences, and evidence-based research influenced the crown-retaining system's decision-making process. Conclusion: The Canadian dental schools and private practice reported using both screw- and cement-retaining systems. However, there was a difference in the selection criteria as the universities showed a tendency towards a more research-based approach in their decision, while for the private practices, the technicians’ recommendations and cost played a major role in the decision process. It was noted that the implant systems preconized by the Universities were observed to be used in private practices. © 2024 The Authors.

What Is (and Isn’t) a Product Recall?,Astvansh V.; Antia K.D.; Tellis G.J.,2024,10.1177/07439156241242419,"Safety in consumer goods is maintained by product safety laws and associated regulations. However, the legislation and regulations are specific to product categories and legal jurisdictions, thus impeding one's ability to understand what a recall is and isn’t, and how it differs from related phenomena (e.g., product-harm crisis). The authors aim to provide such an understanding. They reviewed 510 reports from academics, managers, governments, and regulators; conducted interviews with 25 practitioners; and used 10 recall data sets to identify seven fundaments of recall. They synthesize the fundaments to propose a definition and a decision tree of recall, which can help inform academics, journalists, managers, lawyers, and safety advocates regarding what term is appropriate in what context. The authors apply the fundaments to identify similarities and differences between a recall and a harm crisis, the term used frequently in marketing research in association with recall. The fundaments also enable the authors to make five recommendations each for lawmakers and regulators in an effort to guide the academic and practitioner discourse on product recall. © American Marketing Association 2024.",conceptual; product recall; product-harm crisis; research agenda; review,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-recommendation
How do social media influencers inspire consumers' purchase decisions? The mediating role of parasocial relationships,Ashraf A.; Hameed I.; Saeed S.A.,2023,10.1111/ijcs.12917,"In recent years, social media influencers (SMIs) have become part of the strategic communication of firms because the traditional form of mass media communication is losing its effectiveness. Thus, it is imperative to study the effects of communication through SMIs on marketing outcomes, such as purchase intentions. Based on the fairness dimensions, that is, information, distributive, interpersonal, and procedural, and dimensions of source credibility, that is, attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, and similarity, this research investigated how technology-oriented SMIs (T-SMIs) foster parasocial relationships (PSRs) with followers. Purposive sampling was employed to collect data from 506 active social media users. Data were analysed through IBM AMOS and SPSS 26. The results of the study suggested that attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, similarity, interpersonal, procedural, and information fairness are positively related to fostering PSR with followers. In contrast, distributive fairness does not strengthen PSR with followers; furthermore, the study findings suggested an indirect positive influence of attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness, similarity, interpersonal, procedural, and information fairness on the purchase intentions of consumers via PSR. This study is useful for academia and industry since it fills important gaps in the literature and provides recommendations to brand managers of technology companies about selecting appropriate SMIs for the endorsement of their brands. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",fairness; parasocial relationships; purchase intention; social media influencers; source credibility,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-recommendation
Market amplification or transformation? The role of industry analysts in spreading WOM in B2B,Cowan K.; Palo T.; Chapple D.; Zhang Y.,2023,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0127,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address these questions. Word-of-mouth (WOM) is increasingly important in business-to-business (B2B) decision-making. Yet, research on this topic is rather limited, and often borrows from business-to-consumer (B2C) WOM literature. The question remains as to whether these assumptions realistically occur in B2B WOM. Specifically, this study explores the following questions: What value does B2B WOM have? Why do social media influencers in B2B engage in WOM? What type(s) of social media influencers spread WOM in B2B? Design/methodology/approach: To address these questions, this study adopts a qualitative research strategy. This study focuses on industry analysts in information technology markets who often influence the buying decisions of customers through their expertise and recommendations of technology solutions. Based on interviews with these influencers, this study explicates B2B WOM, an area the authors know much less of in comparison to B2C WOM. Findings: This study reveals differences in who spreads WOM within B2B, their roles, key features of their content and how they spread WOM. Second, this study demonstrates the types of actors spreading WOM in B2B in relation to the type of WOM and how it actually influences B2B markets. Originality/value: This study broadens the current definition of WOM and, specifically, showcases WOM not only as amplifying messages but as a means to co-create the market itself with vendors and clients. This research offers several contributions to the B2B WOM literature and influencer practice. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business-to-business; Influencer marketing; Market creation; Opinion leadership; Social media influencer; Thought leadership; Word-of-mouth,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
Intersectionality and urban mobility: A systematic review on gender differences in active transport uptake,Yuan Y.; Masud M.; Chan H.; Chan W.; Brubacher J.R.,2023,10.1016/j.jth.2023.101572,"Background: Active transport has numerous environmental and health benefits. However, these benefits are not evenly distributed across the population because its utilization is strongly linked to a person's socioeconomic and cultural factors. Through the lens of intersectionality, this systematic review analyzed how gender and its interactions with other socioeconomic and cultural factors influence a person's decision to utilize active transport in urban settings. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the authors screened 1,993 titles and abstracts that were published between January 2000 and December 2021. Twenty-one articles were included for data extraction and synthesis. Results: A person's decision to walk or cycle is highly contextual. In general, women with lower socioeconomic status tend to walk more out of necessity. Women with higher socioeconomic status, higher education level, more free time, and access to safe and convenient infrastructure tend to cycle more. Gendered social and cultural factors might also deter some women from active transport. The following recommendations may attract more people to walk or cycle for transportation: developing community-based programs that empower girls and women to cycle; building a safe environment that protects all vulnerable road users; creating media and social marketing campaigns that shift the cultural narratives around active transport; designing neighourhoods with higher mixed land usage; and advocating for gender and income equality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Active transportation; Gender; Intersectionality; Socioeconomic status,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Thought experiments: Review and recommendations,Aguinis H.; Beltran J.R.; Archibold E.E.; Jean E.L.; Rice D.B.,2023,10.1002/job.2658,"Thought experiments have been used as an effective methodological approach to advance theory in numerous scientific fields. However, they are underutilized in organizational behavior (OB) and adjacent fields. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive and multidisciplinary literature review of thought experiments that entailed 174 sources in economics, psychology, marketing, medicine, sociology, finance, and other fields. We used insights from this literature review to define and describe the unique nature of thought experiments and offer a taxonomy of four main types based on a theory's development stage (i.e., early vs. late) and a study's theoretical goal (i.e., confirmation vs. disconfirmation). We also provide a decision-making tree useful for evaluating whether conducting a thought experiment is beneficial for a particular research situation and which of the four types is most likely to produce a meaningful contribution. Then, we offer best-practice recommendations for conducting thought experiments that address how to plan, execute, report results, and discuss implications. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of thought experiments by using the best-practice recommendations to design and conduct a thought experiment in the domain of workplace allyship. Finally, we offer suggestions for future substantive research that would benefit from thought experiment methodology (i.e., diversity, equity, and inclusion; leadership; performance; selection and recruitment; teams; and turnover). Overall, our article offers a comprehensive review and recommendations that we hope will be a catalyst for using thought experiments to advance theory in OB and related fields. © 2022 The Authors.

Appraisal of mixed-use developments through multiple criteria decision making: insights from Shanghai’s megacity context,Valero A.,2024,10.1080/23311975.2024.2332500,"This paper investigates the selection criteria and success factors of retailers within mixed-use developments in Shanghai, from the 2009 financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic. By using Multiple Criteria Decision Making focused on three groups of key performance indicators: External, specifics of the Industry, and Users, the study aims to provide a comprehensive review of retail location selection within the emerging paradigm of mixed-use environments. The assessment reveals that connectivity, specifically with metro stations within 500 m, is paramount to a project’s success. Moreover, 73% of the projects surveyed feature more than two underground levels, with the top 10 ranking projects boasting 3–4 floors above ground, occupied by both offices and retail spaces. Structurally, almost 90% of the mixed-use developments being studied have commercial areas exceeding 35,000 sqm. The optimal project size is determined to be around 200,000 sqm, with retail making up half of the built area. The preferred land plot size ranges from 35,000 to 40,000 sqm. However, the study also identifies a lack of comprehensive sustainability strategies and net-zero carbon certifications in many of these developments. The findings also contribute to urban researchers and policymakers by offering a multi-criteria matrix to assess and scale mixed-use developments, not only in Shanghai but also in other geographical locations.

To achieve our goal, we offered 405 participants an experimental VR experience with digital content about a wine tourism activity. The results showed that participants feel that the VR experience influences their behavioural intention towards the wine tourism destination. The satisfaction felt from the experience leads to a significant effect on the intention to visit and to recommend the destination and the VR activity.

Courses: This project was conducted in a stand-alone course titled “Intro to Media Analytics.” However, this project would work well in any media analytics, social media analytics, or social/digital marketing course. This assignment could be adapted slightly to meet the needs of a public or strategic communications course where the focus on a public relations plan is needed. A student-run public relations agency could use this assignment to apply to client work related to increasing web and social media traffic. Objectives: With this assignment, students (1) apply appropriate methods for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting media analytics data for understanding and engaging audiences; (2) engage in research and analysis to provide insights, problem-solving strategies, and decisions in strategic planning for a client; (3) gain a basic understanding of factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, and theories in producing media content and for visualizing data derived through media analytics to clarify and present complex results; (4) evaluate the impact of business structure, competition, and positioning for accessing media usage in various media platforms, including social and mobile media; and (5) write clearly and effectively for reports that guide recommendations for a real-world client in order to develop competencies and points of view needed by professionals in the field most closely related to this course. © 2023 National Communication Association.",,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Digital Marketing Implementation by Culinary Micro Small Medium Enterprises During Covid-19 (An Indonesia Case),Martadikusumah T.A.A.; Indrawati,2024,10.47750/QAS/25.198.25,"This study aims to understand the culinary cluster MSMEs' efforts in Cimahi City to implement digital marketing during Covid-19. The research includes factors that hinder the decision to use digital platforms based on the TOE Framework, digital marketing activities, business performance, digital marketing constraints, and recommendations for stakeholders in optimizing digital marketing. The methodology of this research is qualitative, with a case study strategy. This study obtained the data through online in-depth interviews and FGDs with 10 Culinary MSMEs owners and four representatives of the Cimahi City government. The results showed that informants adopted digital platforms, but employee skills indicators inhibit decision-making. The implementation of digital marketing and business performance could have been more optimal. Therefore, the main barrier to digital marketing activities is the limited capacity, capability, and number of HR in the organization that can market digitally. Hence, the proposed recommendations are improving digital literacy and stakeholder collaboration through training, mentoring, and labor assistance. © 2024, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

The dissemination and impacts of deceptive eWOM: a dynamic process perspective,Shih C.-F.; Huang S.-L.; Huang H.-C.,2023,10.1080/0144929X.2022.2063759,"To minimise risk, consumers seek out eWOM, recommendations, and reviews from others before making purchasing decisions. However, it is not uncommon to see companies masterminding deceptive eWOM, disguising promotional messages as user-generated product reviews to attract and retain consumers. The extant literature is extremely limited regarding deceptive eWOM and its long-term effects. Ours is the first longitudinal study to examine consumers’ belief and attitude changes in the context of deceptive eWOM. This study found that, in a herding situation, deceptive eWOM can strongly influence changes in consumers’ beliefs and attitudes, whether in the early phase or mainstream phase, at the pre-adoption stage. If deceptive eWOM emerges earlier, it has a more powerful influence later. At the post-adoption stage, once they have used it, consumers may change their evaluations of a new product. However, this new evaluation is still subject to the initial anchoring effect brought by deceptive eWOM. If consumers sense deceptive eWOM and attribute it to a certain responsible party, the anchoring effect will be weakened. These findings provide further knowledge and understanding of the effects of deceptive eWOM, with implications for firms seeking to develop more effective eWOM marketing strategies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",And phrases: deceptive eWOM; fake review; herd behaviour; information cascade; longitudinal study,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

The changing roles of mass media amidst the growth of the digital media,Hongcharu B.,2024,10.1080/23311886.2023.2297721,"Mass media have been a significant element in society. However, as people have more access to information and communication technology, they spend more time on digital media than on mass media. Thus, we explore this issue along with the factors and implications that this trend might bring about. This is the first study to conduct an in-depth comparative analysis along with literature review to understand this major change in media consumption. The paper first analyzes the characteristics and the communication process of mass and digital media. Then, we compare mass media and digital media’s usage, the numbers of Internet and digital media’ users in the United States along with global social media users. We discover the usage per day for digital media has increased while that for mass media declined. We explore the reasons behind this change and identify factors affecting the marketers’ decisions to change the ways they spend marketing communications’ budget on both types of media. We are also interested in the roles of mass media in the era when digital media gain more popularity. Implications and recommendations for marketers to cope with this major change are discussed including the impact on target market selection, marketing communications budget planning, functions of the media, behavioral transactions of both types of media, new supporting roles of the mass media and the roles of both types of media in supporting integrated marketing communications’ campaigns. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems, a global and comparative overview of the tax systems designs and rates, legislative framework, Big Tobacco’s marketing strategies, and case studies",Tanca C.; Carrington D.; Dauchy E.; Skipalskyi A.; Bakhturidze G.,2023,10.18332/TPC/172623,"Introduction Electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems (ENDS/ ENNDS) are attracting new nicotine users, particularly nonsmokers, and youth. Although the long-term health effects are uncertain, ENDS contain nicotine—a highly addictive product, and most of the existing evidence on ENDS/ENNDS shows that they are not without risks. Moreover, youth and non-smokers using e-cigarettes are more likely to initiate conventional cigarettes and start at earlier ages. Furthermore, ENDS are not very effective as cessation aids and are often used in combination with conventional tobacco products. The taxation of ENDS/ENNDS remains a challenge for most governments, especially in light is the tradeoff between, on the one hand, the potential that smokers would use ENDS to quit conventional cigarettes successfully and, on the other hand, the new health risks that these products pose and the uptake of use by young people and non-smokers. Objective About ENDS/ENNDS, this session will examine, globally and comparatively, three key areas critical for advocacy: taxation, legal (non-tax and price) frameworks, and communications used by manufacturers and vendors. Material and Methods First, it will present and evaluate the tax systems used currently in countries that manufacture or sell ENDS/ENNDS and compare these systems based on their tax burdens and designs. Second, it examines the various legal (non-tax and price) frameworks used in these countries and compares them with conventional cigarettes. Third, it will present the media used by manufacturers and vendors of ENDS/ENNDS, the messages, and the audience they use to promote them. Finally, the session will present and compare case studies to provide concrete examples. Results There is a significant variation in the types of tax systems used for ENDS/ENNDS, and most countries impose very low tax rates on these products compared to cigarettes. As WHO has concluded, e-cigarettes are “harmful” and countries that have not banned e-cigarettes should ensure that “their tobacco control laws and regulations are comprehensive enough to regulate all forms of novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products.” E-cigarette manufacturers, including the major tobacco companies, are spending millions of dollars on lobbying decision-makers in countries around the world to seek favorable e-cigarette regulation. Further, the industry targets non-smokers and young people through product design, nicotine delivery, flavorings, and by marketing on social media. Conclusions Encourage countries to follow WHO recommendations and impose high taxation for ENDS/ENNDS and regulations that match those of conventional cigarettes. © (2023), (European Publishing).

Applying the triple coherence line to in-store marketing plans to increase private label market share,Garrido-Morgado Á.; González-Benito Ó.,2024,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103642,"Difficult economic times might encourage private label purchases, though most such decisions occur in-store. The current study therefore presents an analysis of whether in-store displays (ISD) exert similar effects on private labels versus national brands, which ISD are most effective, and how retailers can maximize their effects. With a triple coherence line (TCL) framework, the authors determine ISD that favor a decision process in which the consumer can easily recognize the benefits of a promotion, increase their impact on sales, especially if the product itself offers similar benefits. They establish a novel, unique data set of scanner and observational data about daily product prices and sales in 22 categories, according to the uses of different ISD (shelf signage, end-of-aisle, islands) and promotions (price, product). The results confirm their different effects on private labels versus national brands; when ISD facilitate decision processes that are congruent with private-label purchase motivations, they exert greater effects on sales, and these effects can be maximized by applying the TCL framework. In detail, shelf signage that stimulates more cognitive and rational purchase decisions exerts powerful effects on private label purchases, which get reinforced by price promotions. These insights extend previous studies of in-store marketing actions and purchase decisions, leading to some useful recommendations for retailers. © 2023 The Authors",In-store display; National brand; Private label; Triple coherence line,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation

RATIONALIZING FICTION CUES: PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DISCLOSING ADS AND THE INACCURACY OF THE HUMAN MIND WHEN BEING IN PARASOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS,Degen J.L.,2023,10.28945/5108,"Aim/Purpose Parasocial relationships are today established on social media between influenc-ers and their followers. While marketing effects are well-researched, little is known about the meaning of such relationships and the psychological mecha-nisms behind them. This study, therefore, explores the questions: “How do fol-lowers on Instagram interpret explicit fiction cues from influencers?” and “What does this reveal about the meaning of parasocial attachment?” Background With a billion-dollar advertising industry and leading in influencing opinion, In-stagram is a significant societal and economic player. One factor for the effec-tive influence of consumers is the relationship between influencer and follower. Research shows that disclosing advertisements surprisingly does not harm credi-bility, and sometimes even leads to greater trustworthiness and, in turn, willing-ness to purchase. While such reverse dynamics are measurable, the mechanisms behind them remain largely unexplored. Methodology The study follows an explorative approach with in-depth interviews, which are analyzed with Mayring’s content analysis under a reconstructive paradigm. The findings are discussed through the lens of critical psychology. Contribution Firstly, this study contributes to the understanding of the communicative dy-namics of influencer-follower communication alongside the reality-fiction-gap model, and, secondly, it contributes empirical insights through the analysis of 22 explorative interviews. Findings The findings show (a) how followers rationalize fiction cues and justify compul-sive decision-making, (b) how followers are vulnerable to influences, and (c) how parasocial attachment formation overshadows rational logic and agency.Rationalizing Fiction Cues 86 The findings are discussed with regard to mechanisms, vulnerabilities, rationali-zations and cognitive bias, and the social self, as well as the ethics of influencer marketing and politics. Recommendations for Practitioners The paper has relevance for professionals working with children, the youth, and adults, in understanding their relationships and their meaning both on the indi-vidual and societal level. Such improve insights and adequate measures in peda-gogy, education, health, and therapy. Furthermore, critical perspectives on par-asociallity and its mechanisms can contribute to ethical policymaking. Recommendations for Researchers The contribution is relevant to relationship research, group dynamics and socie-tal organizing, well-being, identity, and health perspectives, within psychology, sociology, media studies, and pedagogy to management. Impact on Society This paper contributes to comprehending nowadays relationships and processes of identification through a systemic lens and develops a critical reflection on current conditions in life. Future Research Future research might seek to understand more about (a) quantifiable vulnera-bilities, such as attachment styles, dispositions, and demographics, (b) usage pat-terns and possible factors of prevention, (c) cognitive and emotional mecha-nisms involved with larger samples, (d) the impact on relationships and well-be-ing, and (e) possible conditions for the potential of parasocial attachment. © 2023, Informing Science.

This social-savvy netizen uses social networks extensively to engage with socially connected people, but also actively interacts with online retailers and brands through social networks. This suggests that generation Z consumers seamlessly involve their connected social community to obtain reviews and recommendations, and then use this information to guide their purchasing decisions. This study argued that desire is the leading predictor influence online social shopping purchase intention. We applied the Model of Goal-directed behaviour to examine the influence of social desire and commercial desire on online social shopping purchase intention. At the same time, it attempts to examine whether social desire and commercial desire play a mediator role. This study, which is confined to Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, focuses on generation Z consumers aged 17 to 26 years old. A total of 288 samples were collected using the purposive sampling technique and analysed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings revealed that social attitude influences social desire and commercial attitude influenced commercial desire. Lastly, online social shopping purchase intention was influenced by both social desire and commercial desire. It indicates that both social desire and commercial desire play a mediating role.

Consumer self-construal modulates the relevance of E-tail socialness,Aljukhadar M.; Senecal S.,2023,10.1108/BJM-10-2022-0397,"Purpose: The growth in social content such as video facilitates consumer exposure to social information at e-tail settings. Research has recommended enhancing the e-store socialness. Focusing on focal consumer outcomes (flow and purchase intentions), the current research delineates a boundary condition, proposing that e-tail socialness improves outcomes when the consumer interdependent self, rather than the independent self, is activated. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental approach is employed to test the research thesis. Two experiments (N1 = 303 Females 42.4%; N2 = 387 Females 51.4%) that used different manipulation for socialness and sample frames (USA and Canadian) are performed. Analysis of variance was applied. Findings: The results generally support the research thesis, suggesting that e-tail socialness enhances consumer flow and purchase intentions when the interdependent self is activated. The effect, however, is marginal for segments with high brand preference. Practical implications: As more information increase overload and reduce decision quality, e-tail practitioners should focus on providing social information predominately for consumers whose interdependent self is activated. This recommendation is particularly relevant for segments with low brand preference. Originality/value: So far, studies recommend enhancing the e-store socialness, or increasing the social volume, to achieve better outcomes. Such research stream is giving rise to the “social is better in e-tail” conventional wisdom. The current work contributes by delineating a boundary condition based on consumer self-construal.

In analyzing data, the modified Van Kaam approach was used, utilizing a seven-step framework that considers the structural and textual aspects of experiences, as well as the perceptual characteristics of the phenomenon. FINDINGS: The themes answered the key research question of the study: What are the critical factors that are impacting on failures of tech start-ups in Sri Lanka? The cause of tech start-up failures according to the current study varied including, financial uncertainty, no market research, no product–market fit, paranoid behaviors of innovators, lack of timely response to changing conditions, and location of the venture. IMPLICATIONS: The paper concisely presents twelve critical reasons for tech start-up failures. The results of the research will enable Sri Lankan tech start-ups to identify key factors of failure for the growth of their surviving strategies. Identifying secret obstacles in the industry helps entrepreneurs prepare for pitfalls and provides guidelines for policymakers to make informed choices when implementing national policies. More importantly, it has been discovered that the major areas that require more attention are leadership, funding, marketing, and innovation. Finally, four groups of recommendations have been discussed under financing, market research, leadership, and inventors. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The comparison of the current study themes with the findings of related studies is inconclusive because the literature on tech start-up failures in other countries and in Sri Lanka is minimal. Some of the themes align with the findings of research conducted in other countries, although there were some themes that were explored uniquely. © 2023, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

"IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL MARKETING ON OVERALL SME PERFORMANCE IN MANICALAND PROVINCE, ZIMBABWE",Mutanho D.; Shumba T.,2024,,"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeline for economic growth in both developed and emerging markets; however, they continue to face growth challenges. Theoretically, SMEs are major contributors to employment creation, wealth generation and poverty alleviation. Literature shows that SME sustainability is affected by a variety of variables, including reputation. The article seeks to analyse the relationship between SME entrepreneurial marketing, described as customer intensity and proactiveness, and overall performance, associated with consumer reputation, in emerging markets. Three hypotheses were generated from literature review, and they were tested through empirical data collected from Manicaland Province SMEs. The hypotheses relate to the linkages between entrepreneurial marketing and overall SME performance. A total of 190 entrepreneurs operating SMEs in Manicaland Province were surveyed. Through convenience sampling, entrepreneurs who employ a minimum of five people were selected from all the districts of Manicaland Province. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the three hypotheses. The article finds that two dimensions of entrepreneurial marketing impact on overall SME performance. Three strategic recommendations arise from this article that may improve the impact of entrepreneurship marketing on the performance of SMEs, and they are detailed under the last section. Together, the three strategic recommendations imply that SMEs marketing has to rely on research in order to: gain understanding of determinants and outcomes of international entrepreneurship and innovation; analyse possible matrices of strategic approaches to international entrepreneurship management in decision-making; and exploit the potential for using corporate social behaviour as a niche for gaining competitive advantage for sustainable development. © Journal of Global Business and Technology.",Emerging Markets; Entrepreneurship; Marketing; Small and Medium Enterprises; Zimbabwe,"Global Business and Technology Association, Inc.",scopus-recommendation
The impact of influencers' multi-SNS use on followers’ behavioral intentions: An integration of cue consistency theory and social identity theory,Hsieh J.-K.,2023,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103397,"The considerable marketing potential brought by the rapid growth of social media has been extensively examined in the literature, particularly in terms of the impact of influencers' recommendations on their followers' decisions. However, little attention has been given to how the individual influencers' use of multiple social networking sites affects their followers' behavioral intentions. Hence, this academic gap warrants further exploration. Drawing on cue consistency theory, social identity theory, and stimulus-organism-response framework, this research proposes three research questions and constructs an integrated research model to explore how the influencers' cue consistency affects the social identification of their followers, subsequently influencing their behavioral intentions. A structural equation modeling technique is performed to analyze the data of 510 valid respondents. The findings show that influencers' consistent cues (i.e., information and image consistency) across social media have positive impacts on followers' cognitive and affective identification toward the influencers. Furthermore, the determinants for followers' purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth intention are affirmed to serve as both cognitive and affective identification. Especially, the results indicate that the relationships between followers’ social identifications and behavioral intentions are moderated by the type of influencer (i.e., lifestyle vs. review). Accordingly, the results indicate how the use of multiple social networking sites by influencers impacts the behavioral intentions of their followers. The findings offer new insights into influencer marketing and provide important lessons for marketers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Cue consistency theory; Influencer marketing; Multi-SNS usage; Social identity theory; Social networking site (SNS); Stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
"Opportunities, challenges and implications of medical tourism development in Hong Kong",Zhong X.; Chan C.-S.,2024,10.1002/jtr.2615,"This study revealed two different sets of push and pull factors affecting the medical travel decision process of two groups of mainland Chinese to Hong Kong, including potential and experienced medical tourists. The relations between identified factors and their willingness of personal visit and recommendation were also investigated. Regarding the recommendation intention, interpersonal acquisition and personal needs satisfaction are mostly considered by travelers in psychological level while recognized high medical reception capacity and quality are also prioritized in the pull aspect. However, local medical service constraints, perceived quality of medical experience shaped by healthcare suppliers, and destination attributes determine the two groups' responses to personal visit intention. Besides, the advantages of developing medical tourism in Hong Kong are implicated as can-be-perceived unique cultural attribute, mass tourism fame as medical tourism development basis, and reputation for high-quality care formed with unintentional or deliberate promotion from third parties and various marketing channels. © 2024 The Authors.

A Dual Process Model of the Influence of Recommender Systems on Purchase Intentions in Online Shopping Environments,Xu L.; Roy A.; Niculescu M.,2023,10.1080/15332861.2022.2049113,"Whereas much research has looked at how recommendation systems influence online purchase intentions, this article illustrates the dual process model by which they occur. Using two studies, we fill the research void in interactive marketing by demonstrating how the dual processes of social proof and risk avoidance mediate the impact of recommendation labels on consumer decision-making contingent upon their level of involvement. Study 1 (n = 73), used a mixed-subjects design with a college student sample to demonstrate that both types of recommendation labels will lead to higher purchase intentions in an online setting. Most importantly, it provides evidence for the main effect of our theoretical model across different product categories. Study 2 (n = 160) provides support for our remaining four hypotheses by demonstrating the underlying process through which recommendation labels have a two-fold effect on purchase intentions. Specifically, the recommendation label increased the risk avoidance effect for high-involvement consumers and enhanced the social proof effect for low-involvement consumers. In both cases, the recommendation labels increased purchase intentions. Implications of our findings for theoretical and practical contributions and future directions are also explored. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Low and high involvement; online purchase intention; recommendation label; risk avoidance; social proof,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Joint market participation choices of smallholder farmers and households’ welfare: evidence from Senegal,Camara A.; Goundan A.; Henning C.; Savard L.; Beye A.,2023,10.1108/JADEE-08-2021-0201,"Purpose: There is much evidence in the literature showing the benefits of input market participation on farmers’ welfare. The same is true for participation in marketing. However, there are very few studies on the expected benefit of input market participation and marketing. This study fills this gap by examining the issue in the Senegalese context for food and cash crops. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression using a highly detailed 2017 agricultural survey in Senegal. They first identify factors that shape farmers’ decision to participate in the input market and marketing and then assess the impact of market participation choices on farmers’ profits. Findings: The results show that the most profitable market participation regime depends on the crop under consideration. For food crops, joint participation in markets maximizes profit per hectare, while for groundnuts, the main cash crop in Senegal, participation in the input market is not necessary to maximize farm profit. Research limitations/implications: Using panel data would improve the quality of estimations (time-variant effects) and help to consider the role of risk in output and input markets. Originality/value: This paper helps to characterize different profiles of farmers based on their market participation and crop choices and provide policymakers with recommendations for maximizing farmers’ profit. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agricultural market participation; Farm household model; Multinomial endogenous switching regression,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
The Influence of Internet Celebrities on Consumers' Purchase Intention and Its Educational Significance,Hu J.; Bin Sidek S.; Rahman A.A.; Yusof R.N.R.; Chen Y.,2023,,"University students in China are increasingly embracing the use of celebrity endorsement in teaching. Celebrities are now able to rapidly and easily reach a huge audience because of the growth of social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin, which makes them an appealing marketing tool for educational institutions. The potential advantages of leveraging celebrity endorsements to advertise their programs and draw students have been acknowledged by educational institutions in China. In addition to examining educational celebrity endorsement and educational purchase intention attainment, the study examines students' desire to act as moderators and planned behavior theory in Chinese universities. 440 students from various Chinese universities participated in an online and in-person survey that collected the data for the analysis. According to the findings of structural equation modeling (SEM), teaching strategies have a positive impact on students' desires. The study's results also showed a connection between achieving educational purchase intentions and celebrity endorsement of educational products, student consumer choice, and student desire. Cross-sectional analysis, close-ended questions, and quantitative research are all used in the current study. In light of this, it is deemed crucial to use creative and engaging teaching strategies in the higher education sector. Educational institutions can create marketing plans that boost students' purchasing intentions and enrollment levels by focusing on attitudes, arbitrary standards, and perceived behavioral control. To demonstrate the relationships between the constructs under consideration, future research on this topic should involve longitudinal or field testing. There are major policy recommendations, calls for future research, and recommended theoretical and practical implications. © 2023, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

A social identity theory perspective on sustainable brand recommendation: The case of professional service providers,Stoica M.; Hickman T.M.,2023,,"The purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, the paper calls attention to a unique subset of professional service providers (PSPs) who have obvious product expertise related to their profession yet are only minimally involved in the sales process. Despite this, they are considerably influential in regard to their clients’ brand decision-making process. Examples of these include veterinarians recommending a given pet food brand and dentists recommending a brand of dental floss. Secondly, since environmental sustainability is an important facet of corporate social responsibility, we considered factors that help predict PSPs’ propensity to recommend environmentally friendly brands to their clientele.The conceptual model argues that PSPs’ degree of identification with their profession, self-assessed knowledge in environmental concerns and expectation that sustainable brands will engage in eco-based marketing are all positive influences on PSPs’ likelihood to recommend sustainable brands and generate positive word of mouth. Responses from 467 veterinarians, representing this unique class of PSPs were analysed, and structural equation modelling determined that identification with the profession was a motivating factor in learning more about sustainability. In turn, self-assessed expertise in environmental issues was shown to increase the likelihood that PSPs would recommend sustainable brands. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.",brand recommendation; corporate social responsibility; professional service provider; social identity theory; sustainability; word of mouth,Henry Stewart Publications,scopus-recommendation
I'll have what she's having: (Social) Perceptions of default options and implications for marketing and decision making,Buchanan T.M.; Buchanan J.; Diedericks D.; Davis L.,2023,10.1111/ijcs.12847,"The power that default options have in shaping choice has been well established, yet relatively little is known about how decision makers experience and interpret such preselected options. Research suggests that individuals assume defaults represent a recommended course of action, yet the basis for this recommendation is unclear. Across two experimental studies, we explored consumer theories of default recommendations, examining spontaneous and experimentally manipulated perceptions of the basis of the default, and the impact on decision making across different contexts. Evidence across diverse populations and tasks shows that options were retained to a greater extent when represented as the default, consistent with classic default effects. Furthermore, a significant default effect emerged when the decision context was framed as complex. In line with research on social influence, defaults were most effective when they were presumed to reflect the most popular option (regardless of context). Interestingly, participants rated defaults as being more likely to represent the most popular option, regardless of decision context or default explanation provided to them. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the contexts in which default choices are relied upon and how those defaults are perceived by decision makers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",decision making; default; nudge; perceptions; social psychology,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-recommendation

Antecedents of intention to use electronic auctions in Jordan: Empirical study on the mediating role of users' attitudes,Almajali M.R.; Almajali D.; Majali T.; Masa’deh R.; Al-Okaily M.,2023,10.5267/j.ijdns.2023.7.024,"The present study attempted to determine the elements affecting users' opinions about using electronic auctions in Jordan. The study's target audience was Jordanian university students. We ran-domly selected 600 students from three public universities in Jordan after 600 users from each of the three universities responded to the surveys. The primary data for this study were gathered using a specially created questionnaire that was based on earlier research. SEM software (smart PLS 4.0.8.3) was employed in the evaluation of data. This study looked into the factors that led Jordanians to use electronic auctions and found four indirect significant relationships and ten direct significant relationships. First, user attitudes and independent variables (usefulness, aware-ness, ease of use, and techno trust) are directly significant antecedents of utilizing e-auctions in Jordan. The use of e-auctions is related to the independent variable in five direct and significant ways: usefulness, awareness, ease of use, digital divide, and techno trust. Thirdly, there are direct and statistically significant correlations between user attitudes and the independent variables (use-fulness, awareness, ease of use, and techno trust). Fourthly, there appears to be a clear and significant link between user attitudes and the intention to use e-auctions. Fifth, there are four mediated meaningful indirect correlations between the intention to use e-auctions and the independent var-iable. The findings of the current study are based on a number of factors that affect the demand for e-commerce in Jordan. They also include some recommendations for academics and decision-makers in e-marketing affairs. The current study also contributes in identifying challenges and suggestions that would overcome obstacles related to shopping operations through e-auctions. The factors examined in this study have been the subject of prior research. The data gathered in this study are valuable to Jordanian decision-makers and web developers, as the data can be used to create efficient policies and strategies to launch work on electronic auction platforms. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",Awareness; Digital divide; Perceived Ease of Use; Perceived usefulness; User Attitude,Growing Science,scopus-recommendation
Who are voice users? The contributions of decision-making conflict theory,Berriche A.; Benavent C.; Constantinides E.,2022,10.1108/JCM-04-2021-4584,"Purpose: This paper aims to categorize users of voice assistants and analyze decision-making conflicts to predict intention to adopt voice commerce (v-commerce). Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study used expert survey-based data collection founded on data saturation. Findings: This study identifies three forms of voice systems based on senses aroused (screen first, voice only and voice first) and four profiles of voice users (passive resistant, hedonistic adopter, utilitarian adopter and active resistant), each with a different appraisal of the benefits and costs of v-commerce adoption and the experiences (positive or negative) felt during the shopping experience. This study proposes a conceptual model to predict intention to adopt v-commerce depending on voice-system and -user characteristics. Practical implications: Learning from this study can help improve the marketing strategies and actions put in place by voice-assistant brands and advertisers by providing insights for adapting product recommendation algorithms to meet the needs of the identified profiles.

This study aims to diagnose the value chain for jumbo squid in Mexico using the structural analysis approach, allowing a description of the main actors, and their interactions with the markets, socioeconomic drivers, as well as the influence of different variables in the performance of jumbo squid chain value. The results derived from the structural analysis, six variables (related to the transformation, marketing, and consumption activities) and two actors (producers and academic research) were identified as the most relevant. The competitive advantages and added value could be reached by integrating the aspects related to the most relevant variables and taking appropriate decisions to deal with situations of uncertainty, which can promote weak nodes in the value chain, primarily because of the failures in the commercialization and consumption of jumbo squid. This suggests that efforts should not be concentrated on a single node but should be addressed jointly. Considering that the jumbo squid value chain currently depends on the changing conditions of the fishery, which is marked by production instability, causing uncertainty in the subsequent nodes; the status indicates that a restructuring of the value chain is evident since the market is prone to dismantling or self-regulation over the medium term. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","MACTOR method; Matrix of Alliances and Conflicts, Tactics, Objectives and Recommendations; Matrix of Cross Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification; MICMAC method; MORPHOL method; Structural analysis",Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Influence of memorable tourism experience on attitude towards pilgrimage: a moderated-mediation model with memorable religious experience and religiosity,Bhandari H.; Mittal A.; Arora M.,2024,10.1108/JHTI-11-2023-0848,"Purpose: The study investigates the mediated moderation impact of Memorable Religious Experience (MRE) and Religiosity (REL) on the relationship between Memorable Tourism Experience (MTE) and Attitude towards Pilgrimage (ATT) finally driving Recommend Intention (RCI) of visitors to a religious site. It suggests visitors' incentive variable religiosity can influence their decision to recommend visiting a religious destination. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a quantitative cross-sectional approach wherein a self-administered survey was used for data collection from 223 pilgrims who visited a popular pilgrimage site. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed for analysis. Findings: The results showed that MTE has a significant influence on ATT which further influences RCI (a dimension of behavioral intention-BI) of visitors towards a religious destination. Further, MRE mediates the relationship between MTE and ATT. Nevertheless, REL illustrated a significant moderation influence on the relationship between MRE and ATT, further verifying the mediated moderation impact of MRE and REL in the model. Practical implications: Recommendation of existing customers is one of the most powerful indicators of customer loyalty and usually leads to revisit. The research provides destination managers/tourism planners of pilgrimage sites to formulate appropriate marketing strategies to develop RCI and sustainable branding. Originality/value: This study adds to the empirical studies conducted on REL by constructing a composite picture of the memorable tourism experience within a pilgrimage tourism context. The uniqueness lies in the attempt to investigate the mediated moderation impact of MRE and REL using a symmetric (PLS-SEM) approach. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Memorable religious experience; Memorable tourism experience; Pilgrimage; PLS-SEM; Recommend intention; Religiosity,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation

This study analyzed how exposure to influencer content impacts key outcomes for the destination Jordan. A survey of tourists who visited Jordan in the past 3 years measured their perceptions of influencer credibility, content quality, awareness/interest, trust/engagement, destination image, general tourism behavior, and intentions to revisit. Results of SEM analysis found significant positive effects of influencer marketing on both destination image and visit intentions. Awareness/interest and trust/engagement were most impactful, highlighting influencers' role in sparking early motivation. Content quality additionally predicted visit intentions by informing decisions. Perceived credibility made recommendations more persuasive. Furthermore, usage intensity positively moderated the mediated relationships, amplifying effects among heavy social media users. Findings provide theoretical validation of how influencers act as digital opinion leaders. By enhancing destination image through compelling portrayals, influencers shape audience travel interests and behaviors.

Agricultural Producer Markets in the Maldives: How Poor Market Connectivity Between Farmers and the Markets can be Enhanced,Van Driessche P.A.,2024,10.1177/09730052231161897,"In 2018, a multisite case study investigated the agricultural challenges faced by Maldivian farmers and farming stakeholders. The study interviewed a total of 373 farmers and stakeholders from 51 islands across 15 atolls. In their own words, farmers and stakeholders identified factors in macro and micro levels agricultural systems that are related to poor connectivity between farmers and the markets. This research article conducts a deeper investigation into these factors using the Ecological Systems Theory. In this investigation, the data clearly reveal that any efforts towards market connectivity resolution must address the individual within the context of the greater, extrinsic challenges present in the interrelated systems of farming in the Maldives. While the individual is placed at the smallest level of a greater system, and the interconnections of the larger systems are great in impact, the individual is ultimately the decision maker on what and how things work, and how effective they will be. In this article, five recommendations are identified to enhance farmers’ connectivity to markets. This first-person perspective of smallholder farmers is an essential contribution to understanding what measures are needed to address connectivity challenges between Maldivian farmers and the markets they would like to supply. © 2023 The Author(s).",General agriculture; international institutions & organisations; natural resource management; relationship marketing,Sage Publications India Pvt.

To tackle this issue, this study employed a discrete choice experiment and latent class nested logit models for a nuanced exploration of tourist food preferences. This approach captured both tourists’ preference heterogeneity and substitution effects among fast, local, and hometown-style food options. Findings reveal that price, food taste rating, waiting time, service, and environment are key determinants of tourists’ food choices. Our model identified two distinct tourist classes, Local-food-image class and Anti-price-quality class, each displaying unique food preferences and substitution patterns. This research contributes to tourism and hospitality literature by offering an updated and nuanced understanding of post-pandemic tourists’ food preferences and decision-making trade-offs. It offers practical recommendations for targeted marketing and effective resource allocation, ultimately strengthening resilience and fostering sustainable development within hospitality, catering, and tourism sectors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Discrete choice experiment; Food preference; Hospitality manager; Latent class nested logit; Local food; Willingness-to-pay,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
How does electronic word of mouth on Instagram affect travel behaviour in Indonesia: A perspective of the information adoption model,Silaban P.H.; Chen W.-K.; Sormin S.; B. P. Panjaitan Y.N.; Silalahi A.D.K.,2023,10.1080/23311886.2022.2163525,"Today, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is considered one of tourism businesses’ most effective forms of communication. Using eWOM on social media as an alternative decision aid can benefit consumers. This study examines the information adoption model to determine how consumers adopt eWOM on Instagram, and the subsequent influence on their travel behaviour. This study identifies the need for information as a predictor of information usefulness, converted to adoption and visit intentions. To test the research hypotheses, 263 respondents who had visited destinations based on eWOM recommendations on Instagram participated in the experiment. The data were analysed using a structural equation modelling approach using Smart-PLS 3.0. The findings indicate that the need for information is the most significant factor affecting the usefulness of the information. Furthermore, source credibility and argument quality are critical factors in enhancing the information’s usefulness. Thus, this study has significantly contributed to the theory by adding the need of information to predict visit intentions in the IAM model. Consumers are more likely to adopt high-quality information and convert it into a visit intention. This study provides practical guidelines for tourism managers who wish to utilise social media platforms (e.g., Instagram) as marketing communication tools to encourage eWOM about their destinations. © 2023 The Author(s).

Changes in Preferences and Attitudes Towards University Selection in the Post-Covid Era,Juříková M.; Kocourek J.; Káčerková E.,2024,10.18421/TEM132-15,"– General societal developments show that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about lasting changes in attitudes towards education and lifestyle, among others. The presented study aims to verify, using a quantitative questionnaire survey method on a sample of 500 respondents each, whether there have been changes in the preferences of potential students at a selected university in the Czech Republic between pre-Covid (2017) and post-Covid (2022) years. Current studies show that the post-COVID decision-making process is, among other things, generally more affected by the relationships with family and friends. Also, the paper’s goal is to verify whether this fact also applies to the area of preferences of university applicants and whether it is differentiated by gender. Based on the statistical testing and interpretation of the data, recommendations will be formulated for the marketing management of universities concerning how to adapt to changes in the preferences of applicants and how to effectively adjust the communication mix and message to the given target group, thereby increasing its interest in studying at the university. The proposed measures will thus contribute to increasing the competitiveness of universities, as they identify opportunities to target potential students more effectively. © 2024 Martina Juříková, Josef Kocourek & Eliška Káčerková; published by UIKTEN.

Marketing or methodology? Exposing the fallacies of PLS with simple demonstrations,Rönkkö M.; Lee N.; Evermann J.; McIntosh C.; Antonakis J.,2023,10.1108/EJM-02-2021-0099,"Purpose: Over the past 20 years, partial least squares (PLS) has become a popular method in marketing research. At the same time, several methodological studies have demonstrated problems with the technique but have had little impact on its use in marketing research practice. This study aims to present some of these criticisms in a reader-friendly way for non-methodologists. Design/methodology/approach: Key critiques of PLS are summarized and demonstrated using existing data sets in easily replicated ways. Recommendations are made for assessing whether PLS is a useful method for a given research problem. Findings: PLS is fundamentally just a way of constructing scale scores for regression. PLS provides no clear benefits for marketing researchers and has disadvantages that are features of the original design and cannot be solved within the PLS framework itself. Unweighted sums of item scores provide a more robust way of creating scale scores. Research limitations/implications: The findings strongly suggest that researchers abandon the use of PLS in typical marketing studies. Practical implications: This paper provides concrete examples and techniques to practicing marketing and social science researchers regarding how to incorporate composites into their work, and how to make decisions regarding such. Originality/value: This work presents a novel perspective on PLS critiques by showing how researchers can use their own data to assess whether PLS (or another composite method) can provide any advantage over simple sum scores. A composite equivalence index is introduced for this purpose. © 2022, Mikko Rönkkö, Nick Lee, Joerg Evermann, Cameron McIntosh and John Antonakis.",Composites; Measurement; Model testing; Partial least squares; Structural equation models; Theory testing,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
Esports in Emerging Markets: A Balanced Scorecard Approach to LAN Gaming Centers in Iran,Abdolmaleki H.; Pizzo A.D.; Baker B.J.; Mahmoudi A.; Ghahfarokhi E.A.,2023,10.1080/24704067.2023.2261444,"Esports, competitive video gaming competitions, are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with their growth in emerging markets contingent on local area network (LAN) gaming centers. LAN gaming centers are integral in emerging economies as they provide access to gaming technology and infrastructure that may be otherwise unavailable. Given their importance, the purpose of our study is to identify characteristics relevant to LAN gaming center operations within the context of an emerging market. We conducted a two-phase, multimethod analysis of LAN gaming centers in Iran, an emerging yet dynamic market. In the first phase, we used a balanced scorecard (BSC) approach to identify business factors salient to LAN gaming center operations. In the second phase, we collected data from LAN gaming center consumers (N = 330) to rank the factors by importance using a multi attribute decision-making (MADM) model. We found that business factors relevant to LAN gaming centers operations include: offering a variety of services, providing attractive and modern facilities, employing sports marketing methods, monitoring competition, and developing multiple streams of revenue. via the BSC, our research offers strategic recommendations for LAN gaming centers. LAN gaming centers provide access to modern gaming technology and help consumers overcome technological limitations by providing a physical space for esports. LAN gaming centers help create a sense of community and social connection for players and fans alike and facilitate how consumers in emerging markets connect with the global esports community. © 2023 Global Alliance of Marketing & Management Associations (GAMMA).",balanced scorecard; emerging markets; Esports; Fuzzy Delphi; strategy,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Mediating effects of relationship marketing orientation and service quality orientation on policyholder retention in non-life insurance services,Yu T.-W.,2024,10.1108/APJML-10-2023-1014,"Purpose: This study explores the mediating effects of relationship marketing orientation (RMO) and service quality orientation (SQO) on market orientation, selling orientation, and policyholder retention in non-life insurance services. Additionally, it offers important recommendations for non-life insurers in Taiwan for policy development and improving policyholder retention. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of policyholders belonging to the top five non-life insurance companies in Taiwan. The data were then analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings: RMO and SQO mediate the effects of the salesperson’s market orientation on policyholder retention. Thus, RMO and SQO are key factors influencing policyholder retention. Consequently, high levels of market orientation should be maintained to increase RMO and SQO, strengthening the retention rate of non-life insurance policyholders. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature. In the future, researchers should collect data from other countries and service industries (e.g. banks, securities, and other financial institutions), expand to different insurance contexts (e.g. life insurance), and conduct longitudinal studies or experimental research. Practical implications: The results of this study can act as a guide for providers of non-life insurance services. Based on the research results, we recommend decision-makers pay increased attention to increasing policyholder retention rates by strengthening their firm’s RMO and SQO. Originality/value: Few studies have investigated the relationships among market orientation, selling orientation, RMO, SQO, and policyholder retention in non-life insurance services within Asian contexts in general and specifically in Taiwan. Thus, this study’s theoretical contributions, managerial implications (especially for decision-makers), and the proposed future research directions represent timely and valuable additions to the literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Market orientation; Policyholder retention; Relationship marketing orientation; Selling orientation; Service quality orientation,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
Sustainability process innovations resulting in new value-added byproducts: principal lessons from second-order system-dynamics engineering (SOSDE),Shamsuddoha M.; Woodside A.G.,2023,10.1108/JBIM-05-2022-0193,"Purpose: Second-order system-dynamics engineering (SOSDE) involves constructing and running enterprise manufacturing simulation models with new proposals for operational processes, byproducts, supply chain and/or downstream marketing designs. This paper aims to describe sustainability the principal lessons from enacting SOSDE research for achieving goals in large manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a case research commentary in the agricultural industry that contributes abductively derives six principal lessons from SOSDE research on introducing sustainability-focused manufacturing and product innovations. Operational processes in large-scale poultry processing plants in an emerging market represent the specific industry and firm domain of this case study. Alternative SOSDE simulation models of decisions, materials flow and outcomes with versus without operational innovations were constructed following one-to-one interviews with experienced farm managers and entrepreneurs. Findings: The principles demonstrate how large farms in a developing nation (i.e. Bangladesh) go about adopting radically innovative manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations to improve traditional operations. This study confirms and expands on the general observation that SOSDE can help achieve sustainability and environmental, social and governance goals, contribute new value outcomes by converting unused production wastes into valuable byproducts and introduce design efficiencies in production, supply chain and marketing processes. SOSDE complements, while being a revolutionary departure from, “six sigma management programs” that focus on achieving exceptional and near mistake-free manufacturing operations. Both represent distinct philosophies and sets of actions that sometimes can conflict with one another. Embracing both successfully in the same enterprise is a goal that may appear unreachable, seemingly impossible to achieve and yet represents a manufacturing/marketing epitome that is observable in exceptional enterprises. Research limitations/implications: This paper may generate controversy as well as advance interest in applying SOSDE in introductions of improved manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations aiming to accomplish radical improvements in sustainability goals. Practical implications: This commentary describes how using SOSDE and running alternative production simulations with versus without including superior, radically new, process innovations enable the firm to find and eliminate glitches in system changes and reduce the fear associating with breakdowns and financial losses due to inadequate knowledge of operating new industrial procedures and outcomes. Social implications: Introductions of superior radically new innovations in industrial manufacturing and marketing via SOSDE frequently include manufacturing firms embracing new environment sustainability objectives and additional marketable byproducts from the firm's main productions lines. This commentary offers details on how this process is enacted in poultry manufacturing in an economically emerging nation. Originality/value: Running simulations in SOSDE research offers a low-cost, fast and in-depth method to test “what-if” impacts of enhanced and radical innovations into product/service manufacturing operations – benefits supporting the recommendation to apply systems dynamics in business and industrial marketing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Radical innovation; SOSDE; Supply chain; Sustainability; System dynamics,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
The Impact of the Use of Augmented Reality on Online Purchasing Behavior Sustainability: The Saudi Consumer as a Model,AL Hilal N.S.H.,2023,10.3390/su15065448,"This study aimed to examine the impact of augmented reality (AR) on the purchasing behavior of Saudi customers using analytic–descriptive methods and data from a snowball sample of 812 online buyers. Positive correlations were found between AR factors (hermeneutic, embodiment, and background) and dimensions (quality, fun, and creativity) and the purchase experience. Young women aged 17–26 mainly use AR for buying clothes and accessories, and the majority of the sample shops are available locally through mobile apps. The findings indicate that AR has a significant influence on buying decisions and suggest its potential use in marketing communications. The results also reveal that gender, social status, education level, and monthly income have an impact on participants’ responses to AR, with women and those who are married having more favorable views. Clothing and accessories were found to be the most frequently purchased products through AR. There were no significant differences based on age or the number of family members. Participants reported positively about their AR experience, and their concerns and anxiety did not affect their purchasing experience. Based on the main study’s results, a number of recommendations can be made: Saudi businesses need to use AR in their marketing communication strategies to meet consumer needs and trends. To maximize the benefits of brand awareness, they should use AR techniques and adopt this technology for products that depend on design in their production. When using AR in general and in light of the theories that have been studied, it is important to think about the cultural traits and dimensions of Saudi consumers and conduct further exploratory research before implementation. © 2023 by the author.",advertising; augmented reality (AR); marketing communications; online buying; purchasing decisions,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),scopus-recommendation
Cashless economy – the nexus of COVID-19 and E-wallet usage intentions: a multi-group analysis between formal and informal sector workers in Ghana,Amankwa E.; Amissah G.; Okoampa-Larbi R.,2023,10.1108/JSTPM-09-2021-0137,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to offer a conceptual model that bridges gaps in the current research by combining constructs from the health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Furthermore, the researchers applied the constructed model to analyse the determinants of workers’ intentions to use e-wallet payment options for business transactions rather than physical currency during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the paper examines whether there are any significant variations in the usage intentions of Ghanaian workers in the formal and informal sectors. Design/methodology/approach: The non-probability convenience sampling technique was used to compile the primary respondents among Ghanaian users of e-wallets. Based on constructs derived from the HBM and TPB, an online survey involving the use of a questionnaire was administered to collect quantitative data from 285 formal and informal sector workers in Ghana. Data collected was analysed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling approach involving the measurement, structural model tests, hypothesis tests and multi-group analysis (MGA) tests. Findings: This study reveals that workers’ attitudes, subjective norms and perceived susceptibility as the main determinants of intentions to use e-wallets, as the analysis of data lends support to hypotheses involving these constructs. Perceived behavioural control was however not supported by the data analysis as a determinant of workers’ intention. Finally, there were no significant differences between e-wallet usage intentions of formal and informal sector workers in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: Given the ongoing pandemic, the study recommends that governments of emerging economies should formulate policies that promote the use of e-wallets, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and at the same time contribute to the quest for a cashless economy. However, the results of the study are only based on data collected from workers in Ghana. Therefore, practitioners should apply the recommendations with discretion and make modifications where necessary. The results of the study also provide evidence from the context of a developing country that can support future academic pursuits. Practical implications: This study provides evidence that influences practitioners’ decisions and practices regarding the design and implementation of e-wallet services and innovations among workers in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. Originality/value: This study provides useful business insights to user acquisition managers, marketing managers and business development managers during the formulation of policies, strategies and approaches for their mobile wallet subscriber base. Moreover, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first to apply the constructs of the HBM (mainly applied in health research) to the study of workers’ intentions to use e-wallets. It, therefore, makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by examining the combined effects of the constructs of the HBM and the TPB on workers’ intention to use e-wallets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Attitude; Cashless economy; COVID-19; E-wallet; Intentions; Mobile money; Perceived severity; Perceived susceptibility; Subjective norm; Theory of planned behaviour,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
Financial Literacy of Customers of the Selected Slovak Bank as a Basis for Managerial Decision-Making,Kicova E.; Ponisciakova O.; Rosnerova Z.,2023,10.2478/jec-2023-0008,"Research purpose. The main goal of the article is to determine the current level of financial literacy among clients of the selected bank in Slovakia. This finding will be compared with the average level in the country. In the survey, we focused on determining their financial literacy level. Currently, a lot of attention is paid to the issue of financial literacy. In connection with financial literacy, a lot is said about education. Therefore, in the paper, we focused on finding out the relationship between financial literacy and the level of education as such. We also compared the financial literacy of the survey sample with the overall financial literacy in Slovakia. Design / Methodology / Approach. For the purposes of this article, an anonymous online questionnaire survey focused on the financial literacy of customers of the selected bank was conducted. By analysing theoretical knowledge and existing surveys, we established hypotheses, which we subsequently verified statistically. When analysing theoretical knowledge and surveys in the Slovak Republic, we found that there is a large number of surveys focused on financial literacy. The output and support of each of them are primarily focused on increasing financial literacy through education. We, therefore, assumed, given that financial literacy has been in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools for several years, that financial literacy is related to the availability of goods. We also assumed that financial literacy in the Slovak Republic is increasing. To verify the hypothesis, we used two statistical methods - the Chi-Square test and the Mean Congruence Test. The reason for choosing customers of a specific bank for the purposes of our survey was the number of respondents' answers. We managed to collect the most answers for the bank mentioned. Findings. Through the selected statistical method, we found that in our survey, the number of correct answers is not affected by the level of education. It was also interesting to find that the level of financial literacy of the selected region in 2022 is not higher than the overall level of financial literacy of the Slovak Republic determined on the basis of a survey from 2012. Originality / Value / Practical implications. The proposals and recommendations that emerged from the survey relate to increasing the financial literacy of customers of the selected bank. We focused our recommendations on education and conducting surveys, both for customers and for the bank's management. The bank can use these recommendations as a basis for managerial decisions. It is necessary to increase the financial literacy of customers. It is also necessary to support the field of marketing, especially communication with customers. It is only up to the management of the bank to decide which customers it will have and how it will retain or expand them.  © 2023 Eva Kicova et al.",Customer; Financial literacy; Management; Managerial decision-making,Sciendo,scopus-recommendation
Consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking: decision-making analysis through AHP,Ahmad M.; Zafar M.B.; Perveen A.,2024,10.1108/JIMA-02-2023-0036,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the comparative importance of factors influencing the customer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking for consumer finance in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: First, a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature was conducted to identify a broad range of factors related to customer shift behavior. Through an expert sampling, 14 essential factors were chosen for further investigation. Second, a questionnaire was developed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). This questionnaire was then distributed among customers who had previously been using conventional banking services but had made a shift toward Islamic banking. The purpose of this questionnaire was to gather data and insights regarding their motivations and decision-making process behind the shift, and a sample 215 customers are taken in the study. Findings: The results of AHP depicts that the religiosity is a most important factor influencing customers to shift from conventional to Islamic banking, and the second most important factor is pricing. The other subsequent important factors are reputation of the bank, marketing and promotion, service quality, behavior of banks staff, Shariah compliance, management, convenience, fastness and charges/fees. Whereas documentation, ambiance and recommendation are found least important factors to patronize Islamic banking. Practical implications: The study recommends Islamic banks to create awareness, concentrating on religious factor to have a greater impact on growth of Islamic banking and shrinking of conventional banking. Further, it suggests Islamic banks to apply Shariah-recommended approach of doing business, to help community in best possible way and to launch differentiated marketing techniques to attract customers. It also proposes regulatory authorities to provide facilitation to Islamic banking business by providing level playing field similar to conventional banking, tax equality and conversion of public financing from conventional banking to Islamic banking. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its comprehensive analysis of factors influencing consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking in the context of consumer finance in Pakistan. By using the AHP, the study provides a structured approach to understanding the relative importance of these factors. This is the uniqueness of the paper that it applies the AHP for the analysis. Furthermore, the study offers practical implications for Islamic banks and regulatory authorities to effectively address and capitalize on this consumer shift trend. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",AHP; Bank selection criteria; Consumer shift; Decision-making; Islamic banking; Islamic consumer finance; Pakistan,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation

This includes food policy decision-making. In the Australian state of Victoria, the Food Policies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (FoodPATH) project aimed to determine the food policy actions that are likely to be effective and acceptable for Victorian Aboriginal Communities. Community-based workshops were held with six Aboriginal Community-Controlled Organisations (ACCOs) in urban and regional Victoria during 2022. A team of at least three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander facilitators guided participants (n = 53) through a series of workshop activities using group model building methods. Group model building is a participatory systems science research method which enables community stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of the system-level drivers of complex problems and co-design actions to address them. Workshop discussions coincided with real-time creation of a visual system map of the interconnected determinants of food choice. Participants used these maps to develop and prioritise actions for improving food environments and nutrition in the community. Participants identified a diverse array of interconnected factors influencing food choice and nutrition in Aboriginal Communities across Victoria. Food access and affordability, junk food marketing, food knowledge and skills and diet and disease were common themes across all sites, while access to junk food, growing local food, traditional Aboriginal foods, and family, Community and culture were key themes in most sites. Results informed a Community-driven agenda, comprising five Community-led actions and five government policy recommendations for improving food environments and nutrition for Victorian Aboriginal Communities. © 2024 The Author(s)",Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander; First Nations; Food environments; Food policy; Group model building; Systems thinking,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation

Reliance on strategic tools such as entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is critical to the growth and survival of new ventures. This empirical study aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between EO and performance of new venture logistics firms in Nigeria. It further explores the contingent effects of social capital and marketing capabilities on the hypothesised direct relationships from a transport industry perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Managers of 650 new venture logistics service providers in selected Nigerian cities were Web-surveyed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. Regression analysis was further performed. Common method variance and other validity checks were assessed. Findings: The 469 valid responses showed a positive relationship between EO and new venture performance (NVP). Social capital and marketing capabilities positively moderate the direct relationship between EO and NVP. Managerial implications suggest that context-specific dynamics must be considered when making strategic EO decisions to aid firm growth and survival. Originality/value: This study directly responds to the contingency approach recommendation of past studies (Anwar et al., 2022; Van Stel et al., 2021; Covin and Wales, 2019) using the logistics service and emerging economy context.

The effect of marketing deception on consumer purchasing decisions-an analytical study of the opinions of a sample of baghdad university students,Al-Heali A.N.,2020,,"The study aims to discover the effect of marketing deception practised by mobile phone companies in after-sales services, whether they are providing guarantee services, after-sales service price, promotion or distribution regarding the decision for consumer purchase. A descriptive analytical method has been selected. Data was collected through a questionnaire that was distributed electronically to random individual samples, represented by graduate students in both the Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology for Post-graduate studies and the Higher Institute for Financial and Accounting Studies / University of Baghdad. The sample size consisted of (60) students while the data analysis showed that there is a correlation between marketing deception of after-sales service and consumer purchasing decision. Marketing deception related to price significantly affects consumer purchase decisions, however marketing deception in service, promotion and distribution does not significantly affect consumer sparks decision. This result is due to the nature of consumer culture, the studied sample and the extent of their understanding of the questions. Amongst the most important recommendations of the study is the necessity of working to activate the role of the Consumer Protection Association to monitor the market in the after-sales services sector by conducting awareness campaigns for consumers of their rights to enhance their ability to test the quality of services provided to them and impose penalties on marketing companies that demonstrate the practice of marketing deception in order to reduce unethical practices.  © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Analytical study; Consumer purchasing decision; Marketing deception,Primrose Hall Publishing Group,scopus-recommendation

In a variety of fields in business, such as finance, marketing, information systems, operations, and healthcare, the selected dependent variable does not inherently have a normal distribution. In the regression context, where the model parameters and independent variables are assumed to be constant, the distribution of the random error component thus influences the distribution of the dependent variable. Here, we study the impact of symmetric and asymmetric error distributions on the performance of the estimated model parameters. To create robust estimates, through a process of trimming the response variable, we study the effectiveness of the trimmed estimators with respect to the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) via a simulation procedure. Accordingly, to minimise the ratio of the mean squared error of the trimmed estimator to that of the OLS, a recommendation is developed for the optimal trimming proportion. © Operational Research Society 2021.",Analytics; kurtosis; mean square error; optimal trimming proportion; simulation; skewness; trimmed estimator,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Health technology assessment processes: a North-South comparison of the evaluation and recommendation of health technologies in Canada and Chile,Mansilla C.; Kuhn-Barrientos L.; Celedón N.; de Feria R.; Abelson J.,2022,10.1108/IJHG-10-2021-0108,"Purpose: Health systems are progressively stressed by health spending, which is partially explained by the increase in the cost of health technologies. Countries have defined processes to prioritize interventions to be covered. This study aims to compare for the first time health technology assessment (HTA) processes in Canada and Chile, to explain the factors driving these decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This is a health policy analysis comparing HTA processes in Canada and Chile. An analysis of publicly available documents in Canada (for CADTH) and Chile (for the Ministry of Health (MoH)) was carried out. A recognized political science framework (the 3-I framework) was used to explain the similarities and differences in both countries. The comparison of processes was disaggregated into eligibility and evaluation processes. Findings: CADTH has different programmes for different types of drugs (with two separate expert committees), whereas the MoH has a unified process. Although CADTH’s recommendations have a federal scope, the final coverage is a provincial decision. In Chile, the recommendation has a national scope. In both cases, past recommendations influence the scope of the evaluation. Pharmaceutical companies and patient associations are important interest groups in both countries. Whereas manufacturers and tumour groups are able to submit applications to CADTH, the Chilean MoH prioritizes applications submitted by patient associations. Originality/value: Institutions, interests and ideas play important roles in driving HTA decisions in Canada and Chile, which is demonstrated in this novel analysis. This paper provides a unique comparison to highly relevant policy processes in HTA, which is often a research area dominated by effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Health policy; Health technology assessment; Health-care reform,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Tourism Competitiveness by Shift-Share Analysis to way-forward Destination Management: A case study for Sri Lanka,Fernando I.N.,2020,10.29036/jots.v11i21.139,"Hospitality and Tourism are among the fastest-growing sectors and the source of foreign exchange with indirect-direct employments for quite an appreciable number of economies worldwide. The nature of the sector provides an avenue towards regional development through entrepreneurship venture creations, value addition to the abandoned resources, and regeneration of abandon natural resources with new themes as a novel approach. Tourism currently in a paradigm shift as a comparative advantage of destination is becoming less important than a competitive advantage. The traditional destinations are diminishing while creating novel destinations more relaxation-oriented while leading to residents' economically enriched livelihood. The paper critically analyzes the current tourism competitive position of Sri Lanka with a panel of five rival destinations by adopting shift-share analysis by developing two propositions. Regional Tourism arrivals in rival tourism destinations have been used to perform Shift-share analysis. Findings revealed (a) Sri Lanka as a destination is gaining the competitive advantage of four tourism regions out of six markets. The competitive strategies proposed as recommendations to gain market specialization to the regions with a competitive advantage; (a) market specialization by targeting the markets with a competitive advantage, (b) new marketing programs for markets with competitive disadvantage, and (c) collaborative programs among Asian tourism destinations. The results would be beneficial to Asian region tourism decision-makers trusted with the growth and application of competitive strategies. © 2020 Center for International Scientific Research of VSO and VSPP.

Ryder rides: The synergy between accounting and marketing,Rankin R.; Mintu-Wimsatt A.; Henderson C.,2020,,"The synergy between accounting and marketing is often overlooked despite the implications in strategic decision-making (Roslender & Hart 2006) and cross-functional operations (Cravens & Guilding 1999). Marketing students are rarely exposed to the accounting information they need to be effective decision-makers. Accounting information is typically not included in comprehensive marketing case studies. Yet, management accountants provide financial information and analysis such as product line and individual product profitability, product and customer costs and brand valuations to marketing professionals that is crucial effective decision-making. This case exposes accounting and/or marketing students to the interdependencies of accounting and marketing and provides an opportunity to analyze and evaluate internal financial reports for Ryder Rides® (R2), a company that assembles and sells professional and recreational bicycles. R2 experienced a significant decrease in operating income year-over-year despite selling the same number of bicycles.

A conceptualization of the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption behavior,Abutaleb S.; El-Bassiouny N.M.; Hamed S.,2021,10.1108/JIMA-09-2019-0186,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption contexts. It analyzes the impact of religiosity in influencing consumer life decisions and behaviors. The proposed framework is based on the norm activation theory (NAT) with religiosity added to it based on the extant literature. The paper aims to provide implications for marketing researchers and practitioners derived from its analysis and propositions. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper proposes a model for marketing researchers to consider the role of religiosity as a cultural and psychological factor in influencing online collaborative consumption. The NAT is adopted as the base of the conceptual model. The model posits research propositions on the potential interaction of religiosity with existing relationships in the theory to predict online collaborative consumption behavior. Findings: The NAT is considered a prominent model in studying pro-environmental behaviors and it was adopted in various studies. Some researchers adopted the theory to study collaborative consumption as a pro-environmental behavior. Religiosity was found to significantly impact pro-environmental behaviors, but no research was found regarding its impact on collaborative consumption. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and implications to marketing practitioners about the role of religiosity in influencing collaborative consumption behavior. Originality/value: Although there were few research studies that exist in discussing the role of religiosity in explaining consumer behavior, it could be argued that this paper is the first of its kind, according to the best of the authors’ knowledge, that discusses the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption contexts through the use of NAT. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Collaborative consumption; Norm activation theory; Religiosity; Sharing economy,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Sustainability through the lens of the professional adviser: the case for brand trust,Stoica M.; Hickman T.M.,2022,10.1108/JPBM-05-2021-3466,"Purpose: This investigation builds on two domains. First, professional service providers, such as dentists and veterinarians, represent an understudied link in the distribution channel. Their recommendation of products, such as toothpaste and pet food, are impactful to their clientele. Second, for consumers, sustainability is growing as a motivating factor in product consideration. Consequently, brands committed to sustainability want to promote their products accordingly to connect with the consumer. The purpose of this study is to determine how to trust in sustainable brands is built in the mind of professional service providers, as they are influential in their clients’ decision process. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model that predicted how brand trust of sustainable products is built in the mind of the professional service provider using a sample of 457 veterinarians. Findings: Results revealed that trust in sustainable brands is built via professionals’ expertise in sustainability and their perception of the importance of sustainability. Additionally, the perception of altruistic motivations had a positive impact on brand trust while the perception of strategic motivations had no influence on trust in sustainable brands. Originality/value: Previous studies typically examine sustainability in an organizational context or as a brand consideration factor for consumers. This research focuses on professional service providers, who operate independently of the organization, alongside the formal distribution channel. The study examines how their perception of sustainability importance and their perceived motives of brands engaging in sustainability activities impacts their trust in sustainable brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Brand evaluation; Brand image; Brand trust; Cause related marketing; Professional service provider; Social responsibility; Sustainability; Values,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Measurement model of women’s preferences in obstetrician and gynecologist selection in the private sector: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis,Setoodefar M.; Tabesh H.; Tara F.; Eslami S.; Nabavi F.H.; Zare N.V.; Taheri S.H.; Moghaddam M.R.R.; Etminani K.,2020,10.30476/IJCBNM.2020.82278.1049,"Background: The purpose of this study is to construct and validate a measurement model of women’s preferences in Obstetrician and Gynecologist (OB/GYN) selection in the private sector of non-clinical parameters. Methods: This methodological study included 462 respondents in OB/GYN’s offices to a researcher-made questionnaire. The patients visited 57 offices of OB/GYNs in the city of Mashhad in Iran and completed women’s preferences in OB/GYN selection questionnaire over a 2-month period from January to February 2018. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to verify the instrument’s construct validity. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to test whether the data fit our hypothesized model obtained from EFA model. Results: The first draft of the questionnaire was prepared with 118 items based on literature review. The outcome of content validity assessment was a 51-item questionnaire. Scale-Content Validity Index (S-CVI) turned out to be 0.80. The results of EFA yielded an instrument with 33 items in six domains, which explained 52.657% of the total variance of the questionnaire. With performing CFA, the 6-factor model with 29 items demonstrated a good fit with the data (CFI=0.952, CMIN/DF=1.613, RMSEA=0.036). Availability and Accessibility, Communicational Skills, Office Environment, Recommendation by Others, Special Services, and Cost and Insurance were found to define the women’s preferences in OB/GYN selection in private sector, Iran. Conclusion: The developed measurement model considers the patient’s preferences that influence decision-making process on OB/GYN selection. It can provide useful knowledge for OB/GYNs and policymakers to design appropriate and efficient marketing strategies according to the consumer preferences priority. © 2020, Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

Modeling University Faculty Member’s Digital Image; [Моделирование цифрового имиджа преподавателя вуза],Timokhina G.S.; Popova O.I.; Izakova N.B.,2022,10.15507/1991-9468.109.026.202204.613-636,"Introduction. The discussion of the shaping of a digital image of university faculty member is driven by the need for effective educational interaction between students and faculty in the context of digitalization. However, there are practically no studies of the faculty’s image as a system, as well as technologies for modeling the faculty’s digital image. The objective of this study is to model faculty’s digital image for purposes of decision-making in the process of managing digital image in educational interactions. Materials and Methods. Secondary data were received through methods of content analysis and systemic and structural-functional evaluation of information. Primary data were obtained through comparative marketing study of faculty’s digital image on a sample of 400 students and 92 faculty members of a Moscow-based and a regional university and through an expert survey. Methods of multivariate scaling and analysis of statistically significant differences were also applied. Results. Novelty of the study lies in incorporating basic and instrumental core components in the model of university faculty’s digital image due to a dual role of “digital competence” element. The image modeling technique is also developed. It is noticed that faculty’s digital competence is not only an element in the structure of faculty’s image, but also a tool that transmits the image to external environment. Based on results of the study, recommendations on implementation of technique of faculty member’s digital image modeling are proposed. Revealed differences in opinions of students and faculty of two universities can be attributed to unequal access to digital technologies in different regions. Discussion and Conclusion. Conclusions made by authors contribute to development of scientific thought on shaping and promotion of university faculty’s digital image. Results of the comparative study will enable the Moscow-based and regional universities faculty to differentiate and precisely approach issues of shaping and promoting personal digital image. © 2022 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

Small businesses need to heed customers' needs and innovate for market success,Millson M.R.; Shockley M.,2021,10.1504/IJBIR.2021.113518,"The purpose of this research is to determine how local businesses located in the small, unincorporated, rural community of Castroville in the central coast of California, USA, can innovate to achieve greater market success by reducing community monetary leakage. The source of this community monetary leakage is thought to be outshopping. This study found that outshopping by Castroville residents in communities adjacent to Castroville is responsible for a significant percentage of Castroville's residents' weekly expenditures. Recommendations based on the results of this research include making desired products available in Castroville and pricing them at a level that is clearly within the purchasing power of the Castroville residents. For Castroville residents who work out of the community, desired products must be made available in Castroville for purchase at times of the day and during the days of the week in which these residents can shop in Castroville. Our research also shows that developing innovative newspaper advertisements and utilising marketing mechanisms that focus on special sales and point-of-purchase promotions related to these desired products can help increase Castroville market demand and success.

Embracing public relations (PR) as survival panacea to private colleges’ corporate image & corporate identity erosion,Nyagadza B.; Mazuruse G.,2021,10.1080/23311886.2021.1974179,"The research study explored the role of Public Relations (PR) elements such as seminars and speeches, digital media in creating a positive corporate image and corporate identity and explored how selected private colleges in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe can leverage on publicity to boost students’ enrolment. Extant literature of PR was approached and the Hedging and Wedging theory of communication was used as the theoretical framework for the research. The researcher applied mixed-pluralist research approach, where the qualitative research design was nested into partially quantitative research design. Methodology applied was exploratory, deductively anchored on the critical analysis of the data and discussion of findings to arrive at an informed decision. A purposive sample of 300 students, 30 teachers, 10 college directors and 30 administrators and self-administered closed-ended questionnaires were used in different private colleges. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using AMOS version 6 software, was used to test the propositions. Major findings are that seminars and speeches are less frequently than other digital PR approaches done in private colleges and this can affect the students’ enrolment and survival of the former. Recommendations included the need to make an improvement on carrying out frequently on the seminars and speeches, so as to enhance public image of the former. Budgeting for the PR function in private colleges is crucial. Students need to be involved in the publicity activities of a private college. © 2021 The Author(s).

Three generations on a holiday: Exploring the influence of Neo-Confucian values on Korean Multigenerational Family vacation decision making,Yang M.J.H.; Khoo-Lattimore C.; Yang E.C.L.,2020,10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104076,"Despite being recognised as a lucrative segment by the industry, multigenerational family vacation remains an under-researched area. This study explores Korean multigenerational family vacation decision making (FVDM). Using a neo-Confucian epistemology, this study contributes to the existing family tourism literature, which has mainly researched Western nuclear family holidays, by investigating how Korean multigenerational families resolve conflicts during the FVDM process. Data were collected from 14 Korean multigenerational families using focus groups, interviews and visual methods. The study reveals the influence of neo-Confucianism on FVDM communication and the conflict resolution strategies. The vertical communication across generations was guided by filial piety while the horizontal communication within the second generation demonstrates seniority- and male- oriented values. Given the communication patterns, each generation adopted conflict resolution strategies to maintain family harmony, which is a core value of neo-Confucianism.

This research focus is contextualised with analysis on the CDM process and the disparity between UK and international students, to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the influential factors. The findings of this research point to accreditation, price and rankings having the most influence on CDM among prospective online MBA students. It suggests that the CDM process among international students is more extensive than among UK students. International students’ searches had a longer duration, compared more programme alternatives, favoured detailed information such as course content and marketing materials, and searches often culminated in an application to more than one university. Meanwhile, UK students were more influenced by outbound university phone communications, which the data imply is attributable to English being their first language. Concluding practical recommendations include marketing messaging optimisation, strategic focus on rankings, accreditation and pricing and driving brand loyalty among prospective international students. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",consumer decision-making; Higher Education; Marketing; MBA; online Education,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
The relative merit of two segmentation approaches: executives views and a cost-benefit analysis,Ibrahim A.; Rundle-Thiele S.; Knox K.; Almestarihi R.,2022,10.1108/JSOCM-01-2022-0026,"Purpose: This study aims to capture the views of executives about the merit of using the two segmentation approaches (quantitative vs qualitative). Furthermore, this study aimed to examine costs and benefits for two different segmentation approaches, using a minimax simple cost-benefit analysis (CBA) matrix. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 16 semistructured interviews were conducted with executives within the University of Sharjah (UoS). Furthermore, a minimax approach was applied to the CBA study. Findings: Evidence in this study found that the financial cost of quantitative segmentation approaches was higher than qualitative approaches. However, the decision-makers trusted the quantitative approach more regardless of the incurred costs. The study also found that there was a limited knowledge about social marketing and segmentation among executives. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study relate to the methodology applied, the sample selected and the lead research. Another factor is selection bias, which limited this study to one organization’s executives. It is conceivable that middle-level management would have had the desire to participate because they make the recommendations to top management in decision-making. The researcher did not collect precise data on time taken to design, implement and analyses the two segmentation studies, which qualified the precision of the CBA. Also, the fact that the sample includes participants from a relatively narrow range of disciplines should be noted as a limitation of the study. Practical implications: The current study provides a case study demonstrating how CBA provides a dollar amount estimate permitting alternate segmentation approaches to be compared and contrasted, assisting in the value estimation of any social marketing project. Social implications: The paper draws upon two streams of the literature: social marketing and CBA. The paper focused on the understanding of the literature, CBA offers a technique applicable to demonstrating cost savings that can be derived from choosing one method over another. Moreover, CBA assists in understanding the benefits or potential opportunity cost both financially and nonfinancially. Originality/value: This paper presents one of the first studies conducting a CBA to compare and contrast two segmentation approaches in social marketing. The study provides interesting insights into the perceptions of management executives over alternative research methods, although the results are limited to a case study. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Costs-benefit analysis; Qualitative segmentation; Quantitative segmentation; Social marketing,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation
Can an Index Approach Improve Social Marketing Competitor Analysis?,Raciti M.M.,2021,10.1177/15245004211031872,"Background: Competitive forces influence social marketing efforts. Indeed, social marketers often find themselves “shadow boxing” various forms of competition throughout their interventions. Despite the seminal role of competition as a threat to social marketing intervention efficacy, few empirical studies have undertaken competitive analysis or compared the usefulness of competitive typologies. Thus, this paper proposes an index approach to categorize competitive typologies relevant to a specific social marketing intervention in terms of their ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability to the broader social cause domain. The proposed index approach is illustrated with empirical data, undertaking a competitive analysis of forces obstructing efforts to address educational inequality in Australia, then comparing the ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability of 15 competitive typologies noted in the social marketing literature to produce a competitor analysis index. Research Question: Which competitive typologies most effectively frame forces that inhibit educational equality social marketing efforts in Australia? Methods: Via interviews and focus groups, qualitative data were collected from 46 students from low socioeconomic status (LSES) backgrounds at six universities and sought to understand the influence of their home residence’s geographical remoteness on their university participation. The analysis revealed eight participant-identified differential competitors experienced by students from regional, rural and remote settings (LSES-R, n = 25, 54.4%) that were not experienced by those from metropolitan areas (LSES-M, n = 21, 45.6%). Fifteen competitive typologies were identified in the social marketing literature, and their capacity to frame these eight differential forces in terms of their ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability was critiqued. Findings: Unlike their metropolitan counterparts, LSES-R participants experienced situational (n = 3), dispositional (n = 3) and goal pursuit (n = 2) competitive forces. The most effective competition typologies comprised two classification options that were distinctly different and could classify both the unfriendly and friendly competition that exists in social marketing. Five competitor typologies were identified as easy to use, intuitive and generalizable to the broader educational inequality domain. Together, these five competitor typologies form a competitor analysis index for educational inequality researchers and practitioners to enhance their intervention efficacy. Recommendations: Despite widespread agreement as to the importance of competitor analysis in social marketing, the efficacy of various typologies has received little attention. Social marketers are encouraged to critique competitor typologies before selecting those which enable effective decision-making. Furthermore, it is recommended that social marketers use a competitor analysis index comprised of multiple typologies to better capture the nebulous nature of the many different types of competitors that exist in a specific social marketing context. Limitations: The educational inequalities cause and qualitative method may constrain generalisability, but they exemplify the importance of competition typology choice and model how competitor analysis indexes can be developed. © The Author(s) 2021.",competition; educational inequality; regional; typologies; university; widening participation,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation

"Consumers’ Personality Characteristics, Judgment of Salesperson Ethical Treatment, and Nature of Purchase Involvement",Bateman C.R.; Valentine S.R.,2021,10.1007/s10551-019-04312-7,"Successful marketing efforts and professional sales encounters often depend on consumer involvement in the purchase decision process itself, which in turn may impact firm performance. Despite the importance of consumer involvement, research has yet to fully explain the relationship between consumer personality characteristics and the nature of consumer purchase involvement. This study explores the degree to which consumer perception of salesperson ethical treatment helps explain the relationship between consumer personality characteristics and nature of involvement. Data were collected from a large sample of working adults placed in two scenario-based positive professional sales encounters featuring an important purchase decision. The results indicated that adult consumers’ personality characteristics functioned through judgment of salesperson ethical treatment to affect the nature of purchase involvement. Specifically, consumer judgment of salesperson ethical treatment fully mediated a positive relationship between internal locus of control and cognitive (as opposed to affective) involvement. By comparison, consumer judgment of a salesperson ethical treatment partially mediated the positive relationship between emotional awareness and cognitive (as opposed to affective) involvement. The above findings were similar for informational and relational salesperson customer-orientated scenarios. Key implications for selling professionals and sales organizations are discussed, such as augmenting consumers’ self-assessments to increase their perceptions of salesperson ethics and purchase involvement. The limitations and recommendations for future research are also presented. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Consumer personality; Emotional awareness; Locus of control; Purchase involvement; Salesperson ethicality,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,scopus-recommendation

Research on the Tourism Decision-Making Mechanism: A Case Study of American Outbound Tourism,Cong X.,2021,10.28945/4878,"Aim/Purpose This article takes ‘tourism decision-making behavior’ as an entry point, and deeply analyzes the factors influencing the travel decision-making of Chinese ‘American Travel’ tourists and their degree of influence, so as to provide a reference for the development of Chinese outbound tourism. Background With the development of China’s economy and the improvement in people’s level, the outbound tourism market of Chinese residents has developed rapidly. The United States has become an important tourism destination country for Chinese residents’ outbound tourism, and China has also become one of the important tourist source countries of American tourism. However, the rapid development of ‘American tourism’ has also caused competition problems in China’s tourism industry. For example, prices and tourism products have become a means of competition among tourism enterprises. As the main body of consumption, tourists’ decision-making behavior will be affected by various factors. Methodology Drawing lessons from previous scholars’ research results on tourism decision-making behavior, the influencing factors of tourism decision-making behavior are summarized. A theoretical model and index system of factors influencing tourism decision-making behavior of Chinese residents ‘Travel in the United States’ are established, research hypotheses are put forward, questionnaire data are collected, and SPSS and Amos are used to analyze and verify the theoretical model. Contribution This research expands the literature on topics related to tourism decision-making in research and practice. It establishes a theoretical model and index system for the factors that influence the decision-making behavior of Chinese residents’ ‘American Travel’ tourism. In addition, we propose countermeasures for tourism products, enterprises, and the government. Findings Prior knowledge and external information have a positive influence on tourism perception and value perception, and a negative influence on risk perception. Risk perception value perception has a positive and negative influence on tourism decision-making and tourism motivation, respectively. Tourism motivation has a positive influence on tourism decision-making and has a positive impact. Recommendations According to the research conclusions of this article, the following counter-for Practitioners measures and suggestions are put forward from three aspects of tourism: products, enterprises, and governments. On the basis of existing tourism products, relevant operating companies should pay more attention to the upgrading and transformation of tourism, leisure and entertainment products in scenic spots to increase the willingness of tourists to travel. When considering corporate marketing and promotion plans, tourism companies operating related businesses should increase the weight of their marketing budgets in online marketing, increase investment in online marketing, and develop mobile applications that meet the preferences of Chinese residents in the United States. Do a good job in the timely publication of safety reminders and local information. Safety is an important foundation for tourism development and the core concern of many tourists. Future Research Due to the important research on the impact of tourism activities, the influencing factors are many and complex, and the psychological process of tourism decision-making is carried out directly. There are still unconsidered factors that need to be studied in depth.

Consumer preference analysis: A data-driven multiple criteria approach integrating online information,Guo M.; Liao X.; Liu J.; Zhang Q.,2020,10.1016/j.omega.2019.05.010,"Multiple criteria approaches can assist the product manager to know the consumer preferences in the context of e-commerce. Consumer preference analysis explains what aspects of a product affect and how they affect a consumer's purchasing decision. This issue plays an important role in e-commerce platforms from its relevance in marketing decisions such as advertisements, recommendations and promotions. In this regard, we propose a data-driven multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) approach to integrate online information, such as explicit (e.g., reviews and ratings) and implicit (e.g., clicks and purchases) feedback from consumers. However, MCDA approaches present a critical challenge that even an experienced product manager could find it difficult to pre-define the criteria on which a product is evaluated. To address this issue, our proposed approach first utilizes text-mining techniques to assist the product manager identify the criteria, and then determines and collects the relative importance of the criteria and their values. Given the criteria information, we use a sampling process to provide two indices, the consumer preference index and rank acceptability index. The first index helps in prioritizing the pairwise comparisons of products, while the second one helps in deriving a default ranking list for first-time-registered consumers. We record the products viewed by consumers and generate their preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons for analyses within an aggregation-disaggregation paradigm. We also provide a representative value function to help the product manager gain insight into the preferences. Finally, we describe how a real-world application including the product manager and consumers exploits the proposed approach on an e-commerce platform to take a large step toward aiding more realistic and data-driven multiple criteria decision making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",E-commerce; Multiple criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preference analysis; Preference modeling,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Addressing Marine Wildlife Entanglement in Derelict Fishing Nets Using Community-Based Social Marketing: Case Study and Lessons Learnt,Sarrouf Willson M.; Turley C.; Daar L.A.; Al Masroori H.; Al Muscati H.; Al Aufi M.; Al Bulushi A.; Al Harthi S.; Willson A.,2021,10.1177/15245004211053841,"Background: Entanglement of marine species, particularly endangered sea turtles and cetaceans, in abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear is a major conservation concern. Focus of the Article: This case study applies Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to reduce marine wildlife net entanglement in the waters surrounding Masirah Island, a marine biodiversity hotspot in Oman. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The study demonstrates the use of social marketing tools in biodiversity conservation, bringing new knowledge to the cross-application of these two fields. Methods: The CBSM methodology was applied to select behaviours, identify barriers and benefits, develop strategies and design a pilot study. The responsible disposal of derelict nets in skip bins was selected as the target behaviour, and a mix of behavioural change tools was applied to achieve change: convenience (installation of three skip bins), education (installation of informative signs, distribution of awareness posters, one-to-one engagement with fishers on the beaches), prompts (installation of signs and posters on vessels) and social norms (one-to-one engagement with key influencers and decision makers). The monitoring of behaviour change took place through structured observations over 23 weeks, focussing on the number of nets disposed of in the allocated skip bins. Results: Results showed a low level of behaviour adoption rate by skiff and launch vessel fisheries, respectively, 5.36% and 2.58%. Positive results were observed for a short time but did not reach the estimated target value throughout the study period. Recommendations for Research: Our pilot study did not lead to broad-scale implementation and we recommend further awareness and engagement with the target audience, trials of various behaviour change tools and increase field monitoring time. We further recommend the application and funding of behaviour change methods applied to fishers with the incorporation of conventional financial, conservation and regulatory tools to support resource management. Limitations: Our results show that focussing on specific behaviours with appropriate measurement is both resource and time demanding to solve pressing conservation problems, particularly ones generated by complex industries such as fishing. Various lessons, useful for other social marketers, have been drawn from our evaluation of the overall study. © The Author(s) 2021.",behaviour change; community-based social marketing; marine wildlife; net entanglement; Oman,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation
What are the informational pathways that shape people’s use of cannabidiol for medical purposes?,Zenone M.A.; Snyder J.; Crooks V.A.,2021,10.1186/s42238-021-00069-x,"Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is commonly used to manage symptoms in conditions and diseases for which there is limited clinical research for its application. How consumers arrive and decide to use CBD for medical treatment, despite lacking clinical evidence, is largely unknown. In this paper, we seek to identify the informational pathways through which consumers arrive at CBD for medical purposes. Methods: GoFundMe.com campaigns fundraising to purchase CBD between June 2017 and May 2019 were collected using the Crowdfunding for Health Research Portal (CHRP). Product descriptions were thematically analyzed to determine pathways leading to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment. Campaign characteristics such as fundraising ask, funding received, location, campaign title, description, Facebook shares, and number of donors were recorded. Specific medical uses of CBD proposed in campaigns were tabulated. Results: The study identified 164 crowdfunding campaigns primarily from the USA (n=159), with several from Canada (n=5). The campaigns requested $2,219,284.24 (median, $7000) and raised $610,612.87 (median, $1805) from 6825 donors (median, 26). Many campaigns asked for other treatments or illness-related costs not specific to CBD. The campaigns were shared 42,299 times on Facebook (median, 156 shares). Three informational pathways were identified leading to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment, which were self-directed research (n=149), recommendations from a trusted care provider (n=36), and/or experiential insights shared by someone associated with or influencing the crowdfunders personal network (n=30). The proposed uses of CBD were for cancer (n=96), seizure-inducing diseases/conditions (n=48), other/unspecified (n=6), joint/inflammatory diseases (n=6), mental health disorders (n=3), nervous system diseases (n=3), and autoimmune diseases (n=2). Conclusions: Our results suggest that consumers crowdfunding come to CBD through internally motivated reasons versus exposure to advertisements or other forms of marketing. Campaign beneficiaries generally had an unmet medical need that other forms of treatment were not satisfying. Then, through one or more of the informational pathways identified, CBD is considered a potential solution. © 2021, The Author(s).",Cannabidiol; Cannabis; Crowdfunding; Decision-making; Medical treatment,BioMed Central Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Mobile marketing tools in the market of restaurant food delivery services in Ukraine,Spivakovskyy S.; Spivakovska T.; Bazherina K.,2021,10.33182/tmj.v9i1.1015,"This study explores the usage of mobile marketing tools in the market of restaurant food delivery services. While new mobile tools become available, the enterprises need to rationally select and use those tools. In the study, the market of restaurant food delivery in Ukraine has been analyzed, and the enterprises operating in the market have been classified based on their business processes. It was discovered that the usage of mobile marketing differs for aggregators and food producers, depending on their business processes and marketing goals. For each group of enterprises operating in the market, classification of mobile marketing tools has been done, and approaches for selecting mobile marketing tools by the stages of a purchase decision process have been proposed, based on marketing objectives at every stage of the purchase process. Online customer survey has been conducted, and the Kano model has been applied to estimate customers' satisfaction and their attitude toward mobile marketing tools. Based on the research results, the practical recommendations for selecting the most suitable mobile marketing tools have been developed, and these recommendations take into account the interests of both sides: customers and companies implementing marketing tools. It was found out that the main selection criteria include enterprise internal business processes, marketing objectives, and customer attitudes. The recommendations developed in this study, provide businesses with the approaches necessary to rationally allocate their marketing resources. © 2021.

Dupe influencers exploiting social media to peddle luxury fakes,Chaudhry P.E.,2022,10.1016/j.bushor.2022.07.005,"Dupe—slang for duplicate—influencers are individuals who persuade buyers to purchase counterfeits using social media platforms to drive a brand message intended to confer legitimacy on the purchase decision. Dupe influencers sell fake luxury goods online to their cadres of followers, who relate to the influencers’ fashion savviness and who trust their judgment of products’ quality. In this article, I provide a synopsis of a case Amazon settled against two dupe influencers who used social media to promote the sale of counterfeit luxury products. I highlight the persistent challenge of luxury counterfeits sold online, the consumer complicity of obtaining luxury fakes, and the problem of discerning a knockoff from a counterfeit product. Dupe influencers leverage trust with their followers and use social media tactics, such as unboxing videos and designer haul promotions, to peddle luxury fakes. Recommendations to combat dupe influencers center on monitoring and working with e-commerce platforms to shut down social media posts that infringe a company's intellectual property, raising consumer awareness of the illicit activities of counterfeiters through education campaigns, leveraging legitimate social influencers to debunk the dupe influencers, and pursuing legal remedies. © 2022 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Counterfeit goods; Dupe influencer; Influencer marketing; Social media marketing; Trademark infringement,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Marketing while Black: commentary on the Galak and Kahn 2019 Academic Marketing Climate Survey,Bradford T.W.; Perry V.G.,2021,10.1007/s11002-021-09580-w,"Diversity serves to enrich decision-making, innovation, reputation, and performance. The marketing academy, a microcosm of business and society, is making slow advances in diversity efforts. The study by Galak and Kahn (2021) seeks to codify experiences of gender and race within the marketing academy to elevate awareness and to provide recommendations that may address some of the issues raised. In this commentary, we focus on opportunities to more deeply investigate the complex impact of race on careers and advancement in the marketing academy. Essential further research would advance our understanding of the role of systemic racism—and how it affects the people who are given opportunities to become scholars as well as the research they are encouraged to conduct or can successfully publish in top journals. To more fully understand the climate for traditionally underrepresented faculty members in the USA, it likely necessitates a multi-method approach to generate understanding and insights before developing potential recommendations. To address these types of research questions, we propose a set of studies that would allow an understanding of not only how individuals experience racism, but also how that racism is perpetuated through university admissions, hiring, and promotion decisions. We not only recommend approaches to understand how to increase the presence of historically underrepresented groups in Marketing academia, but also how to enable the full integration and participation of these scholars at all levels in the academic hierarchy, and across all types of institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Diversity and inclusion; Intersectionality; Marketing academia; Racial discrimination; Racism,Springer,scopus-recommendation
Customer’s digital advocacy: the impact of reviews and influencers in building trust for tourism and hospitality services,Dutta K.; Sharma K.; Goyal T.,2021,10.1108/WHATT-09-2020-0123,"Purpose: Marketers are focusing on the need for customer advocacy to influence other customers and drive consumption. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether online or digital advocacy influences customer decision-making related to the purchase of travel and tourism services. This paper will also identify the categories of influencers that stimulate purchase for travel and tourism. Influencers do want to know the kind of information customers are looking for. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a primary survey of travelers to understand their degree of dependence on online reviews while making hospitality consumption-related decisions. Findings: This paper looks at both influencer marketing and online reviews by consumers to understand consumption toward advocated brand. Influencers who are perceived as unbiased in their viewpoints are trending on social media. Consumers gain trust in reviews that disclose reviewer information, number of relevant reviews are present over a period and presence of both unbiased positive and negative recommendations related to the establishment and prices versus performance. Practical implications: Marketers and influencers alike can gain from the factors influencing consumer trust toward online advocacy and reviewed information. Originality/value: Research is relevant for all stakeholders as it highlights the fact that consumers are looking at online reviews and one does not have to be a famous personality to influence purchase. It is relevant for influencers, as it highlights reasons for trust and various information cues that consumers are looking for. Research also gives perspective to influencers to refine online strategy and gain trust of more followers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer trust; Customer’s digital advocacy; Electronic WOM; Influencer marketing; Online reviews,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Role of augmented reality in changing consumer behavior and decision making: Case of Pakistan,Kazmi S.H.A.; Ahmed R.R.; Soomro K.A.; Hashem E A.R.; Akhtar H.; Parmar V.,2021,10.3390/su132414064,"Marketers and advertisers ignore new technology and diverse marketing tactics when attempting to increase product exposure, customer engagement, customer behavior and buying intention in fashion accessory marketplaces in developing countries. This research sought to discover how the Augmented Reality (AR) experience influenced consumer behavior, buying intention and pleasure when purchasing a fashion item in developing countries. This study employs positivist ideas to investigate the connections between various factors, believing that reality is unwavering, stable, and static. Experiential marketing following stimulus exposure will gather cross-sectional data. The undertaken study has developed proper experimental design (within group) from business innovation models, for instance, uses and gratification and user experience models. User experience is disclosed by its four defining characteristics: hedonic quality (identification and simulation), aesthetic quality, and pragmatic quality. After encountering an enhanced user experience, users have a more favorable attitude about purchasing; in contrast, pleasure from using the application directly impacts buying intention. It was also shown that knowledge of AR apps impacts user experience and attitude. The novelty of this research is multifarious, for instance, the smart lab was used as a marketing technology to explore a virtual mirror of the Ray-Ban products. Secondly, the augmented reality experiential marketing activities have been developed by the developers as bearing in mind the four different aspects of the user experience—haptic, hedonic, aesthetic, and pragmatic. It should be functional, simple to learn and use, symmetrical, pleasant, and appealing, while fulfilling the unconscious emotional elements of a customer’s purchase. The research is the first known study in Pakistan to evaluate the influence of augmented reality on consumer proficiency and its consequent effects on attitude and satisfaction for fashion accessory brands. The research also advances the notion that application familiarity is the most important moderator between attitude and an augmented reality-enriched user experience, contradicting the prior studies, which focus on gender and age. This research has important theoretical implications for future researchers, who may wish to replicate the proposed final model in developed and developing countries’ fashion brands. This research also has imperative managerial implications for brand managers and marketing managers, who could include the recommendations of this study in their marketing strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

The Role of Media in Sponsorship Decision Making During Covid-19: A Malaysian Perspective,Sharipudin M.-N.S.; Hassim N.; Ayub S.H.; Fam K.-S.; Mohammed R.,2022,10.17576/JKMJC-2022-3802-11,"COVID-19 has impacted not only human lives, but also business organisations. The repercussions of the pandemic on global businesses include sustaining the value of a firm that could benefit stakeholders, such as the challenge for sponsored properties to attain sponsorship through a period of financial struggles and the capacity of a sponsor to provide it. It is imperative for business-to-business (B2B) communities to evaluate criteria and risks of sponsorship to instil public trust and consequently result in value creation for firms. At the same time, the role of the media is pivotal to create visibility of this partnership and achieve set sponsorship aims. With that said, the objective of this study is to explore the role of sponsorship decision making by Malaysian organisations during the pandemic and how the media have strengthened relationship marketing between businesses and their stakeholders; by examining the determinant factors of using media as an activation in sponsorship and the criteria of using media in sponsorship. The qualitative study conducted interviews with 13 corporate communication and marketing managers in Malaysia that are involved directly with sponsorship activation. The findings highlight the sponsorship ecosystem through the Malaysian media and B2B perspectives that would guide practitioners in making strategic decisions on B2B sponsorship matters, particularly on the relational approaches and media engagement should be seen as part of good business conduct. Future recommendation of this research is to seek the perceptions of consumers on the congruence of relationship marketing through sponsor-sponsored properties collaboration in Malaysian media. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

In the face of the rising costs of higher education and declining enrollments, it is critical that curriculum be developed that strikes a balance between the values and needs of faculty, students, and employers. The current study explores the disconnect between courses students most desire to take and courses business professionals most recommend they take for career success. Utilizing Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) and the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV) as lenses to explore student choice in regard to marketing elective course selection, this study offers empirical data on courses preferred by marketing students and recommended by employers.

Through primary data research with n=788 respondents who are currently enrolled in VET across eight schools in Kosovo, the study has identified the critical importance of word-of-mouth through family & relatives, and friends in generating awareness for a given school and sharing information on the school offering. As critical elements to decide to apply for the school have been considered the applicants visit directly to the school to get informed more on the offering and the desire to get equipped with the given qualification the school offers. It is important to note the impact that parents have across all levels from brand awareness development to information search and decision making. The study provides pragmatic recommendations to school management on better optimizing their marketing efforts from a communication channel perspective, such as the importance of the open-days events of the school and the usage of the social media channels (especially Facebook) to communicate their offering. © 2022, Pro Global Science Association.

Post-COVID-19 crisis travel behaviour: towards mitigating the effects of perceived risk,Matiza T.,2022,10.1108/JTF-04-2020-0063,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and its potential influence on tourist behaviour in the short- to medium-term. While the influence of the pandemic on tourist’s perceived risk and its impact on their future travel behaviour is understandably yet to be established, the present paper discusses the potential nexus. Additionally, this paper provides tourism practitioners with some recommendations for mitigating the effect of potential heightened perceived risk on travel and tourism decision-making post the COVID-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper synthesises contemporary academic literature on perceived risk and post-crisis tourism with emerging information associated with the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. Findings: This paper draws empirical evidence from studies related to previous health crises and their impact on tourism, as well as tourist behaviour. By discussing previous studies within the context of the on-going COVID-19, it is possible to anticipate the influence that perceived risk associated with the pandemic may have on the post-crisis behaviour of tourists. Also, short-term measures to mitigate the effects of risk on tourism are posited to guide practitioners in the future recovery of the sector. Research limitations/implications: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and on-going crisis for the global tourism industry. Hence, the present paper serves as a primer to a broader discussion within the tourism discourse and provides theoretical direction for future tourism research. Practical implications: Key to the recovery of the global tourism industry will be encouraging both domestic and international tourism activity. However, while the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on tourist behaviour is yet to be substantiated, previous research predicts a situation of heightened perceived risk and the potential cognitive dissonance that may negatively influence tourist decision-making. To mitigate this potential effect, governance, augmented immigration policy, destination media profiling, recovery marketing and domestic tourism will be critical interventions. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to discuss the potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the post-crisis decision-making process of tourists and their conative behaviour. As a primer to further empirical research, this paper sets a pertinent research agenda for academic inquiry within an evolving and increasingly uncertain global tourism market. © 2020, Tafadzwa Matiza.",COVID-19 pandemic; Perceived risk; The future of tourism; Tourism; Tourism recovery; Travel behaviour,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Green marketing innovation: Opportunities from an environmental education analysis in young consumers,Prieto-Sandoval V.; Torres-Guevara L.E.; García-Díaz C.,2022,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132509,"As a society, we are aiming to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, and one of the most important challenges is fostering responsible production and consumption. Green marketing campaigns and instruction in university curricula are an opportunity to influence producers' and consumers' decision-making process in a positive way. This research aims to understand the instructional effects of non-compulsory university courses linked to sustainability and the circular economy (SCE) on students' motivations and behavior. We analyze students' proclivities to consume products and develop more sustainable habits before and after enrolling in SCE courses. Results confirm that the courses impacted students' propensities toward sustainable consumption. Therefore, the biggest changes in the six dimensions underlying green consumption reveal four key recommendations for developing a green marketing strategy. We recommend firms to 1) engage in green education, 2) create community, 3) be aware of consumer diversity, and 4) not differentiate by gender. For this reason, we argue that university education may greatly influence students' mindset concerning sustainable behavior. Results also revealed no significant gender differences, which contrasts with the differentiated behavior found in extant studies on older populations. © 2022 The Authors",Circular economy; Green marketing innovation; SDGs; Sustainable development; Young consumer behavior,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
From Mix-and-Match to Head-to-Toe: How Brand Combinations Affect Observer Trust,Engeler I.; Barasz K.,2021,10.1093/jcr/ucab041,"Consumers use brands in many combinations, from mixing-and-matching multiple brands (e.g., Nike shoes, Puma shirt, and Asics shorts) to using products primarily or solely from one brand (e.g., Nike shoes, shirt, and shorts). This work explores how such combinations affect observers’ trust in another consumer’s recommendations. Comparing two combination types—mixed-brand combinations (where all/most branded products are from different brands) and dominant-brand combinations (where all/most branded products are from the same brand)—nine studies establish that observers tend to have less trust in recommendations from those who use dominant-brand combinations (studies 1A–1C). This is driven by inferences about how the products were chosen: observers believe others who use dominant-brand combinations placed relatively greater importance on the brand—a feature that often serves as a mental shortcut for choices—and therefore infer these consumers made quicker, less thoughtful decisions (studies 2A and 2B). While the effect diminishes when observers hold particularly favorable attitudes toward the focal brand (study 3), it can alter observers’ own downstream behaviors (e.g., social media following intentions, information seeking, and recommendation taking; studies 4A–4C). Together, the findings confirm that brand combinations elicit responses distinct from single brands, offering fruitful avenues for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.

Personalized product recommendations and firm performance,Basu S.,2021,10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101074,"This paper investigates the incentives of e-commerce platforms to show personalized recommendations and its effects on performance. A theoretical framework is developed that characterizes the optimal decision policy of a firm, given current state of shoppers. The key finding is that the firm must always show recommendations to shoppers in the high state above a certain price or value threshold. In the low state, recommending is optimal if the “salience effect” is above a threshold that maximizes discounted future stream of profits. An empirical model provides support to the theoretical findings, highlighting the reputation effects of personalized recommendations, using browsing and purchase data from a Finnish multi-product platform. While recommendations are associated with a 29% increase in firm revenue, relevance of such recommendations potentially boost revenue by a significant 30%. Furthermore, strong evidence is presented that consumer state is endogenous in firm revenue regressions. A three-step IV process extracts the direct effect of consumer state on revenue which shows positive association between reputation effects and firm performance. © 2021 The Author(s)",e-commerce; personalized recommendations; reputation effects,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation

The complexity of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty, however, has been increasingly acknowledged in marketing thought and practice. The objective of this study is to explore and test the combined roles of perceived risk and destination knowledge in the satisfaction-loyalty intention relationship. The results indicate the direct effects of perceived risk on visitors’ satisfaction and loyalty intentions. Furthermore, perceived destination knowledge is positively related to visitors’ satisfaction and both the intention to make WOM (word-of-mouth) recommendations and to return. In particular, the effects of visitors’ satisfaction on intention to return and to make WOM recommendations become stronger through the positive moderating effect of perceived destination knowledge. The findings clarify the understanding of how perceived risk and destination knowledge can predict the satisfaction and destination loyalty of tourists. This paper provides a number of managerial implications for communication strategies to improve tourist loyalty. Management implications: This study reinforces established ideas for communication strategies to improve European tourist loyalty: Perceived risk is negatively related to both visitors’ satisfaction and the intention to return. Tourists’ satisfaction is positively related to the intention to recommend by WOM. A positive impact on intentional loyalty, perceived destination knowledge helps to increase tourists’ satisfaction.

"Intra-Household Gender Relations and Women Participation in Non-Industrial Private Forestry in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania; [Relations entre sexes et participation des femmes au sein des foyers dans la foresterie privée non-industrielle des terres hautes du sud, en Tanzanie]",Nsenga J.V.; Mwaseba D.L.,2021,10.1505/146554821832140349,"HIGHLIGHTS The family or household provides the major source of labour for undertaking silvicultural practices involved in tree growing. Gender division of labour characterizes silvicultural practices in private forestry. Gender-based allocation of labour is influenced by experience of a household member related to a particular activity as well as competing labour demand in a cropping season. Men play a key and dominant role in decision making on the allocation of labour and marketing of timber. Mere ownership of woodlots by women is not a feasible pathway to having control over income obtained from the sales of timber from their woodlots. SUMMARY This paper draws on a study conducted in the selected districts of Iringa and Njombe regions in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania where over the past decade Non-industrial Private Forestry (NIPF) has emerged involving village-based domestic investors. Data for the study were largely collected using focus group discussions (FGDs) of men and women tree growers. Data were analysed using content analysis focusing on the emerging themes, subthemes, and patterns. The paper shows that gender division of labour characterizes silvicultural practices in private forestry. Men play a key and dominant role in decision making on the allocation of labour and marketing of timber. We argue that, given this arrangement, as long as men continue to dominate the market sphere, mere ownership of woodlots by women is not a feasible pathway to having control over income obtained from the sales of timber from their woodlots. To address this, the paper comes up with some recommendations. © 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

A quantitative investigation on awareness of renewable energy building technology in the United Arab Emirates,Albattah M.; Attoye D.E.,2021,10.3390/su13126665,"Sustainability in architecture engages a wide range of considerations in the light of the significant negative impact of buildings on the environment. One aspect of research in this parlance engages the technological and the social dimensions of building innovation, which promote the use of renewable technology as a mitigation strategy. The challenge, however, is that the end-users or building clients do not always have sufficient awareness and information regarding these technologies to guide their decision to accept it. Consequently, the diffusion of said innovations is slow, and the environmental or building problems they were invented to solve persist at the expense of both humanity and the environment. This study, therefore, focuses on a quantitative investigation to ascertain the level of awareness and interest of residents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) as an example of renewable energy-based building technology. In this study, 289 residents participated, following the distribution of a questionnaire to demographically distinct individuals. This distinction was used in the analysis to highlight different groups such as, gender, generations, and occupational background of the respondents. The findings of the study show, firstly, that there is a high level of awareness of BIPV in the sample. The study also shows that comparing awareness with each of these demographic variables produced a second layer of findings. For example, the statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference between the level of awareness and any of the demographic characteristics of the study participants. However, there is a significant statistical difference (p = 0.000) between awareness and interest in BIPV. In concluding this study, recommendations for further research that elaborates other statistical variables and tests, as well as a follow-up qualitative investigation are planned and outlined for future studies. The findings of this investigation may be of benefit to researchers, policy makers, as well as energy companies and marketing agencies within and outside the region. © 2021 by the authors.

INFLUENCE OF SELECTED DETERMINANTS ON THE PERCEPTION OF BEACHES AS A TOURISM PRODUCT,Magaš D.,2022,10.20867/thm.28.3.15,"Purpose Beaches are icons of summer tourism and a strong motivating factor for the arrival of tourists in the sun and sea tourism destinations. Spending time on the beach is one of the most popular forms of tourism leisure worldwide. Beaches serve both as recreational areas of coastal cities, and valuable ecosystems that provide natural and protective functions. The Croatian coast is relatively rich in this valuable tourism resource, but the management of beaches as a tourist product has not reached significant progress. This dissertation aims to contribute to the sustainable management of beaches as a tourism product and recognises the possibility of involving all stakeholders in this process by studying socio-demographic factors, preferences, satisfaction, and future behavioural intentions of beach visitors. This knowledge can make an important contribution to the beach management process because it can be used to make more informed management decisions. Which characteristics of a particular beach need to be improved, what facilities should be introduced or discontinued, beach managers can find out through social science research methods that can encourage participation of all stakeholders, increase visitor satisfaction and destination competitiveness, and thus lay the groundwork for more sustainable development of beaches as tourism products. The purpose of this doctoral dissertation is to develop a cognitive-affective-conative model of beach visitor satisfaction. This dissertation developed, validated, and tested an empirical model of beach visitor satisfaction by combining the sustainable development framework, international coastal zone management protocols, and national legislation with theories of satisfaction, quality, and consumer behaviour. The empirical model includes measures of beach visitor satisfaction levels with natural beach features, beach facilities, overall beach experience, emotional experience and their future behavioural intention. Methodology The study follows a mixed method design, employing both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method was used for the purpose of testing the links between model constructs. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used in analyses of socio-demographic variable influences of beach visitors. Data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire on three separate beach locations in the Primorsko – goranska county littoral during the summer of 2021, with the paper assisted personal interview (PAPI) technique. A 5-point Likert scale was used in attribute level satisfaction and importance performance measurements. Qualitative methods include investigation by an unstructured inquiry of importance, concerning beach attributes not mentioned in the structured part of the questionnaire, as an opening of an unstructured interview with the beach visitor. Findings of the qualitative analysis have shown that beach visitors also value cultural factors and place high importance on beach sediment quality. Findings The findings of the descriptive statistical analyses concerning socio-demographic characteristics of beach visitors indicate that on average, women (59.4%) visit the beach more than men (40.6%). The most frequent age group of beach visitors is in between 45-54 years old (25.7%), followed by visitors in between 15-24 (21%) years old. Regarding education levels, on average most visitors have finished high school (54.6%) followed by visitors with university level education (43.5%). Foreign tourists make up most of beach visitors (60.2%) while domestic tourists are second most represented (20.7%), followed by local residents (17.2%) and season residents (1.9%). Concerning the habits of beach visitors, they are most likely to visit the beach as a family with children (31.3%), as a couple (26.8%) or with friends (26.3%). Beach visitors will most likely use a car to get to the beach (77.7%), go on foot (12.5%) or use public transport (8.8%). Concerning the time they spend on the beach, most visitors stay in between 3-5 hours long (39.5%), followed by stays in between 1-3 hours long (38.2%) and stays over 5 hours long (21.2%). The descriptive statistical analyses of structural model independent variable constructs for the whole sample of all three beaches, indicates that regarding beach natural characteristics, beach visitors are most satisfied with beach scenery = 4.57, cleanliness of the sea = 4.47 and texture of beach sediment = 4.06. Beach visitors are somewhat satisfied with the opportunities to observe maritime species = 3.42. The least levels of beach visitor satisfaction are with available shade on the beaches = 2.82. Concerning beach visitor satisfaction with beach facilities, all average values of individual attributes are below 4, which indicates that beach visitors are on average more satisfied with the natural beach attributes than facilities available at the beaches. In the overall sample, beach visitors are satisfied the least with lifeguard and/or medical service = 2.90, accessibility to the beach and sea for persons with disabilities = 2.97, rental service of water sport and recreation equipment = 3.12, parking space availability = 3.12, shower availability = 3.13, toilet cleanliness = 3.15 and toilet availability = 3.24. Beach visitors are satisfied the most with bar and restaurant service on the beaches = 3.99, clearly designated safe swimming areas in the sea = 3.88, litter bin availability = 3.88 and with areas for sport, recreation, and children play on the beaches = 3.81. Concerning the descriptive analyses of beach visitor emotional experiences, measured on the Destination Emotion Scale (DES), on average beach visitors feel joy = 4.21 the most, followed by the emotion of love = 3.84 and positive surprise = 3.69. Beach visitor satisfaction with the overall experience at the beaches is on average relatively high = 4.29, as are the intention of revisit = 4.49, and the intention of recommending the beach = 4.35 The results of the bivariate statistical analysis show significant statistical differences in overall experience satisfaction regarding visitor type, while no differences were found by age or gender. Domestic tourists are least satisfied on average, while season residents are satisfied the most. The results partially support hypothesis H1. Significant statistical differences were found in the construct of intention of recommendation by gender and age. Women have a higher intention to recommend the beach than men. Age groups of 15-24 years of age tend to recommend the beach the least, while age groups of 45-54 and 55-64 have the highest levels of recommendation intention. These results partially support hypothesis H2, as no differences were found by beach visitor type. Women also have a higher intention of revisit the beach then men, while local residents and season residents have significantly higher intention of revisit than tourists, partially supporting hypothesis H3, as no differences by age were found. Lastly, the results of multivariate statistical analysis show that satisfaction with natural beach characteristics affects satisfaction with the overall experience at the beach (β=0.529, p<.01), intention to revisit (β=0.37, p<.01) and intention to recommend (β=0.497, p<.01). Thus, confirming hypothesis H4, H5 and H6. Satisfaction with beach facilities affects the overall experience satisfaction with the beach (β=0.189, p<.01), the intention to revisit (β=0.146, p<.01) and the intention to recommend the beach (β=0.106, p<.01) confirming hypotheses H7, H8 and H9. Concerning the impact of beach visitor emotions on the overall beach experience, the results show that joy (β=0.437, p<.01), love (β=0.203, p<.01) and positive surprise (β=0.105, p<.05) have a significant impact. Confirming in this way hypothesis H10. The impact of emotions on revisit intention is also statistically significant for joy (β=0.442, p<.01) and love (β=0.266, p<.01), while positive surprise is not related to revisit intention (β=0.061, p=0.271). By this, hypothesis H11 is partially confirmed. Concerning the effect of emotions on recommendation intention, both joy (β=0.445, p<.01) and love (β=0.27, p<.01) affect recommendation intention, while the relationship with positive surprise is not statistically significant (β=0.047, p=0.333). The results confirm partially hypothesis H12. Satisfaction with overall beach experience is significantly related to the intention of revisit (β=0.585, p<.01) and with the intention of recommendation (β=0.597, p<.01) confirming hypothesis H13 and H14 respectively. Mediation analysis results indicate that emotions partially mediate the relationship between satisfaction with natural beach characteristics and overall experience at the beach, while complete mediation of emotions is established between satisfaction with beach facilities and overall experience satisfaction. Finally, confirming hypothesis H15 and H16 respectively. Originality of the research In an innovative approach, while responding to the calls of several authors from the literature of tourism and marketing for the creation of integrative models of satisfaction with both cognitive and affective components, the Destination Emotion Scale (DES) is used in the context of modelling overall beach visitors’ satisfaction affective component. Furthermore, by assessing the importance of beach facilities at the natural beach, opposed to satisfaction with beach facilities on beaches in urban areas at the same time, an innovative integral assessment of wider coastal area beaches is enabled no matter the beach type. This is achieved by the combination of satisfaction and importance measurements of beach facilities in the overall beach sample. In this manner, the importance of facilities at the natural beach, becomes a control variable, and the results of independent variable attribute level statistical significance measurements may be interpreted as significant, controlling for the fact that beach visitors may have different priorities regarding facilities on the natural beach in a rural setting, than visitors of beaches in urban settings. This dissertation establishes the applicative, theoretical, and empirical validity of the observation of beaches as tourism products. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how this approach incorporates the principles of sustainable development while simultaneously being oriented towards some of the most important theoretical determinants of successful business operations – visitor satisfaction and future behavioural intentions. By assessing the reliability and validity of the empirical model and testing the proposed scientific hypotheses, new insights into the area of beach visitor satisfaction have been explored and revealed, these insights establish emotions as a reliable predictor of beach visitor satisfaction and future behavioural intentions and include different emotional experiences of visitors on a natural beach in a rural environment. © 2022, University of Rijeka.

Geopolitical risk and tourism: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel models,Lee C.-C.; Olasehinde-Williams G.; Akadiri S.S.,2021,10.1002/jtr.2389,"This paper provides an empirical insight into how geopolitical risks impact international tourism demand. An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid-19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre-crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy-makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post-crisis, policy-makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re-establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",covid-19; geopolitical risk; second-generation panel; tourism,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,scopus-recommendation

Adaptive Sequential Experiments with Unknown Information Arrival Processes,Gur Y.; Momeni A.,2022,10.1287/msom.2022.1116,"Problem definition: Sequential experiments that are deployed in a broad range of practices are characterized by an exploration-exploitation trade-off that is well understood when in each time period feedback is received only on the action that was selected in that period. However, in many practical settings, additional information may become available between decision epochs. We study the performance that one may achieve when leveraging such auxiliary information and the design of algorithms that effectively do so without prior knowledge of the information arrival process. Methodology/results: Our formulation considers a broad class of distributions that are informative about rewards from actions and allows auxiliary observations from these distributions to arrive according to an arbitrary and a priori unknown process. When it is known how to map auxiliary observations to reward estimates, we characterize the best achievable performance as a function of the information arrival process. In terms of achieving optimal performance, we establish that upper confidence bound and Thompson sampling algorithms possess natural robustness with respect to the information arrival process, which uncovers a novel property of these popular algorithms. When the mappings connecting auxiliary observations and rewards are a priori unknown, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition under which auxiliary information allows performance improvement and devise an adaptive policy (termed 2UCBs) that guarantees near optimality. We use a data set from a large media site to analyze the value that may be captured by leveraging auxiliary observations in the design of content recommendations. Managerial implications: Our study highlights the importance of utilizing auxiliary information in the design of sequential experiments and characterizes how salient features of the auxiliary information stream impact performance. Our study also emphasizes the risk in processing auxiliary information using nonadaptive approaches that are predicated on correct interpretation of this information, as opposed to deploying flexible, adaptive methods. © 2022 INFORMS.",experiments; OM-marketing interface; pricing and revenue management; service operations; stochastic methods,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-recommendation
Overtourism in Budapest: Analysis of spatial process and suggested solutions,Remenyik B.; Barcza A.; Csapó J.; Szabó B.; Fodor G.; Dávid L.D.,2021,10.15196/RS110303,"The research aims to assess the extent of overtourism in Budapest. The analysis first introduces a system of criteria for a sustainable destination, highlighting the capacity network, institutional system, structural aspects, and architectural infrastructure load of a sustainable region. A survey of the relevant literature reveals the increasing scholarly attention paid to the phenomenon of overtourism, while singling out Budapest as one of the most affected urban areas. One potential explanation for Budapest's situation is that it developed as a result of a decreasing ability of the central districts to absorb a growing visitor load, along with a decline in the seasonal distribution of tourism. The current situation could also have emerged because the respective negative consequences were not counteracted by the inclusion of local residents. The residential segments and inhabitants were not allocated a share in the tourism-related income and, despite the steady growth in visitor numbers, they were not consulted either. The in-depth interviews with the residents of Erzsébetvâros confirm that the intensity of the irritation level indicated on the Irridex scale developed by Doxy (1975) can be divided into various stages with time. As part of the research, the authors surveyed 510 international visitors concerning tourism activities. Furthermore, the study proposes solutions to the problems related to overtourism and presents a survey of relevant recommendations by international organizations. To address overtourism, the capital requires quick decisions. Demand needs to be diversified; new sustainable tourism products need to be introduced. Visitors to Budapest should be extended in space and time, while the interest of domestic tourists in the city should be raised through strong marketing activities. Stricter regulations should be adopted for local entrepreneurs; more support should be given to contactless solutions (Jamal-Budke 2020). In the post-COVID-19 period, the overtourism is reduced and the search for close-to-nature experiences is replaced by creative tourism (Nagy et al. 2018). © 2021.

Opera participants’ perceptions of brand resonance,Hall E.; Menzies J.; Zutshi A.; Creed A.,2022,10.1111/ijcs.12743,"Brand resonance is a marketing concept under-explored in the performing arts context. This paper responds by analysing focus group findings from a large Opera group, “Big Opera[1]” (For research integrity and anonymity requirements of focus group research, the company pseudonym is Big Opera) on how decision-makers can enhance brand resonance. Opera patronage was dwindling before the COVID-19 pandemic, which was further crystallized during the pandemic. As the performing arts sector tries to revive, it is useful to understand how brand resonance concepts can be used to reinvigorate patronage at the opera. A qualitative study of four opera focus groups, which included 24 participants with varying levels of attendance was conducted to examine brand resonance. The study reveals that when customers have brand attachment and love, developed through intense experiences at the opera, facilitated by engagement with the brand, and community, then brand loyalty develops for the opera by intention to re-purchase. The paper contributes to the literature by making recommendations on how to enhance brand resonance thereby increasing attendance. Intense experiences at the opera and engagement can be enhanced by offering packaged deals, such as accommodation and dinner, or drinks and canapés packages, backstage access, the development of a social club, social media brand community and loyalty programs to increase brand loyalty. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",attendance; brand resonance; focus group; opera; performing arts,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-recommendation

Cultivating the Chinese market through destination loyalty: enhancing resilience in the Maldives,Weaver D.; Tang C.; Lawton L.; Liu Y.,2021,10.1080/14616688.2019.1623300,"Market diversification, one critical means by which tourism-dependent small island states can maintain sector resilience and destination life cycle stability, requires understanding of the destination loyalty of strategic new inbound markets such as China. An online survey of 1260 Chinese adults with previous travel experience to the Maldives identified positive proclivities with respect to revisitation and recommendation intentions as well as agreement that Chinese visitors were well catered for. Sample diversity, however, was demonstrated by cluster analysis, which revealed dominant ‘highly loyal’ (31.2%) and ‘loyal’ (37.1%) segments along with specialized clusters ambivalent about the catering (14.3%) or the revisitation intent (17.4%). Loyalty was strongly associated with older, married and higher income visitors who were aware that the Maldives is an Islamic country and who included the capital city of Male in their itinerary. Such information is invaluable for assisting target marketing and product development strategies, but situates in a context of bilateral asymmetry in which the Chinese government can destabilize small island tourism through decisions that curtail visitation by otherwise loyal residents. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; destination life cycle; destination loyalty; Small island resilience; the Maldives; 中国,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
THE POSITION OF THE BRAND AND ITS MARKETING COMMUNICATION IN THE CRISIS PERIOD,Prikrylová J.; Pátík L.,2022,,"In recent years, the world has gone through, and continues to go through, periods that no one anticipated, and on the contrary, society excluded as even possible. In 2019, COVID-19 and its global pandemic appeared. In 2022, the war in Ukraine began. The whole world and society in particular, is thus facing a completely new reality and the changes that this reality brings. More than ever, human values and psychological aspects are coming into the centre of interest and attention. Within companies and business, especially marketing and marketing communication must react and adapt to these changes and trends. Their importance is growing primarily as tools for achieving company goals. The branding phenomenon is closely linked to marketing and communication. The brand, its image, persona, values, opinions, attitudes, but also its emotional state and archetype, these are the key factors for its current success and its power. The aim of our study is to describe the current state and trends in the field of marketing and marketing communication in close connection with the brand, which is essential for the success of the company. In the next part our study focuses on the brand primarily from a psychological point of view. The theoretical part is followed by the research part, in which we analyse in detail the studies by Kantar agency, which were focused, on the one hand, on the consumers, changes in their behaviour and decision-making, and on the other hand on the brand, its position and communication in times of crisis. Our objective was to identify key factors and recommendations for these areas that are appropriate and beneficial to apply in business practice. © 2022, Communication Today.

A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test mean differences in social media behaviors prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic began. The findings demonstrated increased usage of social media as a tool for consumer decision-making.

In recent years, researchers have commonly used SNS as an instrument for linking and communicating. Homestay travel has been prevalent for a long time with the rise of social media. The goal of this study is to examine the influence of Social Network Service functions on homestay travel intention in Vietnam. Fourteen Social Network Service functions were summarized from the literature review and used as the variables influencing the purpose of homestay travel to develop a five-point Likert scale questionnaire for convenience sampling to perform an online survey. For further study, two hundred and twenty valid respondents were included. The GM(1, N) analysis showed interest sharing, photo sharing, and video sharing as the first to third most principal factors in their highly seasoned weighting towards homestay travel intention. On the other side, helping decision, helping interaction, and helping planning as the last three lists of weighting scores. Besides, multiple regression analysis shows that offering recommendations, helping planning, and sharing interest simultaneously predict homestay travel intention while the others don’t. That means consumers would heavily rely upon the functions of sharing interest of social network services to evaluate their traveling options. It is proposed that homestay traveling vendors should pay more attention to the marketing of previous travelers’ experiential interests to provoke the awareness of customers. © 2022 Institute of Information Science.

Recommendations for sustainable brand personalities: An empirical study,Paetz F.,2021,10.3390/su13094747,"Sustainability marketing has emerged as an important trend both in practice and academic literature. The relevant literature has heavily focused on determinations of sustainable consumer behavior, and practitioners have used these results to derive short-term marketing decisions, e.g., adequate pricing of sustainable products. However, no study has scrutinized derivations of sustainable brand personalities or provided important long-term, strategic, managerial implications for marketing managers of sustainable brands. This study aims to contribute to this underrepre-sented research field and makes recommendations for preferred brand personality dimensions for sustainable brands. First, the personality structure of sustainable consumers by using a preference-based two-step segmentation approach is investigated, and subsequent profiling of the sustainable consumer segment is conducted. The research relies on the results of an empirical discrete choice experiment and a personality test, including the data of a representative German consumer sample. Sustainable consumers were found to be highly agreeable and open. Second, the personality results of sustainable consumers are linked to consumers’ personality-specific preferred brand personalities. Third, recommendations for harmonic brand personality dimensions for sustainable brands, e.g., competence, excitement, and sincerity, are derived, and therefore, long-term, strategic, managerial implications are provided. © 2021 by the author.

The role of creative accounting in increasing the marketing of shares and their profits in the Iraqi stock exchange,AL-Khafaji A.A.K.; Mustangs R.F.; Alsaalim F.H.A.J.,2022,10.21533/pen.v10i2.2886,"As a result of creative accounting, many firms in the Iraqi stock market are able to achieve two very significant goals: first, to boost the market value of their shares and thus gain the biggest trading volume in shares, and second, to lower their earnings in order to decrease the tax burden. First by growing its profits, then by evading taxes and denying the state its right to its money. Using this research, we hope to demonstrate how financial institutions that use innovative accounting tools in the preparation of their financial statements impact trade activity. Trading volume is critical to accurately forecasting stock price patterns, allowing investors to maximize their wealth. So, without accounting information, the financial markets can't play their function in drawing in investment, ensuring a well-balanced use of resources, and making reasonable economic decisions, because they don't have the accounting knowledge to do so. There were four sections to the research, which included a look at the research methodology and previous studies, a look at creative accounting practices, and an analysis of the financial statements for the top and bottom ten companies in terms of trading volume using Miller's model to detect profit manipulation that occurred in those companies.

However, customers’ willingness to follow the purchase advice of the VS when there is a conflict between these recommendations and those of other online customers is less understood. This research theorizes and investigates the extent to which customers’ relationship satisfaction with, and trust in, the VS helps explain customer willingness to follow VS advice in the context of recommendation conflict. Using four studies, our research explores how and when the VS’s avatar design mitigates the negative influence of conflict. An important theoretical and managerial implication of this research is that VS avatar designs that are high in automated social presence (ASP) help reduce the negative impact of conflict. However, we find that ASP mitigates the negative effects of conflict only for avatars that score low (vs. high) on cuteness. © The Author(s) 2020.",avatar design; cuteness; relationship satisfaction; social presence; trust,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation
"May I have your attention, please? An investigation on opening effectiveness in e-mail marketing",Chaparro-Peláez J.; Hernández-García Á.; Lorente-Páramo Á.-J.,2022,10.1007/s11846-022-00517-9,"Academic research has yet to provide a comprehensive view on how to capture individuals’ attention when a promotional e-mail reaches their inbox. This study investigates the variables that influence consumers’ attention toward promotional e-mails, operationalized as open rates, and proposes an integrative model that combines and integrates visible, temporal, and contextual elements. The empirical analysis uses ordinary least squares linear regression to validate the model with data obtained from a multinational sample. The dataset, which is global in nature, comprises 5765 different promotional e-mails sent between 2013 and 2018 by different multinational companies to 455 million users located in 73 countries. The analysis provides information about the relative importance of the variables that influence individuals’ decisions to open a promotional e-mail and shows that the frequency of mailing and the use of segmentation techniques significantly affect the individual’s attention to e-mail marketing communications. The results also show a non-transparent opportunity cost associated with every e-mail sent and give advice on how to control that virtual cost. The research provides further recommendations to marketing professionals to improve the effectiveness of e-mail marketing campaigns. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.",Attention; Digital marketing; E-mail marketing; Effectiveness; Online communication; Open rate,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-recommendation
The Prevalence of Market Segmentation Research in the Tourism Industry in Africa,Visser H.,2021,10.46222/ajhtl.19770720.114,"Despite the benefits that market segmentation could provide to marketers, it is uncertain to what extend market segmentation research informs decisions about marketing strategy in the tourism industry in Africa. The purpose of this paper is to appraise the incidence of market segmentation research in this context. Market segmentation is used to demarcate a broad market into smaller segments to enable the formulation of marketing strategies based on segment needs.

While research in this context is available, recommendations are made about possible market segmentation research focus areas in the tourism industry in an African context. © 2021",African context; market segmentation; Marketing strategy; research; tourism industry,Africa Journals,scopus-recommendation
The Importance of Social Influencer-Generated Contents for User Cognition and Emotional Attachment: An Information Relevance Perspective,Zhang X.; Choi J.,2022,10.3390/su14116676,"It has become a marketing trend for marketers to use influencers to advertise and sell products because influencers can affect the attitudes and decision-making of other social media users. Most previous research on influencer marketing has concentrated on its effectiveness as a promotional tool. In contrast, there have been limited studies on the influencer-social media user relationship. The relationship that influencers have with other social media users is the foundation for the success of influencer marketing. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the factors that affect the influencers’ relationships with other users. In accordance with the concept of information relevance, this study presents a model relating the various attributes of influencer-generated content with emotional attachment and information quality to examine the relationship between influencers and other social media users. The findings of a survey of 280 respondents indicate that the interestingness, novelty, reliability, and understandability of influencer-generated content can effectively increase users’ emotional attachment to influencers. Reliability and understandability can also have a significant positive impact on information quality. This eventually inclines social media users to follow or recommend influencers to others, which can increase the popularity of influencers. This study helps researchers and marketers advance their understanding of influencers’ relationships with other social media users and offers management-related recommendations for influencers and marketers. © 2022 by the authors.

Sustainability certifications and product preference,Prell M.; Zanini M.T.; Caldieraro F.; Migueles C.,2020,10.1108/MIP-12-2019-0616,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of sustainability certifications on consumer preferences. The study investigates whether product certifications have a significant influence on consumer preferences and examines which certificate groups work best from a marketer's perspective for matching the different consumer preferences. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a quantitative survey approach, based on a conjoint analysis carried out in the Brazilian juice market. Findings: The results of 210 respondents indicate that the certifications chosen generally increase the evaluation of products. The effects, however, differ significantly between the three segments identified, especially between the two most important ones that have a combined market share of almost 90%. Our results show that demographic differences between the clusters are only marginal, as are the specific certification preferences, with a small advantage for organic certification. Research limitations/implications: The certificates chosen serve as an example that represents the various categories. The utility of similar certificates of the same category might be different. The scope of the research is also limited to the market for ready-to-drink juice. Practical implications: Using a dual targeting strategy, this study makes relevant recommendations for managing product certification. On the one hand, managers should consider a highly priced, certified product and, on the other, a low priced, uncertified product for satisfying identified demands. Decisions with regard to certification differentiation should mostly rely on the specific costs of the process because of limited consumer differentiation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on the influence that product certification has on consumer preferences by adding to the matter of certificate choice, especially from a marketer's perspective. Resolving this issue is important for facilitating the choice of those certificates that contribute most toward increasing consumer preference. Little research has been conducted into different certification groups and categories or the joint appearance of their different labels. Most of the research being carried out is aimed at the food market in developed countries, particularly in North America and Europe.

The advantages of cooperative game model in enterprises interaction in vertical marketing channels by varying small values of parameters of the advertising cost response function,Danyliuk N.; Zhemba A.; Dyma O.; Sazonets O.; Kachan O.,2020,,"Research of business interaction in marketing channels is often associated with the necessity to study the optimal business game scenarios, which provide the best implementation of enterprises business behavior strategies and maximize their profits. In such situati ons involvement of game-theoretic modeling apparatus in the process of determining key factors influencing profits formation of manufacturers and retailers, contributes to a better understanding of the cause and the effect relationships between the magnitude of profits, interpreted in the form of indicators of business strategies, and creates the prerequisites for finding ways of sharing joint profits in marketing channels. The purpose of study is to find optimal values in terms of channel members profits maximizing of the parameters of the advertising cost response function, in which the manufacturer and the retailer by agreement make decisions on the implementation of business game strategies, including pricing strategies and strategies for generating joint advertising costs. The paper presents a numerical experiment on the possible values of the parameters of the advertising cost response function, which takes into account the recommendations of the practice of enterprises functioning in distribution channels. Mathematical calculations have been made, which allow to build a model of cooperative game of the manufacturer and the retailer, based on the non-dimensional form of retail price values as well as values of joint advertising costs. The optimal solution of cooperative game, which within the numerical experiment is presented as the possible maximum values of profits of the manufacturer, the retailer and the vertical marketing channel, is made. The comparative analysis of the soluti ons of cooperative game and non-cooperative game, which involves the formation of Nash equilibrium, is given to determine the benefits of cooperative game model for both participants of the vertical marketing channel in terms of maximizing their profits and profit of the channel as a whole. The results obtained can be an information base for further calculations and comparisons of cooperative and non-cooperative models as interactions between participants of supply chains. In addition, the results of numerical simulations form the initial base for comparisons with other variants of cooperative game model, which involve changing a range and a step change of output values of the model. © 2020 IJSTR.",Advertising cost response function; Business game strategy; Cooperative game; Nash equilibrium; Profit; Retail price; Transfer price,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,scopus-recommendation
Factors affecting students in the selection of country for higher education: A comparative analysis of international students in germany and the UK,Abbas J.; Alturki U.; Habib M.; Aldraiweesh A.; Al-Rahmi W.M.,2021,10.3390/su131810065,"Based on the internationalization of higher education in the current global highly compet-itive education market, the current study aims to explore the factors affecting students in the selection of the country to continue their higher education. Following the mixed-method approach, the researchers collected data from international students studying in Germany and the United King-dom (UK). The qualitative phase identified six themes: academic, social, personal, financial, career, and marketing as the highly influential elements in students’ choice to study abroad. Empirical analyses indicate that students in both countries consider academic reputation as a dominant theme in the selection of country for HEI. However, noteworthy differences were identified in the subse-quent themes. Moreover, international students in Germany were found more satisfied with their choice of the country as compared to the students in the UK. This study provides valuable insights to the academic policymakers in the host and home countries concerning factors that pull and push students to study abroad.

YouTube It Before You Buy It: The Role of Parasocial Interaction in Consumer-to-Consumer Video Reviews,Penttinen V.; Ciuchita R.; Čaić M.,2022,10.1177/10949968221102825,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online reviews are important sources of information that help consumers decide which products and services to buy. Although C2C reviews in video format (e.g., on YouTube) have become increasingly popular, research remains focused primarily on textual reviews. This article emphasizes the importance of C2C video reviews in influencing consumer outcomes through parasocial interaction, a special—albeit one-sided—connection with reviewers. Interactivity and self-disclosure are suggested as online communication techniques reviewers can use to foster parasocial interaction with their viewers in a single encounter. Parasocial interaction is further established as a psychological mechanism that underlines the impacts of interactivity and self-disclosure on source credibility, leading to improved consumer purchase intentions. The authors also propose that strong parasocial interaction with reviewers exerts a particularly powerful influence on the purchase decisions of consumers who experience low levels of decision confidence, while arguing for the importance of C2C video reviews in guiding the decisions of various consumer groups. Research recommendations reveal how managers can encourage consumers to create and share video reviews on different platforms and offer guidance on the ways companies can foster parasocial interaction through firm-related marketing communications. © The Author(s) 2022.",C2C reviews; interactivity; parasocial interaction; self-disclosure; video reviews,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Which Products are More Responsive to In-Store Displays: Utilitarian or Hedonic?,Garrido-Morgado Á.; González-Benito Ó.; Martos-Partal M.; Campo K.,2021,10.1016/j.jretai.2020.10.005,"In-store displays aim to boost sales of both utilitarian and hedonic products. Noting typical differences in the information processing and purchase behavior evoked by these product types, and building on congruency theory principles, the authors propose that different types of in-store displays (i.e., island, end-of-aisle, or shelf signage) are more appropriate for utilitarian versus hedonic products, and the use of price or product promotions might reinforce these effects. With a database that combines three data sources (scanner, observational, and survey), this article presents an analysis of a market share model at the SKU level. The results confirm that in-store displays have differential effects on sales, depending on their characteristics; congruency between the decision-making process of utilitarian versus hedonic products and the characteristics of in-store display types moderates their effectiveness in terms of SKU sales. Shelf signage strongly increases the sales of utilitarian products, whereas island and end-of-aisle displays increase sales of hedonic product categories more effectively. The use of congruent promotions creates synergistic influences that reinforce these effects. In particular, price promotions improve the impact of shelf signage on utilitarian products, and product promotions strengthen the impacts of island and end-of-aisle displays on hedonic products. These results extend prior research on in-store marketing actions and the nature of utilitarian versus hedonic products, as well as providing recommendations for retailers and manufacturers seeking to optimize their retail space and commercial budgets. © 2020 New York University",Congruency principle; Dual information processing mode; Hedonic product; In-store display; Utilitarian product,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Unpacking the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and coopetition-oriented behaviours,Crick J.M.,2021,10.1108/JBIM-03-2020-0165,"Purpose: Earlier work has suggested that assumptions, values and beliefs about the importance of cooperating with competitors (a coopetition-oriented mindset) should manifest into behavioural forms of coopetition, such as resource and capability-sharing activities. Yet, limited research surrounds the complexities of this link. The purpose of this study is to unpack the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and coopetition-oriented behaviours under the moderating roles of industry experience and degree of internationalization, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view. Design/methodology/approach: The chosen empirical context was the Canadian wine industry because wine producers are often involved in coopetition strategies and have varying degrees of internationalisation. Preliminary interview data were collected from 18 managers to shape the operationalisations. Then survey data were collected from 195 Canadian wine producers. After checking the statistical data for all major assessments of reliability and validity (together with common method variance), the hypothesised and control paths were tested through hierarchical regression. Findings: A coopetition-oriented mindset had a positive and significant association with coopetition-oriented behaviours. Surprisingly, this link was negatively moderated by industry experience. Additionally, degree of internationalisation yielded a positive moderation effect. These moderators highlight situations where a coopetition-oriented mindset is (and is not) likely to manifest into coopetition activities. Practical implications: If firms aim to engage in behavioural forms of coopetition, they should manage assumptions, values and beliefs associated with the advantages of collaborating with their competitors. Industry experience can limit the extent to which business’ coopetition-oriented mindsets manifest into coopetition-oriented behaviours. This could be explained by decision makers possessing information that discourages them from working with certain (untrustworthy) rivals because of the potential harmful effects on their performance. Companies should use their industry experience to avoid working with rival entities that will create negative outcomes, such as tensions (e.g., conflict, power imbalances and opportunistic behaviours), lost intellectual property and diluted competitive advantages. Nonetheless, industry experience might signify that there are more risks than rewards linked with these business-to-business marketing strategies. Higher levels of internationalisation can help firms to recognise that coopetition-oriented behaviours may lead to performance-enhancing opportunities in their overseas markets. Originality/value: This investigation contributes to the business-to-business marketing literature with new evidence on how organisations can foster a coopetition-oriented mindset to engage in coopetition strategies. The negative moderation effect from industry experience highlights that knowledge of competitors’ activities can limit the extent to which coopetition-oriented behaviours are implemented. Moreover, the positive interaction effect from degree of internationalisation extends the growing body of knowledge pertaining to coopetition in an international arena. Collectively, these results show that while a coopetition-oriented mindset is a critical driver of coopetition-oriented behaviours, there are certain contingencies that can strengthen or weaken this association. Finally, by integrating resource-based theory and the relational view, this paper could explore the different forms of coopetition, in terms of organisation-wide mindsets and firm-level behaviours. This paper concludes with some managerial recommendations, alongside a series of limitations and avenues for future research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Coopetition-oriented behaviours; Coopetition-oriented mindsets; Degree of internationalisation; Industry experience; Relational view; Resource-based theory,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
The impact of Danmu technological features on consumer loyalty intention toward recommendation vlogs: a perspective from social presence and immersion,Yang T.; Yang F.; Men J.,2022,10.1108/ITP-01-2021-0008,"Purpose: This study investigates how Danmu (danmaku) technological features (DTFs) of recommendation vlogs (rec-vlogs) impact consumer experiences and decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique with a sample of 422 viewers of Danmu-enabled rec-vlogs to examine the proposed model. Findings: The DTFs positively affect consumer loyalty intentions through the mediation of social presence and immersion. Also, vlogger-product congruency significantly moderates the relationship between social presence and immersion. Originality/value: With the increasing popularity of vlogs, retailers have adopted the vlog as a new marketing channel to connect with consumers. Although a growing body of studies focuses on this phenomenon, little is known about how DTFs help to increase consumer loyalty toward using rec-vlogs as product information sources. Anchored on the stimulus–organism–response framework, this study investigates how pseudo-synchronicity, Danmu-content congruency and parallelism, three DTFs used in rec-vlogs, impact consumer experiences of social presence and immersion, eventually influence the consumers' loyalty intentions toward rec-vlogs. The authors also examine whether the effect of social presence on immersion is contingent on vlogger-product congruency. These findings have implications for both researchers and practitioners to understand the effect of DTFs in the context of rec-vlogs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Danmu technological features; Immersion; Loyalty intention; Recommendation vlog; Social presence; S–O–R framework; Vlogger-product congruency,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Information behaviour in high risk decision making: Study of international postgraduates,McNicholas C.; Marcella R.,2022,10.1177/01655515221124080,"This article explores the role of information in high risk consumer decision making. Forty-two qualitative interviews were undertaken with international non-EU postgraduates when making the high risk decision to study in a UK Business School. Prospective international postgraduates moved iteratively through the stages in Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process model and learnt from the search process they had undertaken in a continuous cyclical manner. Word-of-mouth recommendations were the most influential sources of information gathered, and online sources were perceived to be credible regardless of their origins. The perception of risk impacted the rigour of the information search process. An iterative decision making cycle model is proposed with Kuhlthau’s model and word of mouth information at its core, which reflects the connectedness of individuals in this digital era.

Market access for medicines treating rare diseases: Association between specialised processes for orphan medicines and funding recommendations,Fontrier A.-M.,2022,10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115119,"Access to medicines treating rare diseases (‘orphan medicines’) has proven challenging due to high prices and clinical uncertainty. To optimise market access to these medicines, some healthcare systems are implementing specialised pathways and/or processes during marketing authorisation (MA) and/or health technology assessment (HTA). Comparing one setting where these medicines are classed as “orphan” (Scotland) to another where they considered “non-orphan” (Canada), this study aims to explore whether the presence of specialised pathways and processes at MA and HTA levels is associated with more favourable funding recommendations and faster time to market access. A matched sample of 116 medicine-indication pairs with MA approval from 2001 to 2019 in Europe and Canada was identified, and publicly available sources were used for data extraction. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. All medicines were commercially marketed in both countries, except one instance in Scotland. In Scotland, more orphan medicines (68.1%) had a favourable HTA recommendation than in Canada (60.4%), while Canada issued more negative HTA recommendations (20.7%) than Scotland (15.5%). Low levels of agreement on HTA recommendations and the main reasons driving recommendations were found between settings. In both countries, medicines with specialised MA approval were less likely to receive negative HTA recommendations than medicines with standard MA. Time to market access was faster in Canada than Scotland, though medicines with specialised MA approval had slower timelines than medicines with standard MA approval in both countries. However, it is unclear whether the presence of orphan designation and HTA specialised processes alone could result in favourable funding recommendations without accounting for other healthcare system-related factors and differences in the decision-making processes across settings. Holistic approaches and better alignment of evidentiary requirements across regulators are needed to optimise access to orphan medicines. © 2022",Access; Health technology assessment; HTA; Marketing authorisation; Orphan medicines; Rare diseases; Specialised pathways; Specialised processes,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Experiential Marketing as a Mechanism to Deliver Value for Mobile Network Operators,Yiadom M.B.; Tait M.,2022,10.31920/1750-4562/2022/V17N3A5,"Experiential marketing is being considered by researchers and marketers as an alternative solution to traditional marketing for achieving the best results for organisational lifetime value. However, network operators are preoccupied with traditional marketing programmes and strategies, which have produced limited results (value). This study sought to utilise experiential marketing as a tool to create value for mobile network operators, as well as provide recommendations to avoid future gaps. This study utilised a positivistic paradigm and a quantitative approach through a self-administered, structured hard copy questionnaire for data collection. Stratification and convenience sampling techniques were used to select participants from each of the regional offices of the network operators in Ghana. The database of the national communication authority (NCA) of Ghana was accessed to identify the number of registered operators and the associated subscribed customers in the country. A total of 415 customers responded to the survey. The study concluded that experiential marketing had a positive and sustainable influence on value (business value). It is envisaged that this study could assist network operators and other businesses to create value by understanding the factors influencing experiential marketing, thereby assisting in the formulation of effective and efficient strategies and decisions. Furthermore, this study offers practical recommendations that could strengthen businesses when establishing experiential marketing programmes.

New digital tourism ecosystem: understanding the relationship between information sources and sharing economy platforms,Almeida-Santana A.; David-Negre T.; Moreno-Gil S.,2020,10.1108/IJTC-09-2019-0173,"Purpose: The purpose of this study resides in a better understanding of the relationship between the use of traditional operators, online travel agencies, such as Booking.com and Expedia, comparators, tour operators and traditional travel agencies, airlines, new non-tourist companies like Google and the use of sharing economy platforms to obtain information about a travel destination. Design/methodology/approach: Applying an analysis to 13,243 tourists from 19 European countries, a binomial logit analysis was carried out with the latest version of the SPSS statistical analysis program. Findings: The use of Expedia and Booking.com has a positive effect on the use of sharing economy platforms to obtain information about travel destinations. However, it can also be observed how the use of Google, Facebook, tour operators and travel agencies, airlines and Twitter can have a negative effect. Practical implications: The study provides interesting recommendations for destinations to be able to design better marketing strategies which focus on cognitive components of the destination image in different information sources. Originality/value: Tourists search for information that helps them make better decisions when it comes to choosing a travel destination and they do so using different channels that have evolved over time. The proliferation of internet platforms has transformed the way tourists search for information and consequently the way the secondary image of destination is formed. The sharing economy plays an important role in this new tourism ecosystem. These new business models, based on platforms, coexist with other traditional information sources, tour operators and travel agencies and airlines. However, previous studies have not inquired about the relationship between them all. © 2020, International Tourism Studies Association.",Destination choice; Information sources; Sharing economy; Social media; Tourist behaviour,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
An Exploration of Decision-Making under Threat,Bourguignon B.; Boeck H.; Clarke T.B.,2020,10.1080/1051712X.2020.1831210,"Purpose: The use of threats to force supplier compliance is a common practice in current business affairs. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the supplier’s decision process to comply to or resist such a coercive strategy. The paper aims to develop a more comprehensive view of the decision process used by suppliers when threatened by their customers, as well as discover new phenomena regarding supplier Decision-Making Under Threat (DUT). More specifically, it aims at (1) gaining a better understanding of threats by looking at their patterns and commonalities and (2) identifying which consideration factors are relevant when suppliers evaluate threats. Method: To identify which consideration factors are relevant to suppliers when deciding how to react to threats, the study employed an exploratory approach by interviewing 17 marketing practitioners with experiences in DUT. The in-depth interviews lasted between thirty-five and sixty-five minutes and were transcribed. Descriptive coding and template analysis generated thirty-nine descriptors and nine categories that are deemed important when considering DUT. The authors also evaluated the intensity of each of the consideration factors present in the decision process. Findings: The results reveal that it is possible to categorize threats into three components: Objectives, Penalties and Manifestations. Objectives are what the customer is trying to achieve by using the threat, namely demanding price reductions, appropriating intellectual property, procuring financial statements, receiving a bribe, increasing technical requirements, accessing a cost breakdown, modifying delivery terms, and modifying payment terms. The penalty is what the supplier can expect to happen when refusing to comply, such as losing the customer’s sales. Finally, manifestations describe how the threat is presented by the customer. Study results show that these manifestations may be categorized according to their level of ambiguity, predictability, and candor. The results also reveal that at least five cognitive decision criteria are typically considered during the decision process although at different intensity levels from each participant. These criteria include: Dependence, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Relationship Quality, Relational Norm Violations, and Mimetic Isomorphism. Several interesting discoveries were made. For example, Dependence is both the consideration factor for which most people emphasized its influence on their decision and for which most people said that it had no influence at all. Relational norm violations is unique by being the only criterion for which no participant mentioned that it does not influence their decision. The overwhelming majority of study participants considered more than three criteria during the DUT process. Finally, participants said that they experienced negative emotions such as anger and frustration when exposed to threats albeit most did not recognize that it played a role in their decision. These emotions are however believed to be a factor in reducing the supplier’s willingness to comply. Overall, the study finds that DUT is a complex decision process regarding supplier adaptation, and can be a highly emotional experience with long-lasting effects. Research implications: The face-to-face interviews used to collect narratives of participants being exposed to customer threats is deemed an appropriate and highly recommendable methodological approach. When collecting data on reactions to threats and their accompanying emotional reaction several non-verbal signs that the participants physically demonstrated were an essential component in fully interpreting the data. As such, future research on the topic could include video recordings of the interviews. The narratives were also very efficient in recalling the emotions associated with the coercive event though the interviews sometimes occurred several years afterward. The participants’ opinions are consistent with academia’s view regarding the ambiguous role of emotions during decision-making. On the one hand, emotions are recognized to play an important role, they should be acknowledged and understood, while on the other hand, many believe that emotions should not contaminate the decision process. By combining five cognitive criteria with emotions in a DUT framework, the paper incorporates knowledge from the field of psychology into the business-to-business marketing literature. The article highlights the fact that the study of both threats in a business setting and the role of emotions in decision-making are neglected topics that deserve more academic attention. Practical implications: From the customer’s perspective an improved understanding of the supplier’s DUT may help customers limit the damage to relationships when using coercive influence strategies such as threats. From the supplier’s perspective, the results emphasize the importance to decompose their customer’s threat in order to better respond to its use. By also taking into account all consideration factors suppliers can take better quality decisions. The results provide several recommendations such as to include intangibles in the cost-benefit analysis instead of solely focusing on the short-term financial impact. Emotional control has been stressed by the participants as a key managerial ability to master when faced with threats. Originality/value/contribution: By merging the influence strategy research stream and the supplier adaptation research stream together, the study generates a few original and noteworthy contributions. A better understanding of threats is garnered by breaking them down into three components, which consequently extends our understanding of influence strategies. The study also contributes to a deeper understanding of the supplier’s DUT, a new concept described in the paper, by identifying how decision makers include multiple criteria in their decision process. Very few academic papers have specifically looked into threats as a coercive strategy despite its prevalent use in business environments. Those that did focused on a limited set of criteria when analyzing the decision to adapt. The article expands on these previous studies by proposing five decision criteria, which are often considered collectively by participants when examining adaptation under threat, and emphasizes a factor neglected in previous research, namely the role of emotions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",buyer-seller relationships; decision process; emotions; influence strategies; Threats,Routledge,scopus-recommendation

Analysis of FDA's IQOS marketing authorisation and its policy impacts,Lempert L.K.; Glantz S.,2021,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055585,"Background Philip Morris Products SA (PMPSA) submitted a premarket tobacco application (PMTA) to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking an order permitting it to market IQOS in the USA. US law requires FDA to deny marketing authorisation if applicants fail to demonstrate that their product is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. FDA issued a marketing order for IQOS in April 2019, which Philip Morris is using to promote IQOS outside the USA. Methods We analysed FDA's Technical Project Lead Review and marketing order for IQOS, relevant law and guidance on PMTAs and independent research on the health impacts of IQOS. Results FDA found that the evidence PMPSA submitted did not demonstrate reduction in long-term disease risks and that IQOS aerosol emits toxins with carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, some at higher levels than conventional cigarettes. PMPSA did not appropriately consider the health impacts of dual use, the product's attractiveness to youth or data showing that consumers do not accurately perceive the addiction risks of IQOS. Despite FDA's own scientists' recommendations and independent research showing that IQOS presents serious risks to users including cytotoxic, genotoxic, hepatotoxic, cardiovascular and pulmonary risks, FDA concluded that IQOS is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. Conclusion FDA's decision allowing IQOS to be marketed in the USA disregarded valid scientific evidence and misapplied the public health standard mandated by law. This decision may have important health impacts, influence marketing IQOS outside the USA and erode public confidence in FDA's future PMTA decisions.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF CONSUMER CHOICE. AN EVALUATION OF THE STRATEGY OF PRICING AND ADVERTISING,Kot M.,2022,10.37190/ord220104,"The authors develop an agent-based model of the market where firms and consumers exchange products. Consumers in the model are heterogeneous in terms of features, such as risk-aversion or owned assets, which impact their individual decisions. Consumers constantly learn about products' features through personal experience, word-of-mouth, or advertising, update their expectations and share their opinions with others. From the supply-side of the model, firms can influence consumers with two marketing tools: advertising and pricing policy. Series of experiments have been conducted with the model to investigate the relationship between advertising and pricing and to understand the underlying mechanism. Marketing strategies have been evaluated in terms of generated profit and recommendations have been formulated. © 2022 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Journal of Clinical Imaging Science",agent-based model; consumer choice; learning consumers,Wroclaw University of Science and Technology,scopus-recommendation

Role of packaging in consumer buying behavior,Alhamdi F.M.,2020,10.5267/j.msl.2019.11.040,"Every year about 95% of new products fail for a simple reason that most customers do not have the time or energy to think about the advantages or disadvantages of the products they place in their shopping carts, so they rely on shortcuts to make a purchase decision such as quality, beauty and excellence of product packaging. Packaging becomes part and parcel of our contemporary life especially in the continuous development for the conception of marketing. It becomes one of the basic dimensions for the concept of production because it plays big role to emphasize the mental image of the product on the consumer’s side. The importance of packaging leads several of marketing thinkers to consider it as enclosed marketing mix elements and one of corner stone in which goods depend on its success process. Therefore, the current study aims to study the concept and the importance of packaging and its role in attracting the consumer’s attention, and to determine the difficulties that the companies undergo in the field of packaging. The study depends on assembling the primary data on questionnaire designed especially for this purpose, and distributed to 600 consumers in Riyadh city. In addition to that secondary data is collected from resources related to the study subject. Simple statistical analysis is used to analyze the data. The results of research confirm the big role for the packaging in consumer attraction in study sample with all dimensions (design, color, size, and shape). The most important recommendation of the study is that to adopt a clear policy for packing in industrial organizations that cope with high technological development and the fast changing in consumer's tastes. It must be taken into the consideration the modern marketing orientations in product's packaging including the green marketing that depends on using material that has a little environmental effect at packaging process compared with traditional methods. © 2020 by the authors.",Consumer attention; Cover color; Cover design; Packaging,Growing Science,scopus-recommendation

The report provides five recommendations to AACP and twelve suggestions for colleges and schools of pharmacy. The committee focused on the need to develop tailored leadership training and mentoring programs for admissions personnel on relevant topics, including change management, holistic thinking, leadership, problem solving, technical knowledge, professional development, paths for promotion, conflict resolution, networking, persuasive communication, and strategic planning. Rather than develop new resources, the committee identified existing professional competencies and assessment resources developed by other organizations for student affairs and admissions personnel that could spur enhanced strategic marketing and professional development opportunities in pharmacy education. It also reaffirmed the need for student diversity and the use of data to drive strategic decisions in recruitment. To identify gaps in knowledge among AACP member institutions, the committee analyzed the results of its fall 2018 survey on the current depth and breadth of student recruitment activities and their perceived effectiveness. The committee also recommended ways institutions can encourage faculty and others outside of the admissions office to participate in student recruitment activities. Finally, the committee concluded that it will be necessary for colleges and schools to collaborate across the academy to promote the benefits of pharmacy profession to prospective students, rather than individual colleges and schools of pharmacy, and be more responsive to the expectations of Gen Z students before the tide in applications will shift in a positive direction. © 2019, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

Patient empowerment: A cross-disease exploration of antecedents and consequences,Prigge J.-K.; Dietz B.; Homburg C.; Hoyer W.D.; Burton J.L.,2015,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.05.009,"Emphasized by the World Health Organization as one of its key topics, patient empowerment (PE)-i.e., the set of self-determined behaviors based on patients' individual needs for developing autonomy and competence with their disease-is today regarded as a key component of a patient-centered approach to healthcare. Unfortunately, research lacks a clear understanding of the drivers of PE, its relationship to therapy compliance, and its role in different types of diseases. Using a large sample of 1622 patients suffering from chronic diseases, this study addresses these critical research gaps and provides three major contributions. First, by exploring the influence of PE antecedents (i.e., patients' health involvement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of physician authority), it provides specific recommendations on how to effectively manage PE (defined in terms of three dimensions: information search, knowledge development, and decision participation). Second, it demonstrates the importance of PE and its antecedents for affecting patients' therapy compliance and shows that, depending on the PE dimension, therapy compliance is either enhanced or reduced. By highlighting the ambiguous role of PE in therapy compliance, the study offers specific suggestions for healthcare stakeholders on how to maximize patients' compliance to recommended therapies. Third, the study provides important insights into the role of PE across different types of chronic diseases, offering practical recommendations on how to deal with patients depending on their particular disease. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Healthcare marketing; Patient behavior; Patient empowerment; Therapy compliance,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation
Do social networking platforms promote service quality and purchase intention of customers of service-providing organizations?,Naeem M.,2019,10.1108/JMD-11-2018-0327,"Purpose: Customers are interested in finding service recommendations, reviews and word of mouth using social networking platforms. These service reviews are useful for enhancing service quality, level of information and engagement, and purchase intention of customers. The purpose of this paper is to uncover which social networking platform is more useful for the exchange of service reviews and how organizations are improving purchase intention as well as service quality in the light of customer’s reviews/experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The study is exploratory in nature because it aims to understand the use of social networking platforms for enhancing service quality and the purchase intention of customers using a purposive sampling technique. To meet the objective of this study, non-directive and semi-structured interviews have been conducted with customers and marketing teams in the banking sector and internet service providers. Findings: The results show that social networking websites are helpful in fostering responsiveness, awareness, assurance, reliability and empathy. However, respondents revealed serious concerns regarding the privacy of personal and financial information especially in the context of the banking sector. It has been found that official Facebook pages of service-providing organizations, open and closed local community Facebook groups, sponsored ads and promotional advertisements on Facebook, WhatsApp groups and YouTube video comments are more frequently used to exchange service reviews (i.e. influence the process of purchase decision) among friends, friends of friends, family members and the general public. The selected customers and market team respondents revealed that local community Facebook groups (i.e. open groups and closed groups) have gained prime importance for enhancing service quality and purchase decisions. Practical implications: The effective and well-organized use of social networking platforms can foster service reviews, word of mouth, level of service awareness, interactive communication, intention to purchase, social influence, social trust and services quality. Furthermore, online social networking platforms require a lower level of advertisement costs and offer huge amounts of information, discussions, enquires, service stories, word of mouth, transactions and interactions of consumers. Originality/value: The present study is exploratory in nature because it selects an under-researched issue regarding the use of social networking applications to enhance levels of purchase intention and service quality. There is limited literature which has combined the multiple constructs in a single study (i.e. social media platforms, cross-platform platforms, service quality and purchase intention of consumers). Most of the previous studies are dependent on various dimensions of service quality (i.e. “reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empath and tangibles”). However, the present study extracted that respondents have given more preferences of services awareness and privacy compared to traditional elements of service quality. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Purchase intention of customers; Service sector; Services quality; Social networking applications,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Social advertisements for public health and epidemic dynamics: A study based on HIV/AIDS prevention television advertisements in four European countries,Casais B.; Proença J.F.,2018,10.1108/JSOCM-07-2014-0049,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine health-related social advertisements to identify its use and evaluate its appropriateness to situational needs, such as epidemic dynamics and the context where it is implemented. The paper also discusses the barriers that policymakers face in creating these linkages. Design/methodology/approach: In all, 375 national HIV/AIDS prevention television advertisements from France, Germany, Portugal and Italy were viewed and analyzed over time of production, exploring the sources, the target audiences and the messages delivered. This paper compares management choices with HIV epidemics in each country and their contextual profiles. Findings: The findings of this paper indicate that social advertising concerned with HIV/AIDS prevention is commonly framed within public policies and does not usually target the most vulnerable and affected populations. Furthermore, social ads are reactive to epidemic dynamics. The existence of trade-offs between putting forward theoretical marketing recommendations and taking account of contextual fracturing issues or increasing stigma and discrimination are also considered. Research limitations/implications: This paper is useful for public sector management because of the importance of evaluating the investments done to improve future strategies. The discussion about restrictions and concerns for policy-makers is important to improve management decisions. Originality/value: This paper suggests the adoption of proactive public policies and proposes strategies to overcome the restrictions or concerns faced by policy-makers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Advertising; Behavior/Attitudes; Health promotion; Public health,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

Assessing fertilizer buying behavior of emerging farmers in a south african grain producing area,Lotriet R.; Bisschoff C.; Kole A.,2017,10.21511/ppm.15(2-2).2017.14,"Fertilizer not only plays a major role in the profitability of the farmer's business, but also represents an expensive farm input. The emerging farmer market segment is expanding and holds a great deal of potential for fertilizer companies to supply the growing need for fertilizer in this market. Almost all fertilizer marketing strategies of South African companies have been designed to cater for the commercial farming sector; however, if fertilizer suppliers want to focus on the emerging farmer market segment, they need to understand buying behavior of emerging farmers, as well as their needs when developing strategies to utilize opportunities in this developing market. This study aims to identify factors playing an important role in the buying behavior of emerging farmers in the Free State when purchasing fertilizer. The results show that service, brand, product, and learning or psychological factors highly influence emerging farmers' fertilizer purchase decision. The study also finally draws recommendations and conclusions for managerial perusal. © Ronald Lotrie, Christo Bisschof, Aron Kole, 2017.",Emerging farmers; Fertilizer; Free State; Purchase decision; South Africa,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,scopus-recommendation
Targeted advertising in public transportation systems with quantitative evaluation,Zhang D.; Guo L.; Nie L.; Shao J.; Wu S.; Shen H.T.,2017,10.1145/3003725,"In spite of vast business potential, targeted advertising in public transportation systems is a grossly unexplored research area. For instance, SBS Transit in Singapore can reach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than $35 million. To bridge the gap, we propose a probabilistic data model that captures the motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an advertisement among the passengers. In particular, we leverage hundreds of millions of bus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as the extent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model, we study a top-k retrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation, which acts as a primitive operator to support various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to support real-Time decision making. In the experimental study, we use the dataset from SBS Transit as a case study to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies. © 2017 ACM.",Mobility pattern; Probabilistic data model; Public transportation systems; Quantitative evaluation; Targeted advertising; User interest,Association for Computing Machinery,scopus-recommendation
Examining the effects of online social relations on product ratings and adoption: Evidence from an online social networking and rating site,He X.; Karami A.; Deng C.,2017,10.1504/IJWBC.2017.086591,"Social relationships have long been recognised for their role in shaping consumers' opinions and decisions in the traditional offline world. While the number of people participating in online activities and purchases is continuously growing, there is a lack of understanding on whether and how explicitly established social connections might affect product evaluation and adoption in an online environment. Yet, online social relations are notably distinct from their offline counterparts. In this study, using a dataset collected from an online social networking and rating site, we conduct a comparative event analysis around the establishment of online social connections. Our findings provide supporting evidence that explicit online social relations positively influence users' product ratings and play a significant role in expanding a user's product adoption into new product categories over time, which offers important implications for product marketing strategies and design of online recommendation systems.

The effect of perceived brand leadership on luxury service WOM,Chang Y.; Ko Y.J.; Leite W.L.,2016,10.1108/JSM-01-2015-0005,"Purpose: Despite the remarkable growth of the luxury industry, a phenomenon referred to as luxury fever, as well as the growing interest in word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing in the industry at hand, little is known about how consumers’ perceived leadership of luxury brands dynamically influences their WOM behavior. This paper aims to examine the moderating role of a type of luxuries (accessible vs inaccessible) in the relationship between the four dimensions of perceived brand leadership – quality, value, innovativeness and popularity – and consumers’ WOM recommendation intention. Design/methodology/approach: The current research is based on survey data gathered from 333 actual customers who attend five golf clubs located in North Florida. An innovative data analysis procedure that combines structural equation modeling with propensity score analysis to estimate the moderating effects, controlling for selection bias, is presented. Findings: Quality was the significant predictor of WOM among consumers of inaccessible luxuries (private club). In contrast, financial value and popularity were key factors in predicting WOM of individuals who chose accessible luxuries (public club). Originality/value: This paper attempts to shed new light on the field of strategic luxury marketing by addressing differential consumption decision-making processes corresponding to hierarchically constructed luxury services. In addition, an innovative way is suggested to achieve covariates’ balance in the examinations of latent variables and multisampling models for observational research. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Brand leadership; Luxury products; Propensity score analysis; Selection bias; Word-of-mouth recommendation,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

How much do online consumers really value free product returns? Evidence from eBay,Shang G.; Pekgün P.; Ferguson M.; Galbreth M.,2017,10.1016/j.jom.2017.07.001,"Consumer return rates have been steadily rising in recent years, resulting in growing costs for retailers who must manage the returns process and the disposition of returned products. This cost pressure is driven in part by extremely generous return policies, such as giving consumers a full refund upon return. Interestingly, this common retail practice of full refunds is inconsistent with the recommendations of many analytical models of returns, which nearly always show that a partial refund is optimal. Such inconsistencies between theory and practice might arise when the decision drivers included in the analytical models do not match the decision drivers in practice. It might also be the case that retailers are overly optimistic about the value that consumers assign to a full refund, and thus assume that the value of such a policy outweighs its costs. In this paper, we use data collected from eBay, where identical products are sold with different return policies, to investigate these open questions in the literature. We analyze both the return policy drivers from the retailer's perspective and the return policy value from the consumer's perspective. Our results suggest that the value of a full refund policy to consumers may not be as large as one might expect, and it also exhibits a large heterogeneity across buyers with different levels of online purchase experience. In addition, we provide empirical evidence for what has long been suspected by online retailers – that a non-refundable forward shipping charge quickly erodes any value that consumers assign to return policies. The generality of our results is limited by the fact that eBay differs from traditional retail contexts in many respects, including the fact that eBay buyers may not be representative of the general buyer population. However, our study of how eBay consumers value free returns provides new insights into an understudied area, and it can serve as a starting point for future studies of the value of return policies in other retail contexts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer returns; eBay; Marketing-operations interface; Online retailing,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation
The Value of Customer References to Potential Customers in Business Markets,Morgado A.V.,2018,10.1177/2394964318771799,"The literature on referencing takes a firm stance on the value that vendors derive from marketing customer references. What the literature lacks, however, is empirical work that supports our current understanding of the value of customer references to the potential customer. The present exploratory research aims to demonstrate the value of customer references from the perspective of the potential customer. This goal will be achieved by considering a single case study that provides evidence for the value of customer references to potential customers in business markets. Three theoretical propositions emerge as key conceptual contributions: (a) customer references allow buying companies to establish their suppliers’ competence, assess the buying decision risk and forecast return on investment; (b) customer references deliver value by helping potential customers to identify new business needs and (c) potential customers benefit from being exposed to customer references insofar as they are sources of organizational learning. This work concludes by presenting recommendations for practitioners who wish to reap the full benefits of customer references. © 2018 SAGE Publications.",B2B marketing; case study; customer references; energy industry; value creation,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation

The problem of research has identified the main question of the current study, which is ‘What role does the brand image of the brand play in the customer's purchase decision?’ For the purposes of achieving the study objectives, a sample of hypotheses has been formulated. In order to verify the validity of the main hypothesis, several tests were carried out. The researcher used the questionnaire as a means of obtaining data. The study used the analytical descriptive approach as a method of analysis, which is composed of two measures: brand image and purchase involvement.

Recommendation influence: Differential neural responses of consumers during shopping online,Guo F.; Zhang X.; Ding Y.; Wang X.,2016,10.1037/npe0000051,"In diverse social environments, recommendations from others have the power to change consumer behavior. In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from highfamiliarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",Event-related potentials; Neural responses; Propensity; Recommendation; Value measurement,American Psychological Association Inc.,scopus-recommendation

Businesses and mobile social media capability,Bolat E.; Kooli K.; Wright L.T.,2016,10.1108/JBIM-10-2016-270,"Purpose: Mobile social media (MSM), an interaction, exchange of information and creation of user-generated content, mediated by mobile devices, is becoming the locomotive that drives forward evolution of the online world. Fewer academic studies have touched upon the MSM subject, with all the papers being of a conceptual nature to provide recommendations to business-to-business (B2B) firms. This paper aims to explore how B2B firms use MSM in reality. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts the grounded theory approach to analyse interviews conducted in 26 B2B firms representing the UK advertising and marketing sector. Interviewees represent key decision-makers who understand the aspects of mobile technology use in their firms. Eighteen firms stressed the importance of social media as a trigger to adopt mobile devices. Follow-up data collection in these 18 firms focus on strategic orientation, processes, routines and skills required for using MSM. Findings: This paper found that marketing and advertising firms use MSM for branding, sensing market, managing relationships and developing content. MSM is treated by businesses as a strategic firm-specific capability that drives firms’ competitiveness, where imitation of such capability by competitors is limited because MSM skills are specific to individuals within organisations and MSM routines are manifested as a result of firm-specific MSM skills’ interactions. Originality/value: This study is amongst the first to provide insights into B2B firms’ practices of using MSM. Additionally, the research is novel because it discovers that MSM capability is developed as a result of the overlap between individuals’ and organisational knowledge and memory, contradicting existing theory on the subject. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Capability approach; Grounded theory; Mobile technology; Social media,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
How important is the strategic order of product attribute presentation in the non-life insurance market?,Dominique-Ferreira S.,2017,10.1016/j.jretconser.2016.09.013,"Sales management plays an important role in firms' profit. Its main goal is to determine the best time to present insurance customers with prices, insurers, bundling strategies, and the intermediary's recommendation. In this study, a triangular approach was used. For attribute selection, three focus groups were performed with insurance customers and intermediaries. Conjoint analysis was carried out by presenting the attributes in three different orders. Primacy and recency effects were detected; a transfer or anchor effect was also found related to the importance of the attributes preceding and succeeding a given attribute. According to the findings, salespeople can improve their approach to customers by decreasing the importance given to price and increasing the positive impact of bundling strategies and the intermediary's recommendation in sales. Although the order of attribute presentation has previously been analyzed, this is the first study to examine this issue in non-life insurance products, providing useful information to insurance salespeople and marketing managers for a better understanding of insurance customers’ buying decision process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Bundling strategy; Customer services management; Effects of the order of attribute presentation; Insurance sector; Sales management,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Toward a model of sparkling wine purchasing preferences,Verdonk N.; Wilkinson J.; Culbert J.; Ristic R.; Pearce K.; Wilkinson K.,2017,10.1108/IJWBR-10-2015-0048,"Purpose: This paper aims to provide further insight into factors influencing Australian consumers’ purchasing preferences for sparkling wine, including champagne. Design/methodology/approach: Focus groups were conducted and thematic analysis was undertaken to identify factors influencing sparkling wine consumers’ purchasing preferences. Findings: Personal taste was found to influence choice of a sparkling wine rather than another type of beverage, and selection of a particular style and brand of sparkling wine. Country or region of origin was found to be important, often linked to the product being champagne. Brand image, reputation and symbolism were found to influence purchase decisions (sometimes linked to consumption occasion), especially for purchases of gifts. Advice, recommendations and expert reviews, and consumption occasion also were found to influence purchase decisions. Price was found to influence style and brand of sparkling wine purchased. A high price was found to be a barrier for some participants, while other participants were found to avoid sparkling wines priced below some particular level. Thematic analysis enabled development of a preliminary model of purchasing preferences. Research limitations/implications: Being exploratory in nature, findings cannot be generalised. Further studies are required to confirm the preliminary model and to evaluate the validity and significance of proposed relationships. Practical implications: Findings suggest a producer could benefit from marketing a range of sparkling wines to cater to different tastes, occasions and gift purchases. Findings also confirm the importance of marketers pursuing opportunities to obtain and promote favourable expert reviews for their sparkling wines, and of identifying and promoting regional distinctiveness. Originality/value: The first comprehensive model of sparkling wine consumers’ purchasing preferences has been developed.

Interdisciplinary projects utilizing best practice in conservation psychology, community-based social marketing, and conservation marketing are likely to lead to improved outcomes, such as reductions in human consumption patterns and other unsustainable behaviors and increases in community engagement. A closer relationship between conservation psychology and conservation marketing will lead to publications of research in high-impact peer-reviewed journals, offering practical recommendations for conservation practitioners, as well as reaching laypeople. Importantly, communicating successes and failures of different approaches, projects or campaigns will help conservation practitioners, conservation educators, tourism operators, community groups, policy-makers, and other stakeholders make informed decisions and design effective conservation marketing campaigns based on evidence. © 2019, AESS.",Behavioral science; Biodiversity loss; Conservation education; Conservation marketing; Conservation psychology; Social science,Springer New York LLC,scopus-recommendation
When less is more: Empirical study of the relation between consumer behavior and information provision on commercial landing pages,Dvir N.; Gafni R.,2018,10.28945/4015,"Aim/Purpose This paper describes an empirical examination of how users' willingness to dis-close personal data is influenced by the amount of information provided on landing pages - standalone web pages created explicitly for marketing or adver-tising campaigns. Background Provision of information is a central construct in the IS discipline. Content is a term commonly used to describe the information made available by a website or other electronic medium. A pertinent debate among scholars and practitioners relate to the behavioral impact of content volume: Specifically, does a greater amount of information elicit engagement and compliance, or the other way around? Methodology A series of large-scale web experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) were conduct-ed employing a between-subjects design and A/B testing. Two variants of land-ing pages, long and short, were created based on relevant behavioral theories. Both variants included an identical form to collect users' information, but dif-ferent amounts of provided content. User traffic was generated using Google AdWords and randomized between the page using Unbounce.com. Relevant usage metrics, such as response rate (called ""conversion rate""), location, and visit time were recorded. Contribution This research contributes to the body of knowledge on information provision and its effectiveness and carries practical and theoretical implications to practi-tioners and scholars in Information Systems, Informing Science, Communica-tions, Digital Marketing, and related fields. Findings Analyses of results show that the shorter landing pages had significantly higher conversion rates across all locations and times. Findings demonstrate a negative correlation between the content amount and consumer behavior, suggesting that users who had less information were more inclined to provide their data. Recommendations for Practitioners At a practical level, results can empirically support business practices, design considerations, and content strategy by informing practitioners on the role of content in online commerce. Recommendation for Researchers Findings suggest that the amount of content plays a significant role in online decision making and effective informing. They also contradict prior research on trust, persuasion, and security. This study advances research on the paradoxical relationship between the increased level of information and online decision-making and indicates that contrary to earlier work, not all persuasion theories are effective online. Impact on Society Understanding how information drives behavior has implications in many do-mains (civic engagement, health, education, and more). This has relevance to system design and public communication in both online and offline contexts. Future Research Using this research as a starting point, future research can examine the impact of content in other contexts, as well as other behavioral drivers (such as demo-graphic data). This can lead to theoretical, methodological, and practical rec-ommendations. © 2018 Informing Science Institute.",Consumer behavior; Content strategy; Deci-sion making; E-commerce; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Informing science; Marketing; User engagement,Informing Science Institute,scopus-recommendation
Enhancing interdisciplinary climate change work through comprehensive evaluation,Klink J.; Koundinya V.; Kies K.; Robinson C.; Rao A.; Berezowitz C.; Widhalm M.; Prokopy L.,2017,10.1016/j.crm.2016.11.003,"This paper shares the details of an evaluation plan from an interdisciplinary climate change project that developed decision support tools (DSTs) DST = Decision Support Tool. 2 for agricultural advisors and farmers. It showcases how evaluation enhanced the project work by providing opportunities for the team to reflect on and use data to improve performance. The plan included both formative and summative approaches, team member interviews to assess team functioning, usability testing of DSTs, outreach and marketing campaign evaluation. Outreach evaluation included surveying those reached, monitoring project website traffic, and tracking and mapping outreach details. Marketing evaluation included pre-testing campaign materials, assessing open and click rates of email campaign, and monitoring associated traffic to website. The Useful to Usable (U2U) team was generally high functioning, but team interviews allowed the evaluators and leaders to discern factors that were influencing intended outcomes, respond to needs, assign resources, and catalyze activities that were crucial in shaping the outcomes. Usability testing surfaced issues related to default values and search and help features that were addressed by the team and resulted in improved usability. Outreach evaluation found geographic and methodological gaps that were filled, resulting in more target audiences reached and more effective methods used (e.g., hands-on events). Marketing evaluation allowed for improving contact lists over time and improving campaign messaging before deployment. Evaluators and project leaders working on similar projects may adapt or utilize methods detailed in this paper, along with the recommendations, while designing and implementing improvement-oriented evaluation plans. © 2016 The Authors",Interdisciplinary team; Marketing campaign; Mixed methods evaluation; Outreach evaluation; Stakeholder engagement; Usability testing,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation
Augmented reality: Designing immersive experiences that maximize consumer engagement,Scholz J.; Smith A.N.,2016,10.1016/j.bushor.2015.10.003,"Innovative marketers can now leverage augmented reality to craft immersive brand experiences, create more interactive advertising, and enable consumers to experience products and spaces in novel ways. Augmented reality (AR) is the practice of displaying digital information over people's real-time view of objects, people, or spaces in the physical world. While AR can play a valuable role in integrated marketing programs, little is known about the practice and how to execute effective AR programs in the marketplace. We address this gap by presenting a framework that describes the active and passive ingredients of augmented reality. We then describe the basic design decisions that marketers need to make when planning an augmented reality campaign. In addition, we explain how understanding and addressing the dynamics between various active and passive AR ingredients can help marketers to optimize their AR campaigns and enhance various types of consumer engagement: user-brand engagement, user-user engagement, and user-bystander engagement. Through our framework and analysis, we develop eight actionable recommendations-described with the acronym ENTANGLE-marketing managers can use to design immersive AR experiences that maximize consumer engagement. © 2015 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.",Advertising; Augmented reality; Branding; Consumer engagement; Interactive marketing; Mobile marketing; Social media; User-generated content; Virtual reality,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Membership-based consumer switching intentions and benefit exchange theory,Chuang Y.-F.; Tai Y.-F.,2016,10.1108/IJCHM-10-2014-0514,"Purpose: This research aims to predict private club members’ intentions to switch service providers based on the benefit exchange theory through a structural model with a second-order factor. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative procedure to develop a functional, social and psychological model based on the benefit exchange and switching intention literatures. A further quantitative analysis surveyed a sample of 366 private club members and assessed the usefulness of this model. Findings: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling indicate that social benefits have a stronger impact on switching intention than loss of functional benefits under the context of a high level of interaction between members and between members and service providers. In addition, they confirm the moderating effects of psychological benefits on the relationship between functional benefits and switching intention. Practical implications: The findings indicate that members are unlikely to switch if there are positive word of mouth and interpersonal interactions between members and the club (social benefits). Even if they are disappointed with the functional benefits of the club’s products or services, they may still choose to stay with it owing to psychological benefits affecting their decision to switch. The findings offer managerial insights into utilizing relationship marketing activities to strengthen interpersonal relationships, word of mouth, trust, commitment and emotional factors to retain members. Originality/value: This research confirms that the benefit exchange theory can explain members’ intentions to switch from their current clubs and provides valuable recommendations to managers on retaining their clubs’ members. Because the switching intentions of club members have not previously been adequately studied, this study fills an important gap in the literature. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Benefit exchange; Consumer behavior; Hospitality; Membership; Private club; Switching intention,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Building agent-based decision support systems for word-of-mouth programs: A freemium application,Chica M.; Rand W.,2017,10.1509/jmr.15.0443,"Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM) programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide them valuable assistance in doing so. The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network-level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1 ) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Agent-based modeling; Freemium business model; Marketing decision support systems; Targeting and referrals; Word of mouth,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation

Library 2.0: The effectiveness of social media as a marketing tool for libraries in educational institutions,Jones M.J.; Harvey M.,2019,10.1177/0961000616668959,"In an attempt to market their services and connect with potential users, and particularly young people, many libraries are opening accounts on social media platforms. Research suggests a contradiction between the advice relating to marketing and that regarding the use of social media in libraries, with the former emphasising the importance of the user at the centre of all considerations and the latter placing library staff as central to decisions. In this work we attempt to re-address this imbalance by surveying the current state of library activity on Twitter and, by means of questionnaires, investigate the experiences and motivations of librarians (n=58) in using social media and whether students (n=498) are willing to engage with the library in this manner and why. Our findings confirm that libraries in the sector are indeed struggling to foster interest in their social media activities and go some way to understanding why this is so, leading to a number of conclusions and recommendations for practitioners. © The Author(s) 2016.",Library 2.0; marketing; social media,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-recommendation

Exploring the multi-sided nature of crowdfunding campaign success,Lagazio C.; Querci F.,2018,10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.05.031,"Successful crowdfunding campaigns are multifaceted in nature and depend on marketing and organizational features. This study identifies the most appealing factors and analyzes the results through a multi-theory approach as follows. First, contrary to altruism and warm-glow giving theories, crowdfunding to support social impact projects does not perform well. Second, fixed campaigns, small-sized projects, and prolonged campaigns are more likely to be funded, in line with goal-setting theory. Additionally, the resource-based view of firms clarifies the importance of having large entrepreneurial teams. Further, narrative theories about persuasion and information processing provide insights into why detailed text descriptions are more persuasive than pitch videos. Finally, this study relies on social identity and signaling theories to illustrate the impressive role of social networks and discussion forums between fundraisers and backers for developing effective word-of-mouth.

Medical errors: extreme service failures and recoveries,Black H.G.; Goad E.A.; Attaway J.S.,2018,10.1108/IJPHM-11-2016-0063,"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship among jurors’ attribution of responsibility of the error, patient styles and juror decisions (e.g. acquittal of the physician). Specifically, this research examines the influence of an individual’s approach to their healthcare (active vs. passive), and decisions to acquit in malpractice cases. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 459 individuals were surveyed using a commercial call center for participation in a corresponding mail survey. Surveys were also distributed to undergraduate business students at a Midwestern university. Findings: Cluster analysis revealed two categories of patient styles: “active patients” (39.4 per cent) and “passive patients” (60.6 per cent). Regardless of patient style, this research found all respondents viewed medical error disclosure as important. However, respondents in the passive group were more likely to acquit the physician and the hospital nursing staff as compared with those classified as active. Practical implications: The safety of patients in the healthcare system and prevention of errors is a critical issue. However, when errors occur, medical providers should disclose information to the patient and take responsibility to attenuate their negative impact. Further, this research reveals that patients who rely more on their physicians, trust their recommendations and question physicians less are more likely to acquit. Medical providers can use this information as motivation to continue to build this type of trust with their patients. Originality/value: Medical errors are costly for all parties involved. This research provides insight for not only members of the legal profession involved in medical malpractice cases, but also risk managers and hospital administrators and healthcare providers regarding the decision-making process used by individuals serving on a jury. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Healthcare marketing; Medical errors,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Unlocking competitiveness through scent names: A data-driven approach,Meng H.M.; Zamudio C.; Jewell R.D.,2018,10.1016/j.bushor.2018.01.004,"Naming a product's scent is a key decision. The same scent can be interpreted differently when different names are assigned to it. Thus, choosing the right scent name can increase competitiveness by successfully appealing to desired consumer segments. We propose that such decisions should be data driven (i.e., on the basis of competitors’ offerings and consumers’ preferences) and provide guidelines on how to assign scent names to products in home care and personal care product categories, focusing on capturing market segments. Based on a large web-based dataset of scented products across multiple brands and categories, this article is the first to construct a typology of scent names empirically: unscented, concrete, abstract, and proprietary. After examining firms’ assortments of scented products with different names across 12 categories and comparing them with consumers’ preferences concerning such assortments, we identify major gaps. Overall, consumers demand far more unscented products and products with abstract names than currently offered; however, preferences for products with proprietary names are mostly aligned. Strategic recommendations center on naming scented products to better align supply and demand in the scented product market and capture new market opportunities. © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Data-driven decision making; Market segmentation; Retail marketing; Scented products; Sensory marketing,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Behavioural segmentation analysis of online consumer audience in Turkey by using real e-commerce transaction data,Huseynov F.; Yildirim S.Ö.,2017,10.1504/IJEBR.2017.085549,"This study is about determining the different consumer segments in online shopping platforms. Consumer segmentation is a marketing strategy which involves firstly dividing customers into groups based on their underlying characteristics, needs and interests, and then designing and implementing strategies to target them. One of the most common types of segmentation approaches is behavioural segmentation analysis in which consumers are grouped based on their certain behavioural characteristics such as decision making, spending, usage, etc. This study carried out behavioural segmentation analysis based on real e-commerce transaction records of 10,000 online customers and found five different types of online consumer segments which are opportunist customers, transient customers, need-based shoppers, skeptical newcomers and repetitive purchasers. Behavioural characteristics of each segment were discussed in detail and recommendations were made about how to approach to each segment in order to increase their online shopping rates. Understanding the behavioural characteristics of each segment will enable the selling companies to develop marketing strategies accordingly. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",B2C e-commerce; behavioural segmentation analysis; market segmentation; online consumer behaviour; online shopping; segmentation analysis; Turkey; two step cluster analysis,Inderscience Publishers,scopus-recommendation
An exploratory study on local brand value development for Outlying Island Agriculture: Local food system and actor-network theory perspectives,Tang J.-W.; Chen M.-L.; Chiu T.-H.,2018,10.3390/su10114186,"Due to the sweeping influence of capitalism, most food processing is now done through standardized production workflows in order to quickly replicate and churn out a large quantity of products. This has led to an increasing number of homogenized and delocalized products flooding the market and a disconnection between consumers and local food producers. Penghu outlying island is rich in unique local agricultural products but seriously lacks brand images and channel strategies, as manifested in an unstable demand and supply, a high degree of homogeneity (in products) and the majority of farmers producing and selling their products autonomously. This study applies the local food system and actor-network theory as the basis of theoretical frameworks as well as agricultural practices in Penghu as the research object. We used field investigation, in-depth interview and the means-end chain method to examine important contextual factors' influence on the local agricultural food system, important actors and challenges and key influential factors for local brand value that affect the development of the local agricultural food system in Penghu outlying island. The actor-network perceptual map of local brand value proposed in this study can help agricultural practitioners when making decisions and can formulate strategies for their products to increase the product visibility and recognition. This perceptual map can also facilitate the expansion of the target customers and channel distributions suitable for individual agricultural products. Our study presents the following recommendations: increase the manpower of agricultural practices through the working holiday approach; local government should provide support enabling agriculture producers to gain professional knowledge in marketing; and agriculture producers should form cooperatives which focus on the unique local agricultural products that are produced and marketed locally in Penghu. © 2018 by the authors.",Actor-network theory; Local brand value; Local food system; Outlying island agriculture,MDPI,scopus-recommendation
Why strategy is key for successful social media sales,Lindsey-Mullikin J.; Borin N.,2017,10.1016/j.bushor.2017.03.005,"Many successful companies spend substantial time and effort engaging with potential consumers on social media sites. They determine how consumers spend their time online and develop interesting content to increase awareness and enjoyment of the brand—often only to lose those potential customers because the purchase process becomes too difficult once consumers have decided to buy the product. New technology recently introduced by third-party vendors allows companies to offer a sales option directly on social media websites such as Facebook and Instagram. In this article, we present the effects on the consumer decision process created by the ‘Buy Now’ option across the consideration, evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase stages. We compare and contrast three distinct decision models: (1) traditional media only, (2) traditional media and social media with only a communication capability, and (3) traditional media and social media with the added function of immediate purchase. We argue that though the possibility of buying on social media will decrease the number of brands considered and evaluated, the number of purchases and amount of brand advocacy will increase significantly due to the ease of purchase. We conclude with some recommendations on future research. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Brand social media; Consumer decision-making process; Digital marketing; Retail social media; Social media sales,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation

Leveraging Distribution to Maximize Firm Performance in Emerging Markets,Kumar V.; Sunder S.; Sharma A.,2015,10.1016/j.jretai.2014.08.005,"Despite the rise of emerging markets as lucrative destinations for business expansion, marketing literature in this area is largely anecdotal and conceptual. Further, owing to the largely unorganized retail structure in emerging markets, managers tend to make sub-optimal marketing-mix decisions by taking an aggregate view of their distribution network. In this study, we develop an econometric model to help firms develop a multichannel distribution strategy in emerging markets while accounting for (a) own-marketing mix, (b) competitive actions, (c) brand-level heterogeneity, and (d) dependencies that may arise between product offerings. The proposed model is tested on longitudinal data from a large Indian CPG manufacturer. The results indicate that firms must consider store format-specific distribution elasticities (as opposed to aggregate effects), especially in an emerging market, where the role of distribution is critical in brand success. Further, depending on the offering, price (own- and cross-) and advertising elasticities could vary even though the brand is essentially the same. Also, we find that there are significant dependencies between product forms that need to be considered when designing the marketing mix. Finally, we provide re-allocation recommendations to help managers choose the level of store format distribution in order to maximize profits. The proposed distribution re-allocation strategy resulted in an average of 7.7% increase in profits across three product forms for the focal firm. © 2014.",Distribution elasticity; Emerging markets; Marketing mix; Multichannel retailing; Product forms; Store formats,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation

From consumer decision to market share - Unanimity of majority?,Kowalska-Styczeń A.; Sznajd-Weron K.,2016,10.18564/jasss.3156,"We use a general cellular automata model to study the consumer decision-making process. Within this general model we use three different rules governing word-of-mouth communication (w-o-m), one majority rule and two unanimity rules, and ask the question if differences between these three w-o-m rules, introduced on the microscopic level, will manifest on the macroscopic level. We show that in the model with the majority rule the neighborhood plays a significant role in terms of the market shares whereas movement (interpreted as seeking for information in other sources) is almost negligible. Exactly the opposite phenomena are observed for models in which unanimity, instead of majority, is needed to convince agents. We also introduce a modification of the unanimity rule, based on the Latane theory of the social influence, and show that on the macroscopic level this modification is indistinguishable from the simple unanimity rule. We conclude the paper with a recommendation which rules are more appropriate to model particular marketing phenomena. © 2016, University of Surrey.

Identifying the switching determinants of mobile enterprise customers: The perspective of pull - push mooring model and mobile number portability,Ramnath Babu C.N.S.; Sundar S.,2019,10.17010/ijom/2019/v49/i6/144697,"This study aimed at finding out the key determinants of switching behaviour among the enterprise customers of mobile network operators based on the push - pull - mooring theory and to ascertain the influence of mobile number portability on switching behaviour. An extensive review of literature coupled with focus group discussion and 11 one-to-one in-depth interviews provided the impetus to the design and development of the survey instrument, which was then administered through e-mail to the enterprise customers in rest of Tamil Nadu telecom circle. This descriptive research study adopted multi­stage, non-probability sampling method and convenience sampling technique to administer the field and e-mail survey to collect the primary data. This study identified the push factors (network services, billing system, service encounters, technology, and convenience) and pull factors (reputation, brand image, word-of-mouth recommendation, and pricing) that caused switching as well as the mooring factor (switching cost) that influenced the customers' decision to stay with or switch from the current in-use service provider. These factors will help mobile network operators (MNOs) to identify unsatisfied customers and to optimally allocate marketing resources to retain them satisfied and loyal to the brand, and also to acquire new customers. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Measuring quality regarding destination marketing: perceptions from local public stakeholders in Portugal,Antunes Moura A.F.; Mendes Mónico L.S.; do Rosário Campos Mira M.,2019,10.18089/tms.2019.150104,"Based on academic research and international recommendations on tourism quality, this study sought to develop a wide-ranging tourism quality scale adapted for Portuguese contexts. The research included creating and validating a marketing subscale to measure local public stakeholders’ perceptions of marketing strategies focused on improving tourism destinations’ quality. A self-administered survey was conducted with a sample of Portuguese municipalities including, more specifically, 134 local public stakeholders commonly considered local destination marketing organisations, as well as public policy- and decision-makers. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to measure destination marketing quality, resulting in the identification of two factors: (1) image and promotion and (2) product differentiation. The proposed instrument was shown to have validity and reliability and to be a useful measurement tool. The findings highlight local public stakeholders’ responsibility to ensure the quality and competitiveness of tourism destinations’ marketing and provide multiple useful practical and theoretical implications and insights to guide future research. © 2023 Tourism and Management Studies.

The role of travel agents’ ethical concerns when brokering information in the marketing and sale of sustainable tourism,Mossaz A.; Coghlan A.,2017,10.1080/09669582.2016.1198358,"Using conservation tourism as a test case, this study explores the role high-end travel agents play in selling sustainable tourism. It examines a niche marketing activity in that process. The study focuses on agents’ consideration of ethics as they act as information brokers between tourists and operators. Data were collected from interviews with agents and analysed using a deductive content analysis based on six overarching concepts and theories on ethical decision-making. The findings emphasize the implicit influence within conservation tourism of tourism's ethical dimensions, whilst identifying many constraints that prevent a full consideration and/or disclosure of ethical concerns in the sales process. Most importantly, agents made assumptions using a false consensus bias about clients' preferences for service over concerns for the environment, and were not prepared to discuss the more sensitive issues surrounding conservation with their clients. A number of recommendations are proposed regarding the need to unpack conservation information, overcome the false consensus bias, and agents’ reluctance to discuss ethics in the sales process. Finally, the findings have broader implications for the development of sustainable tourism, which ultimately will depend on a dialogue of ethical concerns and values within the tourism supply chain between suppliers, brokers and tourists. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Conservation; ethical decision-making; marketing; travel agents,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Predicting Innovation Success in the Motion Picture Industry: The Influence of Multiple Quality Signals,Bharadwaj N.; Noble C.H.; Tower A.; Smith L.M.; Dong Y.,2017,10.1111/jpim.12404,"In settings characterized by frequent product entries and rapid market exit, predicting innovation success is a difficult task. The challenge in such short life-cycle markets is exacerbated when the offering is an experience good (i.e., product quality is not known prior to consumption). This article investigates a variety of information disequilibrium-reducing cues that can signal a new product's quality, and posit that those cues affect knowledge of and attitude toward (i.e., customers' mindset) the item, and in turn, demand. The work draws on signaling theory in an experience good context (motion pictures) to set up a nomological net that includes three sources of quality cues as predictors of consumer demand, namely: (i) traditional prelaunch decisions (e.g., production budget, advertising budget, and sequel), (ii) volume and valence of movie critics' reviews, and (iii) text contained in the movie critics' reviews. Based on a stratified, random sample of movie introductions (n = 115), the results show that the prelaunch (structured numeric) variables alone explain a meaningful proportion of the variance in domestic box office sales. The postlaunch (structured numeric) variables, volume and valence of critics' reviews, add more explanatory power, and analyzing over two million words from the (unstructured) text of critics' reviews adds further explanatory power. This research answers a recent call to model the variety of structured and unstructured variables to predict innovation success in data-rich environments, and thereby represents the pioneering study to combine all three sources of quality cues—(i) prelaunch, structured variables; (ii) postlaunch, structured variables; and (iii) postlaunch, unstructured variables derived from text reviews—as determinants of demand. The approach taken also substantiates film as innovation and as an interesting case of new product development. For managers in a short life-cycle, experience good settings, the results support the inclusion of a broader “variety” of quality signals to improve forecasting in today's data-rich environments. Practitioner Points: The results here highlight the importance of considering both marketing decisions and expert reviews in forecasting approaches for new product launches. Exploring a nuanced approach to analyzing expert reviews seems to be particularly promising in predicting product successes and failures. This research also helps us develop a deeper understanding of the nature of critics' reviews. Beyond just “thumbs up/thumbs down” sort of recommendations, we identify specific words that are influential in making an impression on consumers and, ultimately, driving product success or failure. This work also emphasizes the challenges of predicting success in markets for short life-cycle experience goods such as films. In these markets, expert reviews likely carry even more weight since consumers have great difficulty in assessing the product in advance. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,scopus-recommendation
"The system of marketing information management: Development, assessment, improvement",Ashmarina S.; Zotova A.,2016,10.21003/ea.V160-10,"The development of modern economy highlights the role and importance of information factor while making managerial decisions especially in the sphere of marketing activity of any organisation. Under such circumstances the problem of forming effective marketing information systems is becoming crucially important for Russian organisations. Marketing analysis is rather poor in modern Russian economy mainly because the history of Russian market economy is not so long and the analysis does not have enough bases of historical statistics data during the «new era» of functioning of Russian economy. Marketing information systems based on new technologies of processing and synthesising of information flows might improve the situation. The current research is dedicated to solving the following tasks: to classify different kinds of marketing information at the enterprise; to define the marketing information system according to the authors' point of view; to elaborate the methods of assessment of the enterprise information supply and to create a model of effective marketing information system. The research tasks represented in the article are aimed to elaborate some practical recommendations regarding information supply of marketing activities of industrial enterprises, namely: JSC «Tyazhmash», JSC «Uralmashzavod» and JSC «MK Ormeto-Yumz». Big industrial enterprises of the Russian Federation served as a practical platform for the analysis of the marketing information system.

Exploring the supply chain management of fair trade business: case study of a fair trade craft company in China,Zhang K.; Liu Z.; Wang P.,2020,10.1080/23311975.2020.1734345,"For two decades, fair trade has served as an alternative approach of trading that encourages minimal returns, sustainability, and ethics, by offering producers in developing countries better trading conditions and secured rights. This movement has emerged recently in China, with companies involving domestic trading between richer and poorer regions. However, lack of third-party certification, standardization, process control, public awareness, and brand recognition continue to be challenges. To understand the current fair trade business in China, this paper investigates important decision-making areas from a supply chain management perspective. With the nature of empirical studies, an in-depth case analysis of a fair trade craft company has been conducted along with the purchasing and supplier relationship management, internal operations, and marketing and customer relationship management. This company currently combines the role of fair trade organization and retailer, by implementing an in-house certification system and vertically integrating the supply chain. Findings also highlight risk at each stage of supply chain. Compared with the western society, the unique features of Chinese fair trade business are captured with prioritized areas for improvement. This research contributes to the fair trade literature by providing exploratory study into emerging issues in the supply chain, particularly inside developing countries. The recommendations also create value for policy-makers and practitioners of fair trade companies. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Approaches to geomarketing via office locations serving individuals and legal entities of a commercial bank,Dolzhenko R.A.,2017,10.17323/1998-0663.2017.3.41.55,"In this article we examine the possibility of using geomarketing as a tool for modeling the spatial location of a bank’s offices serving individuals and legal entities. Geomarketing is a marketing concept of modern production management based on geo-information technologies which involves the use of spatially localized information to support decision-making. This concept is particularly timely for commercial banks which present their services to customers in an extensive network of service offices, because for the majority of banking services the determining factor in the consumer’s choice of bank for a given service will be the convenience of the location of its office. The article describes a sequence of typical steps in geomarketing simulations and makes recommendations for the implementation of each selected stage. Methodical approaches to the implementation of geomarketing modeling for an optimal network of the bank’s service offices are highlighted. Problems in the organization of the network of service offices of the bank which can be solved with the help of geomarketing design are studied. Recommendations are presented for evaluating the capacity of a commercial bank’s office service network depending on their specialization in serving individuals or legal entities. An algorithm is presented for calculating the service office network capacity for individuals together with respective formulas. An approach to evaluating the capacity of the office network servicing legal entities is described. Recommendations are offered for implementing the evaluation of planned location of offices servicing the bank’s clients, as well as for determining the habitats of their preferred location to facilitate the most effective coverage of the local market while taking into account the return on investment in offices. © 2020 Business Informatics.

The impact of purchase goal on wine purchase decisions,Dobele A.R.; Greenacre L.; Fry J.,2018,10.1108/IJWBR-07-2016-0021,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of purchasing occasion on product value indicators for a selection of Australian and New Zealand branded wines, as evaluated by consumers. Value indicators were defined as conspicuous or inconspicuous. Conspicuous indicators include corporate advertising, such as the vineyard, region or brand, and are considered the same (or equal) for all recipients. Inconspicuous indicators are less visible and may differ from recipient to recipient, such as referrals. Purchasing occasions are either home (personal and private) or restaurant consumption (personal and public) or as a gift (impersonal and public). Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was used to understand the changing importance of value indicators based on differing purchase goals. The snowball sample was comprised of marketing professionals, who are highly educated and likely to be of prime working age (25-55 years). Initial participants were then asked to forward the email invitation to their networks. The majority of the 298 survey respondents were Australian-born and described themselves as Anglo-Saxon. Findings: Conspicuous indicators, such as advertising, are given more consideration for impersonal consumption experiences such as gifts or to drink in public. Less conspicuous, but more trustworthy, indicators, (personal recommendations), are more important for personal consumption experiences. These results offer insight into the indicators of product value that marketers could emphasise in their marketing mixes to target consumers buying with different purchase goals in mind and seek new markets. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited in geographical selection, and the methodology comprised an online survey. The nature of the purchase contexts was deliberately kept broad to highlight the overall impact of value indicators. Originality/value: While there have been some studies centering on wine purchase and consumption in different situations, direct comparisons between contexts are rare. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by comparing consumer behaviour across wine purchase contexts. The value of this paper stems from deepening understanding of the role of context in purchase decision-making and the implications for marketing practitioners and clearly identified opportunities for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Online survey; Purchase context; Purchase indicators; Seemingly unrelated regression; Value judgements; Wine marketing,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

Online retailers’ management system of marketing commodity policy,Natorina A.,2018,10.21003/ea.V174-11,"Introduction. In the conditions of continuous change and bifurcations of the marketing environment, the system of management of marketing commodity policy (SMMCP) of online retailers is impacted by a set of immanent components, the inclusion of which makes it possible to multiply the efficiency of their functioning in the cyber space and timely adjust the plan to implement marketing activities. In this regard, the urgency in substantiating, systematising the immanent components (quantitative measurement) and developing practical principals relevant to the assessment of the impact of such components on the SMMCP of online retailers based on the use of a multidimensional simulation method is becoming more relevant. The purpose of this article is to develop canonical models for assessing the impact of partial immanent components (quantitative measurement) on the SMMCP of online retailers, taking into account the corresponding latent root causes. In order to automate calculations and construct canonical models, the authors of the article use the demo version of the «STATISTICA» software package. Results. The author of the article has substantiated and systematised the immanent components and their impact on the SMMCP of online retailers (quantitative measurement), as well as the root causes of the formation of the SMMCP of online retailers that determine the partial immanent components of impact, and explained the correlation between the corresponding attributes, giving their meaningful interpretation. Consequently, canonical models for assessing of partial immanent components of impact on the SMMCP of online retailers, the implementation of which is the basis for making effective marketing decisions and achievement of corresponding goals by applying managerial impact locally. Conclusion. The approbation of the developed canonical models has allowed the author to single out three groups of online retailers and formulate practical recommendations with regard to further implementation of marketing activities. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.",Canonical models; Immanent components of influence; Latent root causes; Management system of marketing commodity policy (MSMCP); Online retailers,Institute of Society Transformation,scopus-recommendation

The impact of word of mouth on service purchase decisions: Examining risk and the interaction of tie strength and involvement,Voyer P.A.; Ranaweera C.,2015,10.1108/JSTP-04-2014-0070,"Purpose – Primarily, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the interaction and direct effects of tie strength between sender and receiver of word of mouth (WOM) and the receiver’s service purchase decision involvement on WOM influence. A secondary aim is to investigate how a distinctive conceptualization of perceived risk, consisting of two types (outcome risk and psychosocial risk), affects service purchase decision involvement. A conceptual model incorporating these constructs and associated hypotheses is developed and tested. Design/methodology/approach – In a survey of actual service consumers, respondents were asked to recall a recent instance where they had received service purchase information via WOM, and relate their responses to this instance. Established scales were used to measure the constructs. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings – Principally, findings demonstrate a strong interaction effect between service purchase decision involvement and tie strength. Also, results highlight the complexity of the perceived risk construct, suggesting that it is appropriately modeled as two types: outcome risk, and psychosocial risk. Research limitations/implications – This research has contributed to the service marketing literature by testing a model that predicts WOM influence. Evidence confirmed that the effect of service purchase decision involvement on WOM influence is moderated by tie strength. Additionally, a conceptualization of two different types of risk associated with purchase decisions was suggested, together with empirical confirmation of their hypothesized antecedent effects on service purchase decision involvement. Findings have special implications for the literatures of persuasion, social and interpersonal influence, as well as consumer behavior in general. Practical implications – To harness the power of WOM, managers should understand who their target audience is and how consumers are related to each other (tie strength) and to the service purchase decision (service purchase decision involvement). Recommendations are made with specific illustrations of how firms can leverage tie strength under conditions of low service purchase decision involvement to enhance WOM influence. Originality/value – The formidable power of WOM wields substantial influence on consumers, particularly within a service (vs goods) purchase context, typically characterized by higher perceived risk and lower search qualities. The significant interaction between tie strength and service purchase decision involvement is a unique contribution to the service WOM literature. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Influence; Involvement; Risk; Service purchase decision; Tie strength; Word of mouth,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
The Influence Factors Towards Mobile Advertising Message Content on Consumer Purchase Intention,Hashim N.H.; Normalini; Sajali N.,2018,10.1177/0972150918788746,"The purpose of this research is to study consumer attitude towards mobile advertising in Malaysia, and whether this attitude results in the intention to purchase the products or services advertised. This article reports on the results, based on factors such as entertainment, informativeness, irritation and credibility, which the research framework derives from Ducoffe (1996, Advertising value and advertising on the Web, Journal of Advertising Research, 36(5), 21–35) and Mackenzie (1989, An empirical examination of the structural antecedents of attitude toward the ad in an advertising pretesting context, Journal of Marketing, 53(4), 48–65). Attitudes towards behaviours, and subjective norms, based on the research by Ajzen (1991, The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behaviour & Human Decision Processes, 50(2), 179–211), are included in understanding consumer intention. A survey is conducted on 150 respondents, and the partial least squares analysis is used to determine the antecedents of mobile advertising that lead to consumer acceptance of mobile advertising, and the resulting intention to purchase. Results show that the advertising message content has the largest impact on attitude in advertising that is done via mobile phone. Attitudes towards mobile advertising are linked to the intention to purchase the product or services advertised. The main implication of the study shows that marketing managers should focus their marketing communication on mobile advertising, and increasing the attractiveness of this form of advertising, so as to reflect consumers’ intention to purchase. This study opens a new channel of communication for multiple unexamined matters concerning the mobile advertising industry.

CLUN: A business-case of concentration by merger of three dairy cooperatives at Galicians agrarian cooperatives; [CLUN: Concentración por fusión de tres cooperativas lácteas en el cooperativismo agrario en Galicia],Domínguez M.B.; Blanco A.O.; Márquez M.C.,2019,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.96.12915,"Objectives Despite being a strategic sector of Galician's economy, the dairy sector has been traditionally characterized by its small-scale. This factor can inhibit the competitive potential of the companies operating in this area, mainly cooperatives. This paper provides an overview of the steps taken towards the consolidation of a second-degree cooperative known as CLUN -Cooperativas Lácteas Unidas. This process, taken together with a new merger (Aira, SCG) redefines the agrarian cooperative sector as well as the Galician dairy one. We start by providing a brief analysis of the dairy sector in Spain and Galicia to depict the general context in which this study is undertook. Then, we outline the setting up of CLUN as a concentration process on the Galician agrarian sector. We analyze both the former companies which jointly manage the second-degree one, and the different stages carried out. Next, we identify the major remaining changes to be resolved on the medium term and the main conclusions of the process. Finally, we set up several recommendations regarding the success of this process and other similar consolidations. Taken this into account, our main objective is to further the study in the role of the size and the concentration processes on the competitiveness of cooperatives, shedding light on the main factors that can might improve -or inhibit- these processes. In sum, we aim to analyze the threats and opportunities that mergers generate when are implemented, and to provide information about some factors that can improve the opportunities towards a successful concentration. Method In order to accomplish our goals, we used a mixed method. First, a review of the main indicators of the agrarian cooperatives -both in Spain and Galicia- has been conducted. This enables us to contextualize our study. Second, we conducted a broad review on the academic literature related to this field, focusing on both those papers that highlight the importance of the size of cooperatives on competitiveness and those that carried out research on concentration processes. Finally, we introduce some issues that suggest the convenience of using a qualitative approach. More specifically, we aim to obtain some information about the business-case as perceived by its internal stakeholders. In this respect, some managers were interviewed to identify the main factors they found interesting related to the topic. Results Since the first consolidated income statement has not been approved to date, it is early to determine the financial success of the integration process. However, it is possible to identify some of the factors that have been traditionally related to the competitiveness of agro-food companies: size, diversification and market orientation. Therefore, it might be suggested that the CLUN's creation represents a daring commitment to improve the competitiveness on the dairy sector. In addition, we can highlight several practices that seem to favor the implementation. Some of them are related to the idiosyncrasy of the organizations, while others arose as a result of the procedures implemented along the integration. In the first place, although the three former companies were linked on their corporate object, the different specialization's focuses make them complementary. Thus, Feiraco plays a leading role in marketing and distribution; Os Irmandiños in the manufacture of feed and Melisanto has an important portfolio of services for its members. This complementarity helped, for example, to avoid the transfer of personnel and to facilitate the establishment of the decision centers at headquarters. Secondly, we would like to highlight the background on organizational knowledge that the three cooperatives had among themselves, since they had previously shared business in recent years. This mutual knowledge leads to improve the opportunities to undertake merger' processes in a natural way and to overcome in turn possible frictions. This circumstance, taken together with the coincidence on the company kind and also with the observance of the principles of the Corporate Governance within cooperatives, seems to suggest that they have similar business cultures. This factor is crucial for the success of any concentration process, since that in addition to the financial and organizational adjustment social alignment is essential. Therefore, the combination of a similar business culture and a coordinated management team can help in the successful accomplishment of the integration. However, we claim the need to advance in the equalization of rights, obligations and benefits among workers, in order to reduce some risks in the integration. Finally, it should be noted that there was a common choice of the external and independent stakeholder for the realization of the valuation proposal and subsequent determination of the percentage of participation of each organization in the resulting entity. In this way, a process that could be a source of conflict is carried out in a widely accepted way. In future research it would be interesting to analyze whether these factors could be hierarchized, and also if there are significant differences between the different stakeholders that have participated in the concentration. Namely, if managers of cooperatives have opinions that are statistically different from those provided by workers or external stakeholders. In addition, it could be explored whether types of factors could be established. For instance, social, organizational and financial ones. Contribution This work helps to increase the existing evidence about concentration processes in cooperatives. This kind of business have proven to be a successful way to reduce the unemployment. In addition, they have showed to be able to maintain a certain amount anticyclic behavior in order to survive on financial crisis. But to improve their opportunity of succeeding, they still need to implement strategies to favor their competitiveness. Our results show that effort has to be placed mainly in concentration but keeping in mind that It is important for members to learn how to handle problems and potential clashes using the right practices. It should be noted that CLUN operates as a first-degree cooperative since January of 2019. This suggests that these corporate restructuring processes seem to be very active in Galicia, which highlights the convenience of monitoring them. Further initiatives int this respect might raise the level of consciousness towards the importance of societal dimension to sharpen the competitiveness of companies working in this field. © 2012 Universitat de València.",Business concentration; CLUN; Cooperatives; Dairy sector; Galicia; Merger; Social economy,CIRIEC,scopus-recommendation
Impact of social commerce constructs and social support on social commerce intentions,Sheikh Z.; Yezheng L.; Islam T.; Hameed Z.; Khan I.U.,2019,10.1108/ITP-04-2018-0195,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of social commerce constructs (SCCs), social support and relationship quality on social commerce intentions, which lead to use behaviour of social networking sites for social commerce. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 343 users of social networking sites in Pakistan. The data analysis was conducted using PLS-SEM. Findings: The results show that SCCs have empowered consumers through the existence of virtual groups, ratings and reviews and recommendations and referrals, thereby having a significant impact on social commerce intentions. The relationship quality with social networking sites, measured through commitment, satisfaction and trust, also proved to be a leading forecaster of social commerce intentions. The impact of social support could not positively influence the relationship quality with the social networking site. However, social support influences the social commerce intentions significantly. Research limitations/implications: Future research should enrich model with some moderating variables and data may be collected from actual online shoppers only. Practical implications: This study provides valuable insights to retailers to formulate their social commerce strategies as per decision factors results to have maximum engagement of consumers in social commerce.

On business-enterprise organization: A praxis research,Georgantzas N.C.,2018,10.3233/HSM-180368,"Indentured to trends emerging worldwide in business-enterprise organization, this article relays the transformation that ensued from the process of building a system dynamics (SD) model, intended to provide decision-support for a firm competing in high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) industry. The SD modeling process helped the client firm see a considerable increase in its daily revenue, with a potential increase in accounting profit of 62 percent per day. These benefits accrued from transforming the firm's value chain of HSFO marketing and sales processes and operations, while facilitating the self-development of its internal capability to rely on the SD modeling process for strategy design and implementation tactics.

Whom do we trust? Cultural differences in consumer responses to online recommendations,Fan A.; Shen H.; Wu L.; Mattila A.S.; Bilgihan A.,2018,10.1108/IJCHM-01-2017-0050,"Purpose: Consumers increasingly depend on the internet as the information source to make their hospitality decisions, which highlights the need for more research in online recommendation. Due to the globalization, culture and its effects on marketing become an increasingly important subject to investigate. Therefore, this paper aims to offer a cross-cultural investigation of consumers’ different trustworthiness and credibility perceptions when facing online recommendations from different information resources. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the source-credibility theory to examine consumers’ responses to online recommendations from two sources. Participants were recruited from two equivalent marketing panels in each culture. A 2 (online recommendation source: in-group vs out-group) by 2 (culture: American vs Chinese) between-subjects quasi-experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results demonstrate that culture moderates consumer responses to the two types of online sources. Chinese consumers, due to their more collectivist nature, exhibit higher levels of purchase intent when the recommendation originates from an in-group rather than from an out-group. Such differences are not observed among the more individualist American consumers. Furthermore, trustworthiness plays an important role in influencing Chinese consumers’ perception of recommendation credibility and the consequent purchase intent. Practical implications: This research provides guidelines to hospitality practitioners when developing their social networking sites and online marketing strategies across different cultures. Originality/value: The current study conducts an in-depth investigation of cultural differences in consumers’ perceptions of and reactions to online recommendations from other customers with various social distances. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cross-cultural study; Online recommendation; Other customers; Quasi-experiment; Source-credibility model,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Customer win-back: the role of attributions and perceptions in customers’ willingness to return,Pick D.; Thomas J.S.; Tillmanns S.; Krafft M.,2016,10.1007/s11747-015-0453-6,"Interest in customer reacquisition has increased as firms embrace the concept of customer relationship management. Using survey and transactional data from defected subscribers of a publishing company, we investigate how defected customers evaluate their propensity to return to the company prior to any win-back offer. We introduce a new variable for relationship marketing, general willingness to return (GWR), and show that it is strongly and positively related to the actual return decision and the duration of the restarted relationship. Combining attribution theory elements with existing win-back explanations, which focus on economic, social, and emotional value perceptions, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the GWR to a former relationship. Importantly, we learn that regardless of whose fault it is, if the reasons for the relationship termination can change or are preventable and the firm can control those changes, then the defected customer has a higher general willingness to return to the former relationship. Also, we show that the duration of time absence before relationship revival moderates the impact of GWR on second relationship duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that satisfaction prior to defection and the length of time absence provide a reasonable basis for distinguishing defected customers who differ in their GWR. By applying our findings, we derive recommendations for firms on how to position marketing communications to recapture defected customers according to their general willingness to return. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",Consumer attributions; Customer relationship management; Relationship revival,Springer New York LLC,scopus-recommendation
Bridging the gap between climate science and farmers in Colombia,Loboguerrero A.M.; Boshell F.; León G.; Martinez-Baron D.; Giraldo D.; Recaman Mejía L.; Díaz E.; Cock J.,2018,10.1016/j.crm.2018.08.001,"Agriculture is highly sensitive to variations in both weather and climate. Farmers face uncertainty in the weather patterns over the short term, and climate over the longer term. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) has promoted a system of Local Technical Agro-Climatic Committees (LTACs)4 in two Colombian regions to explore means of creating dialogue between researchers and farmers that would provide farmers with options in the face of both short- and longer-term variations in climate. The article uses a case study approach to describe how the original LTACs were established, the benefits obtained from the LTAC system, and the expansion of the system to areas outside Colombia. The basic premise behind the LTAC approach is: If farmers and the local rural community at large can access and understand weather and climate forecasts and the responses of their crop production, processing, and marketing options under local conditions, they can make better decisions on how to manage their farms and businesses. There are six basic components that are required to implement the LTAC approach to bridging the gap between climate science and farmers: (i) Establishment of the LTAC with alignment of local parties interested in managing variation in the climate and definition of their roles; (ii) local climate and monthly climate forecast; (iii) crop modeling and understanding of climate variation on crop production, processing and marketing and the impact this will have on management; (iv) dialogue between scientists, experts, and farmers; (v) dissemination and socialization of the dialogue; and (vi) local capacity building, which cuts across all the other five components. The regular monthly meetings of the LTACs are the focal point of the overall process, bringing together information from various sources, organizing the ideas and thoughts, and then disseminating the information. A feature of the committees was their diversity. The committees required specific inputs, particularly on climate and the crop response before each meeting. Research organizations provided climate forecasts and crop response data. The forecasts proved closer to reality than long term means and the crops models that were used to predict crop response to changes in management and climate variation were relatively simple and unsophisticated. The committees gained confidence in these prognoses, which then formed the basis for dialogue on how best to manage climate variation. The production-side participants appreciated the opportunity to present their own points of view and the move from top-down recommendations, coming from the researchers and extension agents, towards a menu of options which they discussed. At the same time, it was evident in the early meetings that many of the participants came ill-prepared to grasp concepts related to managing climatic variation, thus highlighting the need for capacity building within the LTACs themselves. LTACs actively promulgated their findings through bulletins, social networks, extension services, farmers’ organizations radio, TV, and the press. In the dry El Niño year of 2015, many farmers used the information generated by the LTACs to better manage their crops, increasing yields, and reducing losses. More LTACs are now being established in Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. These countries have understood the value of creating mechanisms through which researches and farmers can exchange ideas, with the farmers choosing options to improve their management based on better weather and climate forecasts and an understanding of how the weather and climate affects their crops. © 2018 The Authors",Agro-climatic information; CCAFS; Climate risk; Colombia; Local communities; Participatory approach,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation
The Influence of Innovativeness on On-Site Smartphone Use Among American Travelers: Implications for Context-Based Push Marketing,Tussyadiah I.P.,2016,10.1080/10548408.2015.1068263,"This study investigates the relationships between traveler innovativeness traits and the patterns of smartphone use during the experiential stage of travel. Using data collected from 1126 travelers residing in the United States (US), it was identified that tourism and technology innovativeness have significant positive effects on on-site use of smartphones for trip management, social networking, and searching deals, online reviews, and push recommendations. Technology innovativeness also influences smartphone use for navigation within destinations. The results suggest that highly innovative travelers are open to recommendations and influences when making on-site decisions, making them an effective target for context-based marketing. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Consumer innovativeness; context-based marketing; push recommendation; smartphones; travel applications,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Subsidiary strategy and managers’ perceptions of distance to foreign markets,Antunes I.C.M.; Barandas H.G.; Martins F.V.,2019,10.1108/RIBS-01-2019-0007,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how headquarters’ managers perceive – cultural, administrative, geographic and economic (CAGE) – distance between countries and its influence on the strategy of international subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the transaction cost and behavioural theory and presents an exploratory and qualitative methodology approach through six semi-structured in-depth interviews to evaluate managers’ perceptions of distance between countries. Findings: The research findings show that cultural and economic distances indeed have a major influence on subsidiary strategy and a smaller impact of administrative and geographic dimensions, which results into forced changes on the marketing-mix, i.e. product, price, design and brand, as well as on the level of autonomy granted to foreign subsidiaries. Research limitations/implications: The limitation is related to the home country and the entry mode of foreign direct investment. The findings presented here reflect the nature and behaviour of Portuguese companies with subsidiaries. Practical implications: The research provides recommendations for managers to be aware of the influence of more than one dimension of distance between countries to improve their decision-making of standardisation-adaptation strategy for foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, the study stresses that managers’ perceptions may lead to the conclusion that proximity and knowledge of foreign markets does not make international business easier. Originality/value: This empirical research not only tests the transaction cost theory and behavioural theory on managers’ decisions to invest abroad but also promotes organisational changes to achieve the suitable strategy for international subsidiaries. The study contributes to the area of international business by positing six research propositions concerning distance between countries to be tested in future studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Case study; Cultural administrative geographic economic distances; Foreign markets; Managers’ perceptions; Subsidiary strategy,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

The literature review discusses the theme focusing on adaptation versus standardization of the marketing strategy. Method: A theoretical model is proposed for the empirical investigation including the internal and external internationalization antecedents, the international marketing strategy, and the firm´s degree of internationalization. A qualitative, exploratory, empirical investigation based on a multiple-case study was conducted with three large Brazilian franchisors in the fashion industry. Relevance: The study highlights the relevance of international branding for the internationalization process as well as the role partners/franchisees play in building and managing brand image abroad. Results: The results show that the most important antecedents in the franchisors’ internationalization process were at the firm level (company size, resources, and capabilities; brand strength; international orientation, and experience), with special emphasis on the brand as a crucial asset. The international marketing strategies were to both adapt the marketing elements to the needs and characteristics of the host market and centralize strategic decisions to maintain a consistent brand image. This posture follows the semi-global marketing strategy. Theoretical contribution: This study contributes to the knowledge about the factors that influence the decision to internationalize and the international marketing strategies used by Brazilian franchisors abroad.

E-marketing strategies for islamic banking: A case based study,Roumieh A.; Garg L.; Gupta V.; Singh G.,2018,10.4018/JGIM.2018100105,"This article describes how e-marketing is increasingly gaining interest within Islamic businesses. It is important to consider the extent to which it fits comfortably within principle notions of Islam and Sharia law. An Islamic business should ensure that its e-marketing strategy must be devoid of any contentious or exaggerated claims and there must be no excessive risk. As marketing practices include accentuating the benefits and features of products and services, and downplaying the negative attributes which potentially could lead to a consumer making an informed decision based on this unbalanced presentation. Arguably, this presents a form of risk that may be at odds with the fundamental tenets of Islam. This article presents a case-study of a large bank in Kuwait to identify how e-Marketing can be implemented more effectively to attract new customers and retain the existing ones by critically evaluating the viability of e-marketing strategies for promoting Islamic banking. A set of recommendations are also provided to support all Islamic Banks in the development of an e-marketing strategy.

eWOM in the performing arts: exploratory insights for the marketing of theaters,Hausmann A.; Poellmann L.,2016,10.1108/AAM-08-2013-0013,"Purpose: – Word of mouth (WOM) plays an important role for the decision process of customers. This is especially interesting for service-dominant organizations like theaters where quality is more difficult to evaluate. In times of social media, third party recommendations can be given much more quickly, effectively and in greater detail. However, up to now not much has been researched on electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in a performing arts marketing context. The purpose of this paper is to provide some first exploratory insights into this research area. Design/methodology/approach: – To do so, a literature review is conducted to clarify the concept of eWOM and the relevance of recommendations in the performing arts. Then, parts of the results of an online survey on Facebook with 16 German theaters and their fans will be presented. Finally, the implications of the study results for theater marketing are considered and ideas for future research are discussed. Findings: – The study results confirm that recommendations have a high relevance for theatergoers and are very relevant in a social media context. They also show that the trustworthiness of eWOM on social media depends on the familiarity between the message sender and receiver. However, the results are limited with regard to the research design. Therefore, this paper concludes with ideas for further research. Originality/value: – All in all, though the study’s focus is narrow, this paper fills a research gap in the performing arts.

"How word-of-mouth transmission encouragement affects consumers’ transmission decisions, receiver selection, and diffusion speed",Stephen A.T.; Lehmann D.R.,2016,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.08.003,"This research considers how marketers can encourage or “nudge” consumers to transmit word of mouth (WOM), such as referrals or recommendations to friends, in a manner that helps reach, inform, or influence large numbers of consumers quickly, which is an outcome referred to as faster diffusion. Building on studies showing diffusion is faster when higher-connectivity people are involved; the authors propose a mechanism based on network externalities that encourages regular customers to select receivers who have higher levels of social connectivity. Three experiments and a simulation demonstrate the mechanism's efficacy by showing (i) how regular consumers can be encouraged to select higher-connectivity friends as WOM receivers, (ii) why this mechanism works, and (iii) how encouraging this receiver selection behavior can lead to faster diffusion at the macro level. The findings extend the WOM marketing literature by introducing an approach for encouraging transmissions to specific types of consumers that is a viable alternative to directly targeting higher-connectivity consumers in seeded WOM campaigns, which is often practically infeasible. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Diffusion; Field experiments; Incentives; Referrals; Social networks; Word of mouth,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation
Are tourists animal spirits? Evidence from a field experiment exploring the use of non-market based interventions advocating sustainable tourism,Araña J.E.; León C.J.,2016,10.1080/09669582.2015.1101128,"Tourists' travel decisions can be influenced by appropriate policies that seek to encourage them to choose travel plans leading to more sustainable tourism practices. Based on using conventional cognitive decision-making models, most current policy recommendations employ market-based economic incentives (e.g. taxes). This paper employs a dual emotional-cognitive decision-making model to represent tourists' choices. This framework allows comparing the efficacy of taxing emission levels against non-market sustainability policies including: (1) environmental information labelling; (2) emotional communication messages, and (3) limiting time pressure marketing practices. A field experiment (N = 509) was used to test the effectiveness of both market- and non-market-based sustainability policies in reducing overall CO2 emission levels by affecting destination choice. It found that the sensitivity of the choice decision to price is overestimated if and when emotions are not considered in the choice context. Tourists' decisions can not only be guided by rational financial calculations but also by the interplay of their emotions or the “animal spirits” cited by John Maynard Keynes. Therefore, effective policies to change behaviour towards more sustainable practices in tourism can be induced by working through non-market interventions like shaping positive emotional messages (but avoiding negative ones) and limiting time pressure marketing techniques. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",behavioural change; CO<sup>2</sup> emissions; emotive marketing; Field experiments; sustainable tourism; tourist choice,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Factors influencing the choice of marketing channels: Evidence from dairy farmers in Thailand,Jitmun T.; Kuwornu J.K.M.,2019,10.1504/IJVCM.2019.099102,"This study assessed the factors influencing marketing channel choice of dairy farmers in Thailand using primary data obtained from 385 randomly selected dairy farmers in central and north-eastern regions of Thailand. Two types of farmers were surveyed: members of dairy cooperatives (DCs) and members of private organisations (POs) representing the two key marketing channels. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, and a binary probit regression model was used to examine the factors influencing farmers' decision regarding the choice of marketing channels. The study revealed that dairy farming experience, the number of years of membership in the milk collecting centres (MCCs), distance to the MCCs, milk price, payment period, access to market information, advisory service, credit service and farm input service had positive influence whereas marketing experience had negative influence on the choice of selling to the DCs.

Attitude toward smoking: The effect of negative smoking-related pictures,Grigaliunaite V.; Pileliene L.,2017,10.24136/oc.v8i2.20,"Research background: Endeavouring to develop healthy societies is a primary goal in many countries. As smoking is a major problem of public health, lowering the extent of smoking is one of the conditions for developing a healthy society. Based on the research revealing that the pairing of the product with negative stimuli enhances the possibility of negative reaction to the product as negative stimulus transfers it's meaning to the product, tobacco packaging was labelled with negative smoking-related pictures illustrating the danger of smoking. Nevertheless, the extent of smoking is still large in many countries. Hence, the effect of negative smoking-related pictures has been the subject of intense debate within the scientific community. Purpose of the article: The aim of this research is to determine the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. Methods: For the purpose of determining the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking, Implicit Association Test and questionnaire survey were provided. The questionnaire was elaborated based on the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. Findings & Value added: The theoretical analysis substantiated the influence of attitude toward the product on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, people do not always want to reveal their opinion, hence traditional marketing research methods for measuring explicit attitude are not sufficient as they are often not objective. Therefore, neuromarketing research methods complement traditional marketing research methods by providing more objectivity. Consequently, the Implicit Association Test and traditional questionnaire research are applied for the empirical research, revealing the effect of negative smokingrelated pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. The recommendations for the usage of negative smoking-related pictures on purpose to influence attitude toward smoking and consumer purchase behaviour are substantiated. © 2017 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

The role of mere closeness: How Geographic proximity affects social influence,Meyners J.; Barrot C.; Becker J.U.; Goldenberg J.,2017,10.1509/jm.16.0057,"Geographic proximity has become increasingly relevant due to the growing number of marketing services that use consumers' geographic locations, thus increasing the importance of gaining insights from this information. In five studies (both field and experimental), the authors analyze the effect of geographic proximity on social influence and demonstrate that not only social proximity but also perceived homophily can trigger social influence. They find that this effect holds under alternative representations of geographic distance and is confirmed for a range of different services and even for physical goods. Furthermore, the authors show that geographic proximity has a relative effect because the social influence of a closer sender is stronger than that of a more distant sender, regardless of the absolute distances. They present managerially relevant conditions under which the influence of geographic proximity not only is comparable to other types of information such as age or gender but also provides sufficient informational value for customers to offset differences among alternatives (e.g., due to higher prices) in trade-off decisions. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Geographic proximity; Homophily; Online reviews; Recommendations; Social influence,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation

Observations and video recordings of the decision processes of 24 couples were coded and analyzed. The time to final decision, number, and type of tactics used were found to vary with couples’ length of experience with one another. Observation indicated that couples with greater travel experience together relied on “predealing” based on their experience together to avoid conflict, while less-experienced couples’ decisions were more likely to yield winners and losers. These findings and those related to the use of persuasive tactics by members of the couple dyads provide the basis for specific recommendations for marketing travel products. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",couple’s negotiation; quasi-experiment; shared decision making; travel plan,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation
"The empirical model of trust, loyalty, and business performance of the dairy milk supply chain: A comparative study",Susanty A.; Bakhtiar A.; Jie F.; Muthi M.,2017,10.1108/BFJ-10-2016-0462,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence, price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dairy industry; Milk; Suppliers; Supply chain management; Trust,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Jewish Community Studies as Seen Through a Business Lens,Levine S.J.; Dranoff S.,2016,10.1007/s12397-016-9185-2,"As market researchers, we have spent the past 30-plus years addressing the questions that impact the success of organizations in the service and non-profit sectors. It should come as no surprise, then, that when we bring our business lens and thought processes to the field of Jewish community studies, we also bring methods, approaches, and outcomes that differ markedly from traditional studies. Even more important than our methods, however, is the marketing framework in which we position our Jewish community studies. As a result of our marketing mindset, we look at the issues Jewish communities wish to address, analyze the data, and then draw conclusions and recommendations based on our deep experience understanding buyer behavior, purchase decision-making, and the customer experience. With this article, we hope to shed light on a different way of thinking about Jewish community studies, stimulate healthy discussion about the relative merits of all approaches to the subject, and contribute to the strengthening of Jewish communities everywhere. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Business; Consumer behavior; Jewish community study; Market research; Marketing; Strategy; Survey,Springer Netherlands,scopus-recommendation
Consumers' perceptions of native advertisements: Exploring the impact of ethics and ad trust,Fischbach S.; Zarzosa J.,2019,10.5840/bpej201981584,"With the rapid growth of native advertising, there has been an increased interest to address ethical concerns and deception online. To address this concern, we look at the consumer's ethical efficacy toward native ads and we compare native ads (such as in-feed and advertorial) to banner ads. Results confirm that consumers trust native ads more than banner ads. Moreover, we uncover that consumers ethical efficacy (i.e., confidence in ethical decision making) affects their intention to share native ads through eWOM. However, consumer individual differences influence intention to share content online and trust in the native ads. We study the moderating effects of salience, using the fashion context, and its influence on ad trust and willingness to share through eWOM.

An environmentally conscious PSS recommendation method based on users' vague ratings: A rough multi-criteria approach,Song W.; Sakao T.,2018,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.092,"Many manufacturers are today striving to offer a large number of value-added PSSs (Product-Service Systems). The increased number of PSS hinders potential buyers from effectively discovering the most suitable PSS to satisfy their personalized requirements. To accurately find the needed or wanted PSS with lower search costs, it is effective to recommend suitable PSS solutions to the right buyers. However, service, a component of PSS, brings more subjective and imprecise information in acquiring users' preferences due to e.g. their different experience and knowledge on services. Moreover, the interactions within user's preferences are often omitted in previous methods, which may lead to inaccurate recommendation results. Therefore, to solve these problems, an innovative method for PSS recommendation is developed. This method explicitly takes into account the environmental aspect of PSSs in question so that a method user can be guided to select an environmentally superior alternative. In addition, rough DEMATEL (Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory) is proposed to manipulate the interactions of vague user preferences in multi-criteria weight determination. Furthermore, a rough collaborative filtering approach is developed to make PSS recommendation under vague environment. A case study of elevator PSS recommendation shows the feasibility and potentials of the proposed approach. Theoretically, the new method can produce more reasonable PSS recommendation results by considering the interdependencies between different recommendation criteria. In marketing practice, the method can suggest proposals of new offerings to customers in a proactive manner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",DEMATEL; Personalization; Product-Service System; Recommendation; Search cost,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
The analysis of marketing factors influencing consumers’ preferences and acceptance of organic food products—recommendations for the optimization of the offer in a developing market,Melovic B.; Cirovic D.; Dudic B.; Vulic T.B.; Gregus M.,2020,10.3390/foods9030259,"Considering the benefits of the organic production system, it is recognized as one of the main drivers of future economic development. However, the imbalance between demand and supply at the local market level represents one of the serious obstacles that prevents its future growth. Therefore, this article examines the key factors related to the main elements of the offer that have the strongest impact on consumer preferences and acceptance of organic food products. In that sense, organic product, price, distribution channel, and promotion are considered the main elements of the offer and are analyzed in this paper from the consumer preferences perspective. Further, this article provides insight into some of the sensory properties of the offer that are important to consumers. Finally, it gives recommendations for optimization of the offer on the organic food market based on the analysis of the influence of each of those elements (product, price, distribution, and promotion) on consumer acceptance of organic products and making purchasing decisions. The data were collected using a questionnaire, and analyzed using the structural equation model (SEM). The results revealed that price and promotion have the strongest impact on consumer acceptance and buying decisions. Further analysis revealed that attitudes towards organic food products, price/quality ratio, distribution barriers, and modern media as a promotion instrument are the factors that have the most significant impact on consumer perception and attitudes towards the available market offer. These findings can help producers and other decision makers to better understand what creates added value of the organic food products in consumers’ mind and therefore make an offer that is in line with their expectations and preferences, which is recognized as one of the main prerequisites for the acceptance and purchase of organic food products. © 2020 by the authors.",Consumer preferences; Market; Optimization; Organic food; Product acceptance; Sensory properties,MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,scopus-recommendation
Whereabouts devolution and collective forest management?,Hyde W.F.,2016,10.1016/j.forpol.2016.06.018,"Devolution in forestry generally refers to the transfer of some degree of central government authority to local responsibility. It commonly takes the form of recommendations by external advisors in developing country situations who encourage formally organized decision making by a local political community. This paper reviews the literature on local tenure, the summaries of case studies in forestry, and the broader history of experience with collectives and cooperatives with the objective of identifying the characteristic cases where some form of collective or community forest management might be successful. The paper identifies four cases. It concludes that, at some level, smaller groups of managers may cooperate in labor and capital intensive activities like fire control or harvesting, or in specialized activities beyond their personal expertise, activities like processing and marketing their products. Successful and sustainable community-wide collective enterprises seldom include agricultural or forest land—with the possible, and likely impermanent, exception of low-valued open access land beyond the perimeter of agricultural crops and managed forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Collective action; Community forestry; Devolution,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-recommendation
Ranking of choice cues for smartphones using the Best–Worst scaling method,Pinto L.; Kaynak E.; Chow C.S.F.; Zhang L.L.,2019,10.1108/APJML-01-2018-0004,"Purpose: The number of studies on the use of choice cues in the purchase decision of a smartphone does not appear to be extensive, given the size and rate of growth of the market. Surprisingly, it appears that no study of this type in the Chinese context has been undertaken. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach: Best–Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings: Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important. Findings due to gender, income and age difference were also analyzed and discussed for orderly decision-making purposes. Practical implications: The ranking of factors showing what choice cues consumers consider most or least important in a particular market helps practitioners to develop appropriate adaptation strategies for the market. The comparison of findings for gender, income and age difference can further help practitioners to devise various alternative marketing strategies for different market segments and identify underserved segments, if any. Originality/value: The BW scaling method, however, appropriate in ranking order of importance, had never been used in ranking choice cues of smartphone purchase. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of studies about ranking of choice cues on smartphone purchases in the Chinese context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Best–Worst scaling method; Buying decision process; Chinese context; Product attributes; Ranking of importance; Smartphone,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Evaluation and decision making in social media marketing,Keegan B.J.; Rowley J.,2017,10.1108/MD-10-2015-0450,"Purpose: As organisations are increasing their investment in social media marketing (SMM), evaluation of such techniques is becoming increasingly important. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to knowledge regarding SMM strategy by developing a stage model of SMM evaluation and uncovering the challenges in this process. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with 18 key informants working for specialist SMM agencies. Such informants are a particularly rich source, since they manage social media campaigns for a wide range of clients. An exploratory research was conducted and thematic analysis surfaced the key components of the SMM evaluation process and associated challenges. Findings: The SMM evaluation framework is developed. This framework has the following six stages: setting evaluation objectives, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying metrics, data collection and analysis, report generation and management decision making. Challenges associated with each stage of the framework are identified, and discussed with a view to better understanding decision making associated with social media strategies. Two key challenges are the agency-client relationship and the available social analytics tools. Originality/value: Despite an increasing body of research on social media objectives, KPIs and metrics, no previous study has explored how these components are embedded in a marketing campaign planning process. The paper also offers insights in the factors that make SMM evaluation complex and challenging. Recommendations for further research and practice are offered. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agency-client relationship; Digital marketing; Social media analytics; Social media marketing; Social media marketing evaluation,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

Eine systematische Übersichtsarbeit zu publizierten und wissenschaftlich evaluierten Lehrangeboten],Weißkircher J.; Koch C.; Dreimüller N.; Lieb K.,2017,10.3205/zma001114,"Objective: Conflicts of interests resulting from interactions with pharmaceutical companies are pervasive in medicine and can result in an undue influence on physicians’ decision-making. The objective of this systematic review is to analyze published and scientifically evaluated curricula for medical students and residents regarding such conflicts of interest. We begin by describing the covered topics and teaching methods; afterwards we analyze the quality of the curricula using the published data on their evaluations and comparing the content with content recommended for such curricula. Methods: We searched Pubmed, Psyclnfo, EMBASE, OECD, WISO, SOWI and googlescholar up to and including the 5th of September 2016. Publications describing curricula for residents or medical students on the topic of conflicts of interest in medicine and evaluating them for their effects on the participants’ learning were included. We analyzed the covered topics and the teaching methods used and compared them with recommendations by the American Medical Students’ Association (AMSA) and Health Action International (HAI). Results: The literature search resulted in 20 publications that fulfilled our search criteria. In five trials, a control group was used, in no trial the participants were randomized to intervention or control group. 16/20 published curricula primarily covered marketing strategies by pharmaceutical companies, especially the interaction with pharmaceutical sales representatives (PSRs). Most curricula only covered a limited number of topics recommended by AMSA/HAI. The most frequent teaching method was a group discussion, which was used in 18/20 curricula; all curricula used at least one interactive teaching method. The evaluation of the curricula was heterogeneous in results as well as design. Some publications described a change of attitudes toward a stronger skepticism regarding interactions with pharmaceutical companies. Four publications described improved knowledge, one publication described a change in behavior toward a reduction of the acceptance of gifts. Conclusion: The trials conducted to this date regarding curricula on conflicts of interests are methodologically flawed and the described curricula lack important topics beyond marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are no data so far on the sustainability of the courses’ effects on participants* behavior. It is therefore necessary to develop a model curriculum that covers a broader variety of topics and to evaluate it using a well thought-out methodology to create a foundation for the further improvement of teaching conflicts of interest in medicine. © 2017 Weißkircher et al.",Advertising as topic; Conflict of interest; Curriculum; Drug industry; Medical education; Medical/psychology students,Gesellschaft fur Medizinische Ausbildung,scopus-recommendation
Competitive analysis of social media data in the banking industry,Afolabi I.T.; Ezenwoke A.A.; Ayo C.K.,2017,10.1504/IJIMA.2017.085644,"Recently, most companies interact more with their customers through the social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter. This has made large amount of textual data freely available on the internet for competitive intelligence analysis, which is helping reposition more and more companies for better profit.

In order to validate such relationship, a systematic literature review with an end goal of closing the current gaps in knowledge with regard to the impact of social media on tourism in the Asia-Pacific region has been conducted. Design/Methodology – We performed a systematic search of relevant literature through various databases including Scopus, ScienceDirect and ProQuest. In total, 25 articles were taken into consideration in which the review protocol made use of specific techniques such as PRISMA. Approach – We conceptualized the differences and similarities in the Asia-Pacific tourism industry influenced by social media. Findings – As a contribution to knowledge and practice, we found that the usage of social media for tourism marketing purposes is strongly correlated to the tourism industry in many countries of the APAC region. However, it has not yet been generalized as a popular tool in other nations in the region. Originality of the research – This study provides practical and future recommendations concerning the influence of social media in the Asia-Pacific context that has become increasingly popular.

Motivations for participating in clinical trials and health-related product testing,Paco A.; Ferreira M.; Leal J.,2015,10.1177/1745790416650602,"The purpose of this research involves understanding individual motivations for volunteering in clinical trials and/or health-related product tests. Identifying the reasons leading to participation in clinical studies also ensures researchers are in a position to outline projects that benefit patients as well as predicting eventual barriers that might otherwise constrain their involvement. In this context, the paper seeks to reinforce the importance of marketing strategies for recruiting and retaining volunteers as well as gasping the most effective kind of approach (promotional, communicational, economic incentives, among others). This study is based on exploratory research, deploying a deductive method, bailing up statistical methods in order to identify the motivations influencing volunteers over healthcare related product test participation. The results reveal that participants attach high importance to health professional recommendations within the scope of their motivations for participating in clinical trials. The motivations related to logistical factors (such as time and location) prove relevant to helping in the process of clinical trial participation decision making as well as deciding on the preferred alternative incentives (discount coupons, vouchers, etc.). Participants consider that information provided in hospitals, clinics, and health centers encourages interest in clinical trial participation taking into account that these are studies in the health area and the information provided by these institutions, therefore, probably receives correspondingly greater credibility. © 2015 The Author(s).",Clinical trials; Communication strategies; Health-related product testing; Marketing strategies; Motivations,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Buzzing with disclosure of social shopping rewards,Coker K.K.; Smith D.S.; Altobello S.A.,2015,10.1108/JRIM-06-2014-0030,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the dilemma that is based on a decision to disclose or not to disclose social shopping rewards (SSRs), in an effort to enhance the effectiveness of social shopping. To protect consumers and guide marketers, emergent forms of online commerce on social media platforms warrant closer examination. One such form is social shopping, which combines social media and online shopping. To motivate word of mouth (WOM) through social signs of approval or endorsement of brands, marketers have typically relied on social shopping rewards (SSRs). It is not typical, however, for the reason behind the social endorsement to be disclosed, leaving the branded message open to multiple interpretations. Design/methodology/approach – The dilemma of SSR disclosures is presented in a marketing and public policy analysis, drawing from findings from theWOMliterature on disclosure, incentives, source credibility and on social media Disclosure Guidelines by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA). Based on this analysis and on an extension of the Dual Credibility Model, a conceptual model is proposed that shows how disclosure works through source credibility to produce positive social shopping outcomes. Findings – In addition to the conceptual model, recommendations are made for marketing research, practice and public policy. Of significance are proposed SSR Disclosure Guidelines that extend FTC and WOMMA guidelines for best practices in disclosures in social media. Originality/value – This paper represents pioneering research on the disclosure of SSRs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Marketing communications; Marketing ethics; Online consumer behavior; Retailing online; Social media marketing; Word-of-mouth marketing,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Speedy DSL corporation,Marcal L.; Tontz R.,2014,,"Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case concerns the pricing decision of a service firm, and the use of the appropriate economic model to analyze that decision. A comparison of price-elasticity and cross-elasticity of demand highlights the market structure in which the firm operates and thereby an understanding of how a price change will impact the firm's total profit. Secondary issues involve classifying the cost of the firm's business activities and allocating those costs by sales revenue. The case has a difficulty level of three and is intended for use in junior-level courses. It can be covered in three hours, including a class presentation by a student team. The case requires a minimum of nine hours of outside preparation by students. This case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course. The purpose of the course is to enable students to apply the knowledge they have gained in their lower-division, business core courses that include microeconomics, financial accounting, and managerial accounting. Specifically, the case incorporates the understanding of profit-maximizing pricing under monopoly and duopoly models of competition, how price and cross-elasticity of demand are interpreted, and how cost data can be organized for management decisions. Case Synopsis: Students view the case through Susan, a recent business graduate, who has struggled to find employment and lives with her parents. Susan is anxious to turn her paid internship into a job. She interns for a local, Internet service provider, Speedy DSL. Speedy has a profit margin that is below the industry average and faces strong competition from Timely Cable in the local broadband market. Currently, the two firms (Speedy and Timely) charge the same price for basic Internet connectivity that is similar in speed and reliability. Another Speedy intern, Matt, uses an estimated monopoly demand schedule and Speedy's own cost data to argue that Speedy should raise its price. Speedy's Marketing Director asks Susan for an evaluation of Matt's proposal. Susan has read industry reports with an estimate of the cross-elasticity of demand between DSL price and Cable subscriptions. Understanding that Timely's gain of customers would be Speedy's loss; students (placed into Susan's position) evaluate the impact of a price increase on Speedy's profit in a duopoly setting. Students must also categorize the cost of Speedy's business activities and show the breakdown of those costs against sales revenue. Instructor's Notes: Recommendation for Teaching: Approaches This case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course. The purpose of the course is to enable students to apply knowledge they have gained in the lower-division business core. In addition, the course aims to improve students' communication and teamwork skills. Student teams evaluate the issues presented in the case, perform the appropriate analysis, and recommend a course of action. All teams submit a formal, written business report containing their analysis and recommendations. One team of students formally presents their case analysis to the class. A second team of students acts as a ""discussion team"" by asking the presenting team for further explanation or clarification of their recommendations. Following the discussion team's exchange with the presenters, the entire class is welcome to participate in an active question and answer session. Although the case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course, the case can easily be modified for use as an in-class or take-home assignment in an introductory microeconomics course.",,Allied Academies,scopus-recommendation
Open book practices in buyer-supplier relationships in India,Kumra R.; Agndal H.; Nilsson U.,2012,10.1108/08858621211207225,"Purpose: This paper seeks to explore how Indian buying firms practise an open book (OB) policy in supplier relationships in three industries, i.e. the vehicle industry, the construction industry and the information technology industry. It also aims to study determinants of open book practices. Design/methodology/approach: Application of the OB policy is operationalised as the nature of open book practices, the extent and stage of data disclosed, the form of data disclosed, the direction of data disclosed, the attitude towards cost data disclosed, and the purpose and conditions of data disclosed. Determinants of the open book policy comprise characteristics of the exchange, the product, the buyer, the supplier and the supply market. Qualitative data were collected in the form of 22 interviews with representatives of three buying organisations and several of their suppliers in order to build three case studies. Findings: The results suggest that the OB policy is used by buyers for diverse purposes ranging from strategic to operational, for example value engineering at the product development stage, to ensure supplier margins, for self improvements and cost reductions, and country entry decisions. Similarly, the data shared ranged from narrow to wide in scope and scale. Suppliers' attitudes ranged from fairly neutral to very negative towards open books. Power asymmetries, the number of alternative suppliers, product performance characteristics and value, incentives offered, and buyer efforts were found to influence OB practices. Practical implications: Experiences gained from employing an OB policy in vehicle manufacturing suggests that firms in other industries can better leverage the use of open books for joint problem solving, equitable profit sharing and supplier selection. Originality/value: The paper highlights that an OB policy can have broader applicability than recognised by many past studies and indicates that it can serve purposes of strategic decision-making. It can also be an integrated part of a buyer's risk reduction strategy. Further, the study provides specific recommendations for Indian companies with regard to the application of an open book policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Buyer-seller relationships; Buyer-supplier relationships; Buyers; India; Open book policy; Relationship marketing,,scopus-recommendation
"Dynamic marketing budgeting for platform firms: Theory, evidence, and application",Sridhar S.; Mantrala M.K.; Naik P.A.; Thorson E.,2011,10.1509/jmr.10.0035,"Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this modelbased recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%. Further normative analysis sheds light on how crossmarket and carryover effects alter classical one-sided marketing budgeting rules. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Kalman filter; Marketing budgeting; Marketing dynamics; Twosided markets,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation

The case for professional boards: An assessment of Pozen's corporate governance model,Hemphill T.A.; Laurence G.J.,2014,10.1108/IJLMA-07-2012-0023,"Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a ""professional board"" of directors.

The role of demographics in patients' perceptions towards the quality of health care services provided at public hospitals in Damascus,Al-Khalil A.; Mahmoud A.B.,2012,,"The assessment of health care service quality is considered one of the important indicators utilized by decision makers in the process of enhancing and developing the quality of the health care services provided through hospitals. This study aims at assessing patients' perception towards the quality of health care services provided at the public hospitals affiliated to the Syrian ministry of health in Damascus. The results of (677) valid questionnaires revealed that patients had perceived positively the three dimensions of health care service quality which are: ""Health Care"", ""Health Personnel"", and ""Health Facilities"". It was also found that female lower educated patient would hold less positive perceived quality for the health care services than other categories of patients do.

Acquisition and strategic use of competitive intelligence,Yap C.S.; Abdul Rashid M.Z.,2011,,"This study investigates the current status of competitive intelligence (CI) practices in Malaysia, and how managers acquire and use CI from various sources. Data are collected through mail questionnaire survey from 123 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. More than half of the surveyed companies have a formal CI unit in their organisation. These units are mostly located within the marketing or market research or corporate planning department and has been established from 5 to 9 years. On average, 2 to 5 full-time personnel are assigned to take charge of CI activities. The top three sources managers acquire CI are newspapers and periodicals, the Internet and extranets, and customers. Whereas, the top three sources where CI is used in strategic decision making are customers, competitors, and newspapers and periodicals. In terms of source category, while the frequency of acquiring CI is higher from external impersonal sources, the frequency of using external and personal sources in strategic decision making is significantly higher than internal and impersonal sources.

The Methodology in Empirical Sales Ethics Research: 1980–2010,McClaren N.,2015,10.1007/s10551-013-1871-3,"The study examines the research methodology of more than 200 empirical investigations of ethics in personal selling and sales management between 1980 and 2010. The review discusses the sources and authorship of the sales ethics research. To better understand the drivers of empirical sales ethics research, the foundations used in business, marketing, and sales ethics are compared. The use of hypotheses, operationalization, measurement, population and sampling decisions, research design, and statistical analysis techniques were examined as part of theory development and testing. The review establishes a benchmark, assesses the status and direction of the sales ethics research methodology, and helps inform researchers who need to deal with increasing amounts of empirical research. The investigation identified changing sources of publication with the Journal of Business Ethics and the Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management maintaining their position as the main conduit of high quality empirical sales ethics research. The results suggest that despite the use of theoretical models for empirical testing, a greater variety of moral frameworks and wider use of marketing exchange theory is needed. The review highlights many sound aspects about the empirical sales ethics research statistical methodology but also raises concerns about several areas. Ways in which these concerns might be addressed and recommendations for researchers are provided. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Empirical; Ethics; Management; Managers; Marketing; Methodology; Methods; Personal; Research; Review; Sales; Salespeople; Selling; Theory,Kluwer Academic Publishers,scopus-recommendation
The effects of blogger recommendations on customers' online shopping intentions,Hsu C.-L.; Lin J.C.-C.; Chiang H.-S.,2013,10.1108/10662241311295782,"Purpose: Blogging has become part of a consumer's decision making process when shopping online; however, the understanding of blog recommendation's effect on consumer purchase decision is still vague. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the blog reader's trusting belief in the blogger is significant in relation to the perceived usefulness of the blogger's recommendations; and how the blog reader's perceptions influence his/her attitude and purchasing behavior online. The moderating effect of blogger's reputation on readers' purchasing intentions is also tested. Design/methodology/approach: Based on various theories, a model was proposed in this study. A survey involving 327 blog readers as participants was analyzed in the empirical study to investigate whether the usefulness of bloggers' recommendations and trusting beliefs toward blogger had influence on consumers' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward online shopping. Findings: The results indicated that perceived usefulness of bloggers' recommendations and trust had significant influential effect on blog users' attitude towards and intention to shop online. Moreover, the findings showed that different determinants affected the users of perceived-high-reputation and perceived-low-reputation blogs. Originality/value: The findings suggest bloggers' electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to be a promising marketing strategy for increasing sales. The marketers should provide free trial products and services to the perceived-high-reputation bloggers who, as valued opinion leaders, will influence and prompt others to shop online through a trusting effect. As for perceived-low-reputation bloggers, the marketing strategists should strive to emphasize the usefulness of products and services being marketed, so these perceived-low-reputation bloggers can focus more on describing the advantages and benefits of products or services discussed in their blogs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Blogging; Blogs; Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Online shopping; Recommendations; Reputation; Trust,,scopus-recommendation
When does retargeting work? Information specificity in online advertising,Lambrecht A.; Tucker C.,2013,10.1509/jmr.11.0503,"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Construal level theory; Field experiments; Online advertising; Online decision process; Retargeting,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation

Is unimpeded marketing for breast milk substitutes responsible for the decline in breastfeeding in the Philippines? An exploratory survey and focus group analysis,Sobel H.L.; Iellamo A.; Raya R.R.; Padilla A.A.; Olivé J.-M.; Nyunt-U S.,2011,10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.029,"Infant mortality and morbidity risk is linked to formula usage. The proportion of Filipino infant formula users rose 6% between 2003 and 2008. It is hypothesized this rise resulted from aggressive formula industry marketing.We conducted a household survey between April and December 2006 and focus groups in April-May 2007 in The Philippines to examine the association between mothers' exposure to advertising and other information sources and formula feeding decisions. Sixteen barangays (communities) were randomly selected from three purposively selected disadvantaged rural, urban and mixed municipalities. A total of 345 households had children under 24-months age: 114, 142 and 89 households from the rural, urban and mixed municipalities, respectively. In addition 38 respondents participated in 3 focus groups of 10-15 participants each, from three selected barangays.After adjusting for education and economic indicators logistic regression analysis showed that, children were more likely to be given formula if their mother recalled advertising messages, or a doctor, or mother or relative recommended it. Those using formula were 6.4 (1.8-23.1) times more likely to stop breastfeeding before 12 months. The focus groups described how television advertisements, doctors and medical representatives enticed them to use formula. We conclude that two factors were strongly associated with the decision to formula feed: self-reported advertising exposure, and physicians' recommendations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Breast milk substitutes; Breastfeeding; Formula feeding; International code; Marketing; The Philippines,,scopus-recommendation
The effects of choice in the classroom: Is there too little or too much choice?,Thompson M.; Beymer P.,2015,10.1111/1467-9604.12086,"Motivation is a subject that is constantly discussed in the field of education. Teachers are taught not only to teach their students, but to motivate them to want to learn. As students get older, intrinsic motivation tends to decrease; therefore it becomes more difficult for teachers to motivate students (Ryan and Deci, 2000a). According to self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci, 2000a, 2000b), students' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness must be met in order to experience positive social development and growth. When these needs are met, students experience high levels of self-motivation. Offering choice in the classroom is one way to increase student motivation by appealing to students' needs for autonomy and competence. In the fields of marketing, economics and social psychology, decision-making research is examined as a way to shape consumers' preferences. This literature review will aim to utilise and possibly translate some of these findings to an educational setting. By examining the aspect of choice in separate fields, it can be seen that there is still much to be researched in the field of education.

Searching in choice mode: Consumer decision processes in product search with recommendations,Dellaert B.G.C.; Häubl G.,2012,10.1509/jmr.09.0481,"This article examines how a common form of decision assistance- recommendations that present products in order of their predicted attractiveness to a consumer-transforms decision processes during product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in ""choice mode."" Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Behavioral search models; Consumer decision making; Product recommendations; Product search,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation
Evaluating promotional activities in an online two-sided market of user-generated content,Albuquerque P.; Pavlidis P.; Chatow U.; Chen K.-Y.; Jamal Z.,2012,10.1287/mksc.1110.0685,"We measure the value of promotional activities and referrals by content creators to an online platform of user-generated content. To do so, we develop a modeling approach that explains individual-level choices of visiting the platform, creating, and purchasing content as a function of consumer characteristics and marketing activities, allowing for the possibility of interdependence of decisions within and across users. Empirically, we apply our model to Hewlett-Packard's (HP) print-on-demand service of user-created magazines, named MagCloud. We use two distinct data sets to show the applicability of our approach: an aggregate-level data set from Google Analytics, which is a widely available source of data to managers, and an individual-level data set from HP. Our results compare content creator activities, which include referrals and word-of-mouth efforts, with firm-based actions, such as price promotions and public relations. We show that price promotions have strong effects but are limited to the purchase decisions, whereas content creator referrals and public relations efforts have broader effects that impact all consumer decisions at the platform. We provide recommendations as to the level of a firm's investments when ""free"" promotional activities by content creators exist. These free marketing campaigns are likely to have a substantial presence in most online services of user-generated content. © 2012 INFORMS.",Demand modeling; Online marketing; Two-sided markets; User-generated content,,scopus-recommendation

Modelling CRM in a social media age,Harrigan P.; Soutar G.; Choudhury M.M.; Lowe M.,2015,10.1016/j.ausmj.2014.11.001,"Customer relationship management is a continually evolving domain that has been particularly affected by social media, which have revolutionised the way businesses and consumers interact. This paper on social CRM builds on a previous model of CRM prior to the growth of social media (Jayachandran etal., 2005). We present a new model for social CRM, including a new construct of customer engagement initiatives and adaptations of other constructs to cater for the impact of social media. An online survey was used to collect data from a population of marketing practitioners and partial least squares analysis was used to test the model. Findings show the importance of an underlying customer relationship orientation; how it impacts on social media technology use and customer engagement initiatives, and also directly on customer relationship performance. A relationship is also shown between engagement and relational information processes, which is viewed as a performance outcome of social CRM. Thus, from a managerial perspective, one recommendation we make is that organisations should utilise the rich customer information that is created with every customer engagement through social media to drive future marketing decisions. © 2014 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.",Customer engagement; Customer relationship management (CRM); Information processes; Social media,Elsevier Australia,scopus-recommendation

Foster's was facing a common management problem: harnessing its portfolio of Beringer California Collection wines to increase profitability, improve its competitive position, and defend against a disruptive new entrant in the U.S. wine market called Yellow Tail. Category Optimizer combines the parsimony of an internal market structure with the advances that have been made in assortment planning in operations research, assortment and stock-keeping-unit-level modeling, mixed logits, and the marketing literature on the perceptions of variety of assortment to develop and estimate a model on readily available store scanner data. The model subsequently uses these results to inform strategic and tactical decision making. This approach led to recommendations that initially seemed counterintuitive; the normal response would be for Foster's to consider lowering prices to maintain share and volume, a strategy not inconsistent with many of the recommendations of past models. However, considering the additional degrees of freedom that a product range offered for defense, we demonstrated that a combination of price increases together with the introduction of a volume-flanker product in a new channel would improve profits, increase revenue, and protect and enhance market share. These were successfully implemented in early 2008, earning rich dividends for the company; increasing profitability by 70%, revenue by 3%, and earnings before interest and taxes by 8.5%; and having a positive impact on its brand ranking. In fact, in 2008, it debuted as sixth among the international wine brands. It also managed to play an important role in deposing Yellow Tail, the market share leader, from its dominant position. We conclude the paper by providing examples of other companies where this approach has also been successfully implemented and by discussing some avenues for future research. ©2013 INFORMS.",Assortment; Brand portfolio; Category management; Disruptive innovations; Internal market structure; Perception of variety,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-recommendation
Optimizable and implementable aggregate response modeling for marketing decision support,Albers S.,2012,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2012.03.001,"The methodological discussion on the calibration of aggregate marketing response models has shifted away from how to obtain usable input for optimization toward how to avoid biases in statistical estimation. The purpose of this article is to remind researchers that such calibration is performed either to support managers in their marketing-mix decisions or to create general knowledge that leads to a better understanding of marketing relationships and thus indirectly supports decisions. Both goals require response models that are optimizable. The models must also be implementable if actual decision support is the objective. Herein, I identify several aspects for which these requirements are not always fulfilled: First, the appropriateness of the chosen functional form of the marketing response models is rarely discussed, although different forms imply quite different optimal solutions. Second, endogeneity is taken into account by structural equations, even though we lack sufficient information on how managers reach their decisions. Third, estimation methods for response models are often evaluated based on goodness-of-fit, while an assessment of their usefulness for subsequent optimization is neglected. Therefore, I provide recommendations for improving the current practice by better specifying the response function and undertaking more simulation-based evaluations of the best estimation method for use in subsequent optimization. With respect to implementation, usability can be facilitated using spreadsheets and heuristics. Moreover, gaining generalizable and replicable knowledge requires better documentation of results, which can be achieved through providing elasticities and as many details as are necessary to replicate a study, thereby enabling faster learning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,,scopus-recommendation
Visa restrictions and their adverse economic and marketing implications - Evidence from China,Song H.; Gartner W.C.; Tasci A.D.A.,2012,10.1016/j.tourman.2011.05.001,"Governments spend considerable public resources, including tax dollars, on marketing their cities or countries in order to become a strong brand attractive for exports, foreign direct investment and tourism. Ironically at the same time, self-imposed and strict visa regulations that can potentially hamper the productivity of marketing and branding are fairly common. There are valid reasons for imposing strict visa regulations, two of the most important being national and economic security. Although strict visa regulations are a common phenomenon around the world, the tourism academia have yet to argue against strict visa regulations by providing empirical evidence on their potential impact on tourism demand, and hence the economy. The current study is a pioneer attempt to generate awareness about the potential detrimental impacts of visa restrictions on a country's economy, by using the case of People's Republic of China, one of the countries known to have a history of strict visa regulations. The research reported in this paper was based on the standard tourism demand function, which models the causal relationship between tourism demand and a number of macroeconomic variables. The autoregressive distributed lag model (ADLM) was used since it has a dynamic specification that takes the time path of the tourist decision-making process into consideration by using both current and lagged values of variables. Results show the negative effect of visa regulations on both country-level and prefecture-level economies.

This case is alsoappropriate for discussion in any courses where the instructor is ready to discuss ethics ininternational business and society. This case is designed to be taught in approximately one ortwo class sessions. Case Synopsis: This case describes the hypothetical management decisions Matt Lelander, a fictional marketing and purchasing manager of a British home improvement store, must make. The principle dilemma revolves around the choice of whether to continue purchasing lumber from the Latvian state owned lumber company. It has come to the attention of the purchasing manager, Matt Lelander that the rate of consumption of Latvian forests appears to be unsustainable. However, Matt realizes that the Latvian state lumber company is certified as a sustainable provider of lumber by the internationally recognized Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Mr. Lelander is acutely aware that his customers value purchasing lumber from sustainably harvested sources and that they rely on FSC certification when making their purchases. Further, Mr Lelander is presented some legally challenging issues with regards to contract performance and bribery. The case provides detailed background information on the Latvian state owned lumber company, FSC, the current situation of Latvian forests, applicable laws, ethical frameworks, and competitive market considerations.

The factors that induce Internet consumers to subscribe to brand accounts in social networks are the following: discounts, consumers' favourable attitude towards the brand, their personal interest in a brand, opinions and recommendations of their acquaintances, traditional advertising, media coverage, professional interest, social network posts. It has been found out that 57% of people in the developed countries do not want to contact with brands through social media. In the USA this number grows to 60%, in Great Britain to 61%. A barrier to advancement of brands through social networks in Ukraine is substantial. In our country almost half of all Internet consumers (49%) do not want companies or brands to contact with them. Although 54% of consumers in the world (47% in Ukraine) recognize that social networks are positioned correspondingly in order to get information about food; researches show that brands should care more about their online behavior.

Recommendations from a virtual community as a catalytic agent of travel decisions,Ku E.C.S.,2011,10.1108/10662241111139318,"Purpose: The research goal of this study was to determine how flow experience and perceived behavioral control (PBC) affect participation behavior in the backpackers' forum. Design/methodology/approach: Subjects were self-selected by placing messages on over five recommendations members in the backpackers' forum. In total, 2,000 invitation messages were mailed to members of the Taiwanese backpackers' forum, of which 435 were returned completed (a return rate of 21.75 percent). Findings: As our analysis, flow experience in a virtual community is positively associated with the behavioral intentions to use the virtual community. Perceived enjoyment in a virtual community is positively associated with the behavioral intentions to use the virtual community, and behavioral intentions to visit a virtual community are positively associated with the member's actual participation in a virtual community. Research limitations/implications: While this study has produced meaningful data for the development of multidimensional measures of factors that influence participation behavior in the Taiwanese backpackers' forum, the validity of an instrument cannot be firmly established on the basis of a single study. All of the data used for tests were collected only from a single backpackers' forum. Practical implications: Our study shows that travel agencies must become technologically astute to keep up with its customers, should be viewing the internet as a vital distribution channel for marketing, and should be linked to other well-known reservation web sites. Social implications: The backpacker community served as a reference group that could significantly influence travelers' beliefs, attitudes, and choices. Originality/value: In the present study we found that a basic understanding of the essence of the backpacker community is a prerequisite for any organization operating a travel-oriented community if they are to be clear about their mission, purpose, and the right direction to take to achieve their goal. That goal will increase the commitment of the members to a virtual community by increasing their helping behavior and active participation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Recommendations; Travel; Virtual worlds,,scopus-recommendation
Enhancing Poultry Industry Competitiveness: Consumer Perspective on Chicken Meat Quality Based on Sensory Characteristics,Imran S.N.; Kamarulzaman N.H.; Latif I.A.; Mohd Nawi N.,2014,10.1080/10454446.2014.921878,"The increasing demand for chicken meat has caused producers to increase their productivity through enhanced production techniques. Further increase in demand for quality meat products has been predicted in the country. This study seeks to investigate factors that influence consumer perception toward chicken meat quality. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 569 consumers at selected shopping malls located in Klang Valley areas. The majority of the respondents perceived quality as an important criterion for buying decisions. The finding revealed that nine factors have influenced consumer perception on meat quality, namely color, size, springiness, chicken aroma, fatty/oily taste, sweetness, visible fat, tenderness, and fibrousness. Among these factors, tenderness was found to be the most important criterion that influenced consumer preference toward chicken meat quality during buying decisions. Good production practices and proper marketing strategies are among recommendations to poultry industry players toward fulfilling consumer demand for good quality chicken meat. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",awareness; chicken meat; consumer; perception; quality,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
Analysing intra-destination movements and activity participation of tourists through destination card consumption,Zoltan J.; McKercher B.,2015,10.1080/14616688.2014.927523,"This study investigates tourist behaviour in the Canton of Ticino Switzerland, a geographically dispersed destination, by analysing use patterns of a ‘destination card’ sold by the local destination management organization. Destination cards offer free or highly discounted entry into partner attractions and activities often coupled with free public transport access in the area. Within this context, the study sought to determine if evidence of concentrated behaviour existed, either spatially or by activity. Cluster analysis revealed four discrete market segments. Three of them showed a high degree of spatial concentration in their movements, augmented by some clearly defined activity preferences. The fourth showed no clear pattern, travelling widely throughout the Canton and sampling a range of activities. Hence, the combination of transport and attractions’ entrance appeals to two different user groups, one looking to gain access to attractions and one seeking ease of transport. Discriminant analysis further supported the results with defining the determinant variables of the cluster membership and confirmed that the point of sales has an important role in identifying the consumption of activities and the extension of the area visited. Thus, to conceptualize the decision process in an intra-destination level, the spatial structure of the destination seems to play a greater influence on behaviour than its product structure. The paper illustrates how analysis of destination card data can assist destinations in better understanding their markets and discusses potential research opportunities that can generate real marketing benefits. A number of recommendations especially for destination managers and tourism operators are also identified to enhance the information gathered. Product bundling, regional cooperation and strategic marketing opportunities at sales points are suggested in this context to further incentivize tourist mobility. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",activity consumption; destination card; discriminant analysis; intra-destination movement patterns; segmentation; Ticino,Routledge,scopus-recommendation
"Unbranding: Threat to brands, opportunity for generics and store brands",Mayer P.; Vambery R.G.,2013,10.1108/07363761311304951,"Purpose: Marketers devote great efforts to maintaining brand value. However, brand value can come under attack in the absence of sufficient product performance and image differentiation in a process called unbranding. This paper aims to provide insights and guidelines that will give marketing managers tools to deal with variables that impact consumer decisions on whether to buy a national brand or a store brand product. Design/methodology/approach: A consumer research study was based on a random, mall intercept with 188 respondents consisting of seven questions scored on a ten-point scale. The results are presented on a set of graphs accompanied with some analysis of means (ANOM) applications. Findings: Results indicated that a significant portion of consumers (from over 40 percent to a high of 85 percent) feel that the quality differences between branded and generic products have diminished and the price premiums charged by branded products are often no longer justifiable. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study imply that in branded product premium image must be maintained and enhanced, otherwise it will be lost. In addition, the trend of brand value loss referred to as unbranding will vary significantly by and within a product category. Practical implications: Branded products must maintain their superior consumer perception and product performance. Store or generic brand marketers should exploit the favorable price-value relationship gained because of the loss of brand value through a process of store branding. Originality/value: The new concept of unbranding is introduced together with research-based recommendations for brand value protection strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Brand identity; Brand values; Differentiation; Generics; Price-to-value; Store brands; Unbranding,,scopus-recommendation
Assessing the moderating effect of consumer product knowledge and online shopping experience on using recommendation agents for customer loyalty,Yoon V.Y.; Hostler R.E.; Guo Z.; Guimaraes T.,2013,10.1016/j.dss.2012.12.024,"Social media technologies have greatly facilitated the creation of many types of user-generated information, e.g., product rating information can be used to generate preference-based recommendation. As a decision support tool, a Recommendation Agent (RA) has been widely adopted by many e-commerce websites. The impact of RAs on online shopping has been extensively examined in the IS literature. However, from Marketing and Social Media perspectives, the widely adopted cognitive-affect-conative-action framework of customer loyalty has not been tested in the presence of RAs. Moreover, there has been little research assessing the impact of increasing consumer knowledge about specific product domains on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Based on these important constructs, this study proposes and empirically tests a parsimonious model assessing the moderating effect of consumer product knowledge and online shopping experience on using RA for customer loyalty. The results show that consumer product knowledge relationship between RA's recommendations negatively impacts the recommendation quality and customer satisfaction, however, consumer online shopping experience does not have a significant effect on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The results make a significant contribution to a better understanding of the constructs in our research model and provide evidence useful for the management of websites using RAs for product recommendations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction with website; Customer value; Intelligent agents; Online shopping experience; Product knowledge,,scopus-recommendation
The social embeddedness of decision making: Opportunities and challenges,Takac C.; Hinz O.; Spann M.,2011,10.1007/s12525-011-0066-y,"Sociologists have long recognized that economic decisions are socially embedded. Management sciences and business practices have gradually begun to incorporate this idea. With the rise of the Internet, large-scale data are available on friendships, recommendations, transactions and social interactions, which have led to a strong momentum for research in this area. The aim of this article is to inspire multidisciplinary research on the mechanisms and consequences of social embeddedness on decision making and to highlight opportunities and challenges by synthesizing findings from various fields, such as IS research, sociology, economics, marketing and other management disciplines. Key suggestions of this paper are to identify the causality between social embeddedness and decision making with small-scale experiments, and to learn more about network formation by analyzing the evolution of social networks. © 2011 Institute of Information Management, University of St. Gallen.",Consumers; Decision making; Diffusion; Experiments; Organizations; Social network analysis,,scopus-recommendation
Student engagement and marketing classes,Taylor S.A.; Hunter G.L.; Melton H.; Goodwin S.A.,2011,10.1177/0273475310392542,"A study is reported that investigates the goals underlying undergraduate students' engagement in their major classes, nonmajor classes, and in extracurricular activities. The qualitative study employs both focus groups and goal-mapping exercises. The results suggest that students tend to focus on utilitarian, attribute-level considerations mainly related to credentialing for purposes of employment. The results are considered from the perspectives of judgment and decision making, learning models, and the emerging service marketing perspective. These model considerations underscore an argument for moving toward models of education delivery focusing on value co-creation instead of the current emphasis on providing value to students. A series of recommendations are offered to help facilitate faculty efforts to increase course engagement, particularly in large-section course offerings. However, the authors ultimately conclude that student engagement with their course-related experiences will best be served in models of value co-creation by a focus on more than intellectual maturity in education. Specifically, an argument is presented for also targeting moral and motivational maturity. The practical and research implications of the study are presented and discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.",class size; goal mapping; marketing; maturity; student engagement,,scopus-recommendation
The effects of marketing communication on the tourist's hotel reservation process,Almeida N.M.; Silva J.A.; Mendes J.; do Valle P.O.,2012,10.1080/13032917.2012.687690,"The paper analyses the tourist's first stay booking decision and the factors (such as advertising, word-of-mouth, and travel agency recommendation) that most significantly influence it. Three research hypotheses have been considered and a logistic regression model has been specified. The factors ""advertising"" and ""word-of-mouth"" have significant power to explain direct-contact booking. Hence, there is not only a strong association between first stay booking and the Web, but also a very strong association between the booking and the recommendation of someone close to the tourist who has previously stayed at the hotel. This means that these are two important sources of information for inducing the tourist's decision in this respect. The research contributes to both the understanding of the first stay booking decision-making process and the management of the hotel marketing communication media plan. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",Advertising; Booking; Marketing communication media; Word-of-mouth,,scopus-recommendation
Category captain arrangements in grocery retail marketing,Chimhundu R.; Kong E.; Gururajan R.,2015,10.1108/APJML-08-2014-0124,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine shelf management practices of grocery retail chains and their category captains (CCs) in the marketing of consumer packaged goods. Design/methodology/approach – This is a qualitative, exploratory study that is set in a duopoly retail environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The study employed 18 in-depth interviews with executives and managers of two umbrella retail organisations and their suppliers/manufacturers. The method of data analysis employed was content analysis. Findings – Despite CC input in merchandising decisions, it is the retail chains that have the final say on shelf matters. There is no risk of strategic loss of power in employing CCs to manage store product categories on behalf of, or in partnership with retailers provided the retail chains closely monitor the activities and decisions/recommendations of the captains. Research limitations/implications – The paper is developed from data obtained from the grocery retail industry of one economy. Future research would need to extend this study to other economies with similar as well as different conditions. Practical implications – The research offers reassurance to grocery retail practitioners who may be contemplating lessening the burden of managing all their store categories by themselves and switching to CC arrangements. The reassurance is that the reported risk associated with loss of power is manageable. Originality/value – The paper has created a typology termed the “category captain arrangement/grocery retail concentration matrix” and specific directions for further research. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Asia Pacific; Category captain; Consumer goods; Grocery retail; Marketing; Power,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Consuming direct-to-consumer genetic tests: The role of genetic literacy and knowledge calibration,Pearson Y.E.; Liu-Thompkins Y.,2012,10.1509/jppm.10.066,"As direct-to-consumer marketing of medical genetic tests grows in popularity, there is an increasing need to better understand the ethical and public policy implications of such products. The complexity of genetic tests raises serious concerns about whether consumers possess the knowledge to make sound decisions about their use. This research examines the effects of educational intervention and feedback on consumers' genetic literacy and calibration-the gap between consumers' actual knowledge and how much they think they know. The authors find that consumers' genetic knowledge was generally low and that people tended to underestimate their knowledge level. Furthermore, consumers' perceived rather than actual knowledge levels drove attitude and purchase intention. Regarding the effect of educational intervention, exposure to an online educational module improved both genetic knowledge and calibration. Offering instant feedback resulted in greater knowledge gain than delayed feedback. The worst learning outcome occurred when feedback was both delayed and brief. On the basis of these findings, the authors offer recommendations for formulating ethically sound public policies in this area. © 2012 American Marketing Association.",Direct-to-consumer marketing; Genetic literacy; Genetics education; Knowledge calibration; Marketing ethics,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation
Online shopper reviews: Ramifications for promotion and website utility,Ong B.S.,2011,10.1080/10496491.2011.597304,"Today's consumers are empowered with online shopper reviews which are mostly written and posted by buyers, customers, users, or visitors at a website. Shopper reviews will become more popular and ubiquitous in e-tailing in the near future. However, the marketing literature is still limited when it comes to knowledge of how shoppers perceive and use online reviews in their purchase decisions. Hence, this study explored shoppers' predispositions toward positive or negative reviews and examined the impact of consumers' attitudes and usage patterns on their perceived helpfulness and credibility of online shopper/peer reviews. One interesting finding from our study of 342 online shoppers was that consumers who would pay greater attention to positive reviews gave reviews more credible and usefulness ratings than their counterparts who would focus on the negative reviews. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Consumer recommendations; Online shopper reviews; Online word-of-mouth; Perceived credibility; Product reviews; Website promotion,,scopus-recommendation
Self-gift giving: Understanding consumers and exploring brand messages,Heath M.T.; Tynan C.; Ennew C.T.,2011,10.1080/13527260903236898,"This article addresses self-gift giving both from a consumer perspective and from the point of view of brands' promotional messages. Self-gifts may be regarded as personal acquisitions which are distinguished from other purchases by a particular motivation and context - quite literally, gifts to oneself. Our knowledge of this phenomenon from the consumer side remains limited, despite evidence of its importance in understanding consumer decisions. Furthermore, there is no empirical research addressing the extent to which organisations make use of the concept of self-gifts in their marketing activities. This paper addresses these gaps using a two-stage methodology. First, it enhances the understanding of self-gift consumer behaviour (SGCB) by 14 in-depth interviews with consumers. Then, drawing on the self-gift themes which emerged from the interviews, it presents the results of a content analysis of marketing communications for two selected product categories. The combined methodology offers new and rich insights into the theoretical understanding of self-gift consumer behaviour and provides recommendations for practitioners differentiating their marketing communications. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Content analysis; Promotional messages; Self-gift consumer behaviour,,scopus-recommendation

Bundle Building in the Arts: An Experimental Investigation,Darveau J.; d'Astous A.,2014,10.1002/mar.20720,"Within the arts and culture sector, bundling is a commonly used strategy that consists in marketing a combination of products in a single package. Drawing from current examples in the arts and culture industry, the study presented in this article examines how different bundling strategies affect consumer decisions and perceptions. An experiment was conducted among a sample of 200 adult consumers where the complementarity of bundle items (complementary vs. noncomplementary) and mode of selection of bundle items (additive vs. subtractive) were jointly manipulated by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Consistent with previous research, the results showed that consumers who construct an arts and culture bundle in a subtractive fashion end up with a greater number of items and a more expensive bundle. However, the impact of mode of selection on the bundle's perceived value was shown to depend on the complementarity of the items. These findings suggest that the recommendation of avoiding bundling noncomplementary products usually put forward in the bundling literature must be evaluated through a consideration of the type of strategy that is used to build the bundle. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Wiley-Liss Inc.,scopus-recommendation
GranuLab (C): internationalizing GranuMaS,Adham K.A.; Said M.F.; Muhamad N.S.; Sarkam S.F.; Senik Z.C.; Isa R.M.,2012,10.1108/20450621211320524,"Subject area: The area of focus is on internationalization strategies, specifically on developing suitable strategies to support an internationalization initiative of a new medical device company. Study level/applicability: This case is designed for final year undergraduate and MBA students. It is suitable for courses of organizational management, organization theory and design, strategic management, and international business as well as international marketing. Case overview: GranuLab, a medical device company that produced the synthetic bone graft substitute GranuMaS, aspired to be a high-growth company. To achieve this aspiration the company had made plans for internationalization, which include penetrating the ASEAN, Middle East, Latin American, and African markets within the next five years. By December 2010, GranuLab had completed the construction of its new manufacturing facility in Shah Alam, about 30km from Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur. This manufacturing facility had the capability to produce high volumes to support the company's high growth plan. However, the company's internationalization processes had taken longer than expected and this has led to a low business volume. By mid-2012, the company was forced to make a quick decision as it had suffered a year and a half of operations losses. GranuLab had to formulate a strategy as to how to position GranuMaS and penetrate the targeted markets. Failure to internationalize would incur even greater losses and might hinder the achievement of its high growth aspiration by 2015. Expected learning outcomes: This case is designed to stimulate case analysts' thinking into providing recommendations for the appropriate internationalization strategies to be adopted by the management team to ensure that the company could succeed in achieving its goals. The case will expose students to the concepts and theories of strategic management, international business, international entrepreneurship; and facilitate the development of students' abilities to apply those concepts in managerial situations.

Competently ordinary: New middle class consumers in the emerging markets,Kravets O.; Sandikci O.,2014,10.1509/jm.12.0190,"Although the new middle classes in emerging markets are a matter of significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, there has been little systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological sensibilities informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these sensibilities are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class sensibilities, which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These sensibilities crystallize into a particular mode of consumption - ""formulaic creativity"" - which addresses consumers' desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies.

Conceptualization of experience marketing in the sector of hospitality services,Verbauskiene L.; Griesiene I.,2014,,"Marketing experience is a new area, yet little examined marketing theorists and practitioners. However, the recent period has increasingly focused on the concept of experience marketing and its practical application.

In order to reveal the conceptualization of experience marketing in the hospitality services sector, was made extensive theoretical studies of experience/experiential marketing and hospitality sector. This article presents the theoretical model of experience marketing in the hospitality services sector, which consists of two structural components: 1. reflects the client/guest experience levels and types as well as the activities of company; 2. the customer/guest behavioural consequences (results), which depends on what kind of experience customers receives. Model specification and theoretical analysis of the study showed that the hospitality service companies should use the experience marketing tools, because the main task of companies providing hospitality services is to make a customer become a steady visitor/customer, since his/her decisions and actions will depend in the future on his/her ""positive"", ""unforgettable"", ""unique"" experience while facing with service provider or brand.",Experience; Experience marketing; Experiential marketing; Sector of hospitality,Vilnius University,scopus-recommendation
Determining consumers' discount rates with field studies,Yao S.; Mela C.F.; Chiang J.; Chen Y.,2012,10.1509/jmr.11.0009,"Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover, the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Discount rate; Dynamic structural model; Forward-looking consumers; Identification; Pricing; Three-part tariff,American Marketing Association,scopus-recommendation

Homo economicus and social marketing: Questioning traditional models of behavior,Carvalho H.C.; Mazzon J.A.,2013,10.1108/JSOCM-11-2011-0080,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to bring forth the limitations of some important models of cognition and behavior adopted by social marketers and present important findings from recent lines of research that contribute to a fine-grained understanding of human behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that presents a review of several theoretical approaches to human cognition and behavior and their implications regarding social marketing campaigns. Findings: It is concluded that the assumptions underlying traditional models of behavior need to be revised, especially the assumption that human beings are rational decision makers - the prototypical homo economicus. Behavioral science has revealed that people are far from being rational and are prone to be influenced by myriad factors, some deemed irrelevant under rational models. Social marketing interventions have greater probability of success when they rely on more realistic assumptions of human behavior. Research limitations/implications: Social marketing needs to embrace the contributions of the several disciplines and lines of research centered on the study of all facets of human behavior, such as behavioral economics and dual-system framework. Practical implications: The main implications are: the recommendation to assume people are running on their System 1 when they are in contact with social marketing campaigns, the need to consider the interplay of systems and selves over time, the recommended emphasis on place strategies, and the need to avoid cash incentives and silver bullets. Originality/value: The value of this paper is in contrasting the assumptions of traditional models of cognition and behavior widely used in social marketing with the evidence from several lines of research portraying influences in human behavior not accounted by those models. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Cognition; Consumer attitudes; Consumer behaviour; Social marketing; Social marketing theory; Theory of planned behaviour,,scopus-recommendation
The shoppes at riverside,Carter F.L.; Heriot K.,2010,,"Case Description: This case asks the students to recommend a decision to a group of individuals on whether or not to pursue purchasing The Shoppes at Riverside, even when the purchase price is minimal ($1). It is based on the actual experiences of one of the authors. The Shoppes at Riverside is a unique business located in a historic building in a downtown area. The store occupies approximately 5,500 square feet of space (leased from a local foundation) and subleases space to dealers selling upscale merchandise including art, antiques, home accessories, and gift items. The store charges a monthly rent to each dealer (based on their booth square footage) along with a 10% commission on sales. The students are given basic information provided by the present owner and are asked to evaluate the information given to project monthly cash flows and then to make a recommendation to the potential purchasers. They are also asked to evaluate and suggest other lines of business that might be added to the present business to increase the profitability of the store. This case is appropriate to use in an Intro to Small Business Class as the size of the business is ideal for any course that emphasizes entrepreneurs or small businesses. This assignment can be completely individually or as a group assignment. Case Synopsis: The primary focus of the case is a purchase decision. The information given to the students to utilize in formulating their decision includes store sales by month for each of the last three years as well as operating expenses. From the information given, the students are asked to construct pro- forma cash flows for the year 2007 by month based on their assumptions regarding sales and occupancy levels. They are also asked to research other product lines the potential buyers could add to the store to complement the present merchandise presently being sold by dealers. Although the store does collect rental income, there is a cap on percentage rents at 10% of sales which in turn limits the total revenues of the store. The students are given some ideas on lines of business to research within the questions of the case. They may have others they would also like to research. A second phase of the case analysis would be to break the case into group assignments and have each group research and prepare presentation on such topics as (1) the various type of advertising options and the related costs applicable to small retail businesses in order to develop and implement a marketing plan; (2) the type of business formation available to small businesses (i.e. Corporation, Sub-S Corporation, Partnership, LLP; (3) additional product lines to add to increase revenues of the business; and (4) the advantages and disadvantages of developing a website and selling ""on-line"" with this type of business. As a result of the individual and group projects, classroom discussions could be held based on the findings of the groups as well as other current issues faced by small businesses. The advantage of this case is that it presents students with a real-life purchase decision and presents relevant topics for in-class discussions.",,,scopus-recommendation
EU organic logo and its perception by consumers,Zander K.; Padel S.; Zanoli R.,2015,10.1108/BFJ-08-2014-0298,"Purpose-With the introduction of the mandatory European Union (EU) organic logo for all organic food products in 2010, the European Commission aimed at fostering the internal organic food market. This needs consumers’ knowledge of the logo. According to earlier research consumers’ knowledge of the EU organic logo is low. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to elicit consumers’ attitudes towards organic certification and labelling and to develop recommendations on how to improve consumers’ knowledge of the EU organic logo. Design/methodology/approach-By means of an online survey with 3,000 participants in six European countries, knowledge of the logo and attitudes towards organic farming and European labelling, as well as organic food purchase behaviour and socio-demographic indicators were elicited. Factor and cluster analysis based on several statements on the test persons’ attitudes towards organic farming and corresponding EU legislation were conducted in order to segment consumers. Findings-The results indicate that knowledge of the logo is low. Only about 15 per cent of all respondents knew its meaning. Four clusters of consumers could be identified: “Committed organics”, “Pragmatic organics”, “Organic sceptics” and Organic disinteresteds’. With reference to the EU organic legislation’s aim of promoting the organic market, particularly “Organic sceptics” should be addressed by emphasising the trustworthiness of the organic certification and labelling system. Originality/value-Segmenting consumers according to their attitude towards organic farming, its labelling and certification allows for targeted and efficient communication and organic market development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Attitude-behaviour discrepancy; Communication; Consumer attitudes; Consumer purchasing decisions; Organic marketing; Product information,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
"The influences of sales compensations, management stringency and ethical evaluations on product recommendations made by insurance brokers",Tseng L.-M.; Kang Y.-M.,2014,10.1108/JFRC-08-2012-0031,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the impacts of the size and timing of sales compensations, the management stringency of the insurer and the insurance broker's own moral views on product recommendations made by the brokers. Design/methodology/approach – The data used in this research were gathered from life insurance broker companies in Taiwan. Findings – The results showed that the sales compensations, perceived leniency of the insurer's underwriting and claim policy would affect the product recommendations made by the brokers. Practical implications – Insurance brokers are one of the most important marketing channels in the insurance industry. However, using the insurance brokers to sell insurance may result in some ethical problems. For example, some insurance brokers may sell insurance to high-risk customers because the high-risk customers may prefer to buy more insurance and that means more sales compensations can be earned. The findings of this research may have some implications for insurance management and insurance regulation. Originality/value – This study contributes to the understanding of insurance brokers' responses to adverse selection problems (high-risk customers may prefer to buy more insurance) and product recommendation decisions.

Barriers of marketing effectiveness and efficiency within companies: A qualitative study,Karlíček M.; Chytková Z.; Tyll L.; Mohelská H.,2014,10.15240/tul/001/2014-4-009,"Market orientation can be defined as the company’s ability to systematically generate relevant information about current and latent customer needs, spread this information across all company departments and use this information in decision making and subsequent behavior. Current research proves that market orientation correlates strongly with profitability. Strengthening market orientation should therefore be the main focus of the marketing department. However, over the last years, marketers within companies have faced serious criticism coming from the top management as well as from other business functions. This criticism stems from the generally shared opinion that marketing expenditures tend to rise whereas marketing effectiveness and efficiency seem to decline over time, as proved by relatively low satisfaction and loyalty levels of customers and their resistance towards marketing activities. This study investigates the main barriers of marketing effectiveness and efficiency within companies. Based on two focus groups with senior Czech marketing managers we revealed several key themes that reflect how local marketers perceive their jobs. We identified that marketing departments differ diametrically in activities they execute, that marketers face image problem within their companies and that they are not able to prove return of their activities sufficiently. Furthermore, we individuated barriers specific for our context not found in the literature. However, companies of different size and sectors have specifics which are discussed in the text. Managerial recommendations are added. All of these findings should be of high importance for both CEOs (resp. owners) and marketers, because increasing effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing function is their common goal. ©, 2014, Technical University of Liberec.

Bloggers' reported tourist experiences: Their utility as a tourism data source and their effect on prospective tourists,Volo S.,2010,10.1177/1356766710380884,"The present study evaluates the value of tourists' blogs as a research data source by using them to evaluate the tourist experience and to assess their influence on the decision-making process of prospective tourists. The blogs of 103 tourists visiting South Tyrol, 32 written in English and 71 written in Italian, were analyzed using textual and image content analysis. The text of 246 comments posted to these blogs was analyzed to evaluate the possible influence of bloggers' narrative on prospective tourists. The results show cultural differences in the way tourists use blogs. Italian blogs appear to have more potential to influence the decision-making process of prospective visitors since their comments often contain recommendations and authors' declaration of their own future intentions to travel to South Tyrol. They also demonstrate significant potential for revealing market-relevant aspects of tourists' experience although they do not always convey the 'experience essence'. © The Author(s) 2010.",blogs; destination marketing; Italy; South Tyrol; unobtrusive research methods; user generated content,,scopus-recommendation
The organizational impacts of managing social marketing interventions,Polit S.,2012,10.1177/1524500412450491,"Since social marketing's formal introduction in 1971, the field has advanced through employing innovations in marketing thought. Despite debates over whether or not marketing principles should be used to promote socially beneficial behaviors, the field has become successful at utilizing such practices to achieve its goals. However, even with these advancements, social marketing research has yet to fully consider how the use of traditional marketing practices in socially oriented settings can alter the way stakeholders perceive and interact with the organizations employing these tactics. This article examines how parallels between nonprofit management and social marketing research illustrate how socially oriented organizations can damage their legitimacy as change agents and community partners by not evaluating the true costs of employing marketing techniques. Both warnings and recommendations are provided to help the managers of social marketing efforts more effectively evaluate both the costs and benefits of their decisions. © The Author(s) 2012.",Best practices; Monitoring and evaluation; Partnerships,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation

At the end of 2010, Internet users in China reached 420 million. However, online shopping in China is not widely practiced and organisations investing in B2C online shopping need to understand the factors that affect Chinese consumers' online buying behaviour. This research develops a theoretical research model as a framework to identify the key decision factors influencing Chinese consumers' to shop, or not to shop online. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather information from 435 respondents in Beijing, China. The empirical analysis identifies and ranks seven important decision factors: perceived risk, consumer resources, service quality, subjective norms, product variety, convenience, and website factors. All of these decision factors impact on Chinese consumers' adoption of online shopping.

The nexus of knowledge and behavior for school-aged children: Implementation of health education programs and a nutritional symbol system,Miller J.; Graham L.; Pennington J.,2013,10.1080/18377122.2013.836771,"Health-related knowledge has been assumed to inform lifestyle choices for school-aged students. A ‘health-promoting school’ provides the conceptual framework for this intervention. A large boarding school developed, implemented and refined a Nutritional Symbol System for their dining hall. The effectiveness of this social marketing strategy and school-based Health Education Program was evaluated by interviewing students (n = 16) for nutritional knowledge and application of the Nutritional Symbol System (NSS) to food choices in a range of contexts within (for example, in the dining hall and canteen) and beyond the school. In-depth interview data were collected, recorded and analyzed manually and via the Leximancer text mining software.

An analysis of the potential target market through the application of the STP principle/model,Kampamba J.,2015,10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n4s3p324,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to establish and identify the target market of a proposed residential development in Gaborone using the STP strategy. Research design/methodology/approach - Both non-probability and probability sampling techniques were used by applying qualitative and quantitative research methods (interviews and questionnaire) were used to get research data in order to meet the objective of the study. A survey instrument using a self-administered questionnaire was developed and administered to the respondents who were working earning a monthly salary was used in order to meet the minimum qualifying criteria for a home loan being 30% of one's income to service mortgage payments. Significance - The study is relevant to developers who just develop/invest scarce resources without establishing the need/demand for the product. It will be a lesson learnt for those developers who shun/disregard the input of market research in the process of decision making for housing property development. Findings - The study established that this was the first research of its kind within the housing market. It also revealed that target market identification is critical in market research because it help the developer to minimise the unsystematic and systematic risks which might affect the success of the development project thereby impacting on the profitability of the business. It will also help them appreciate by positioning the product in the minds of the target market through offering the product with features that the customers are looking for. From the developer's point of view, they will be fulfilling the customer's needs by implementing the recommendations and results of the market research report. Once these needs are met and fulfilled, the property listing period is also reduced at the time of marketing the property and customers are identified even before the propduct is developed thus adding value to the business. Originality/value - Based on the key findings, recommendations are made in this paper to improve the market take-up rate through the application of STP analysis. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

The effect of pharmacists on drug purchasing behavior of price-sensitive consumers,Ricks J.; Mardanov I.,2012,10.1177/1745790412445799,"The present study empirically investigates how much pharmacists' recommendations and consumer decisions influence the marketing of drugs to price-sensitive consumers. The results indicate that consumers rely on physicians and their own decisions than pharmacists' recommendations in choosing prescription drugs. Consumers rely more on pharmacists' recommendations in purchasing over-the-counter drugs. To reveal the relationships among physicians, pharmacists, and consumers, pharmacists and consumers were surveyed using existing questionnaires. The findings indicate recommendations from pharmacists' that patients consult with physicians about the choice of lower priced, though acceptable, prescription and over-the-counter drugs have a significant effect on consumer decisions. Pharmacists indicated that they were willing to recommend low-cost alternative drugs. Consumers were willing to follow pharmacists' recommendations.

To Switch or Not To Switch: Understanding Social Influence in Online Choices,Zhu H.; Huberman B.A.,2014,10.1177/0002764214527089,"The authors designed and ran an experiment to measure social influence in online recommender systems, specifically, how often people's choices are changed by others' recommendations when facing different levels of confirmation and conformity pressures. In this experiment, participants were first asked to provide their preference from pairs of items. They were then asked to make second choices about the same pairs with knowledge of other people's preferences. The results show that other people's opinions significantly sway people's own choices. The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) rather than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions. Finally, the time people spend making the first decision significantly predicts whether they will reverse their decisions later on, whereas demographics such as age and gender do not. These results have implications for consumer behavior research as well as online marketing strategies. © 2014 SAGE Publications.",conformity theory; social influence; social media and choices,SAGE Publications Inc.,scopus-recommendation
Shavteli Winery: where to go from here?,Gilinsky A.; Trela B.,2011,10.1108/20450621111186200,"Title: Shavteli Winery: where to go from here? Subject area: International marketing, national competitiveness, strategic decision‐making, wine. Study level/applicability: Undergraduate and MBA. Case overview: The nationally important Georgian wine industry by 2008 was in a deep recession due largely to the continuing 2006 Russian wine embargo, prior to which Russia had been the largest export market for Georgian wines. Second World War‐era Georgian wineries such as Shavteli (disguised), in the historic Racha‐Lechkumi wine‐producing region, were disadvantaged due to aging facilities, lack of tourist infrastructure, and inadequate capital to make needed changes to compete in the global markets for emerging economy wines. All nearby wineries faced continuing operating deficits, high inventory levels, and could lose much of their aging wine inventory to oxidation if they could not quickly sell more wine or convert the wine to brandy. To avert becoming another defunct producer, Shavteli needed a strategy. Industry observers were divided about whether Shavteli and its sister Georgian wineries should continue operating independently, seek government support, or form a marketing association to create new export demand. Students need to prepare a strategic plan for Shavteli and the Georgian wine industry. Expected learning outcomes: Students should develop well‐supported recommendations for competitive strategies in an emerging economy. Students should use strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and country competitiveness analyses to ascertain vision and mission, segmentation, targeting, positioning, and alliance strategies for international markets.

Is sustainable lumber a myth? The case of latvian timber industry,French J.J.; Martin M.,2012,,"CASE DESCRIPTION: The primary subject matter for this case involves strategic management, sustainability, international law, and business ethics. Firm positioning as an environmental leader represents a growing strategic trend. Incorporating sustainable business policies is a practice that many stakeholders are demanding. With these concepts in mind, this case is most appropriate for discussion and analysis in undergraduate management, business law, or ethics courses where the topics of leadership, management, ethics, and sustainability are covered. This case is also appropriate for discussion in any courses where the instructor is ready to discuss ethics in international business and society. This case is designed to be taught in approximately one or two class sessions. CASE SYNOPSIS: This case describes the hypothetical management decisions Matt Lelander, a fictional marketing and purchasing manager of a British home improvement store, must make. The principle dilemma revolves around the choice of whether to continue purchasing lumber from the Latvian state owned lumber company. It has come to the attention of the purchasing manager, Matt Lelander that the rate of consumption of Latvian forests appears to be unsustainable. However, Matt realizes that the Latvian state lumber company is certified as a sustainable provider of lumber by the internationally recognized Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Mr. Lelander is acutely aware that his customers value purchasing lumber from sustainably harvested sources and that they rely on FSC certification when making their purchases. Further, Mr Lelander is presented some legally challenging issues with regards to contract performance and bribery. The case provides detailed background information on the Latvian state owned lumber company, FSC, the current situation of Latvian forests, applicable laws, ethical frameworks, and competitive market considerations. At the end of the narrative the reader is asked to formulate ethically and strategically sound recommendations.",,,scopus-recommendation
Forming an intention to act on recommendations given via online social networks,Matook S.; Brown S.A.; Rolf J.,2015,10.1057/ejis.2013.28,"Online social networks (OSN) are technology-enabled relationship tools in which a user creates a profile, connects to other individuals, and shares user-generated content with them. One of the many features OSN offer is the ability to post messages in the form of product and service recommendations. Although word-of-mouth research has examined this type of personal communication to intentionally influence consumer decisions, limited understanding exists regarding when a user acts upon a recommendation received from one of their contacts. In this study, we draw on relationship theories and research on trust to analyze the impact relationship characteristics and behaviors of the OSN contacts have on trust in the recommendation that subsequently leads a user to act on this OSN contact's recommendation. The results of a survey of 116 OSN users showed that closeness, excessive posting behavior, and past recommendation experience have a positive impact on trust and intention to act on the recommendation. One characteristic of the relationships, that is, similarity, however, does not affect recommendation trust in the context of OSN. The findings enhance our understanding of relationships and their defining characteristics in OSN. The results also provide insights into how companies might leverage OSN in their marketing efforts. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.",,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Patient values and preferences when choosing anticoagulants,Palacio A.M.; Kirolos I.; Tamariz L.,2015,10.2147/PPA.S64295,"Background: New oral anticoagulants have similar efficacy and lower bleeding rates compared with warfarin. However, in case of bleeding there is no specific antidote to reverse their effects. We evaluated the preferences and values of anticoagulants of patients at risk of atrial fibrillation and those who have already made a decision regarding anticoagulation. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of Veterans in the primary care clinics and the international normalized ratio (INR) laboratory. We developed an instrument with patient and physician input to measure patient values and preferences. The survey contained a hypothetical scenario of the risk of atrial fibrillation and the attributes of each anticoagulant. After the scenario, we asked participants to choose the option that best fits their preferences. The options were: 1) has better efficacy at reducing risk of stroke; 2) has been in the market for a long period of time; 3) has an antidote to reverse the rare case of bleeding; 4) has better quality of life profile with no required frequent laboratory tests; or 5) I want to follow physician recommendations. We stratified our results by those patients who are currently exposed to anticoagulants and those who are not exposed but are at risk of atrial fibrillation. Results: We approached 173 Veterans and completed 137 surveys (79% response rate). Ninety subjects were not exposed to anticoagulants, 46 reported being on warfarin, and one reported being on dabigatran at the time of the survey. Ninety-eight percent of subjects stated they would like to participate in the decision-making process of selecting an anticoagulant. Thirty-six percent of those exposed and 37% of those unexposed to anticoagulants reported that they would select a medication that has an antidote even if the risk of bleeding was very small. Twenty-three percent of the unexposed and 22% of the exposed groups reported that they would prefer the medication that gives the best quality of life. Conclusion: Our study found that patients who may be exposed to an anticoagulation decision prefer to actively participate in the decision-making process, and have individual values for making a decision that cannot be predicted or assumed by anyone in the health care system. © 2015 Palacio et al.",Atrial fibrillation; Bleeding risk; Medication selection; Oral anticoagulant; Patient decision making; Warfarin,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Managerial applicability of graphical formats to support positioning decisions,Cornelius B.; Wagner U.; Natter M.,2010,10.1007/s11301-010-0061-y,"Issues of segmentation and positioning have always been at the heart of marketing management. In recent years, much methodological progress has been made in order to carry out these two tasks simultaneously, that is, to combine certain types of clustering algorithms with appropriate multidimensional scaling or unfolding procedures. When trying to provide managers with a tool to support marketing decision-making in segmentation and positioning, the ease of use and the visual quality of results must be emphasized. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of alternative graphical formats designed to assist strategic management. It focuses on three aspects, namely, (I) representing competitive market structures, (II) illustrating preferences for product attributes, and (III) describing customer heterogeneity at the individual as well as segment-specific levels; this paper also explores the interrelations among these aspects. The benefits and limitations of different approaches are discussed, and graphical examples are provided. Advances in academic research are contrasted with the information requirements of marketing managers. Finally, recommendations on the applicability of these alternatives for practical use are offered, and issues for further research are specified. © Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Austria 2010.",Graphical formats; Managerial applicability; Multidimensional scaling; Positioning; Segmentation; Targeting; Unfolding,,scopus-recommendation
Key success factors for obtaining a one Tambon One Product Food five-star rating in Phatthalung and Songkhla provinces,Noknoi C.; Boripunt W.; Lungtae S.,2012,,"The main purpose of the research is to study the key success factors for obtaining a One Tambon One Product (OTOP) food five-star rating, in terms of the characteristics of the community enterprise: management, marketing, production, product development, financial management and agency support. Data was collected from both the presidents and the customers of community enterprises in Phatthalung and Songkhla provinces whose products were selected as five-star food products of the OTOP project in 2011. In-depth interviews were used to collect data from 13 presidents of community enterprises. For consumers, 260 consumers (a group of 20 customers from each community enterprise) were selected to be the sample, and data was collected by both interview and questionnaire. Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data while means, standard deviation and percentage were used to analyse the quantitative data. In terms of management functions, most of the entrepreneurs carry out all management functions: planning, organizing, leading and controlling. On planning, the majority of the managers do all the planning for the enterprise. On organization, all responsibilities are divided between the staff according to their rates of pay. The president of the community enterprise leads the business. Morale has been built up to motivate the staff, and conflict has been eliminated within the operation. Monitoring the activities of the members, and training given by the organization itself or by a third party, were used as part of the controlling function. In terms of marketing, the majority of entrepreneurs focused on a marketing plan for distribution and promotion. They paid great attention to the quality of the product, and the price was set by considering relevant factors. Customers were attracted by various means, and the products were distributed at a place which was convenient for consumers to access. Sales promotions and advertising were used for the promotion mix. Competitors also sell similar products. In terms of production, the entrepreneurs used local raw materials from local or nearby suppliers under long-term contracts. Products were produced on demand using standard technology along with labour. Product quantity was fixed with the customer order. Most products were certified by the food agency. In order to enhance customer choice, most entrepreneurs have developed new products. In term of finances, most of the entrepreneurs have a financial plan in which the initial finance came from the owner or the president of the group. Working capital was allocated and the account was managed. Dividends were shared between all members, and the businesses have no outstanding debt. In terms of support, most of the enterprises were supported by government agencies, and only one enterprise was supported by a private agency. The main problems of production were the uncertainty of nature, the inadequacy of raw materials, delays in production during high season, the product reaching its expiry date, and a shortage of labour. The results from consumers indicated that the taste and cleanliness of the product were the factors that impact on their buying decision when the purpose of buying was to consume the product oneself. More than fifty per cent of customers bought the products more than twice. The purchasing motivation was the consumption of the product. The level of product satisfaction of the consumers was very high, while the levels of satisfaction with price, place and promotion were high. The recommendations are that the community enterprise should have 1) explicit planning of its operation, 2) a clear organization and allocation of responsibilities, 3) short and long term planning, 4) an emphasis on product development, 5) effective production planning, and 6) systematic accounting. Moreover, 7) the government should have a policy which practically supports the OTOP entrepreneurs.",,,scopus-recommendation
The role of brand orientation in the higher education sector: a student-perceived paradigm,Casidy R.,2013,10.1108/APJML-06-2013-0069,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between perceived brand orientation (PBO), satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour in the Australian higher education sector. Design/methodology/approach – Two hundred and fifty-eight questionnaires were completed by undergraduate students of a particular university in Australia. Structural equation modeling was employed in this study to examine the associations between the constructs. Findings – This study provides empirical evidence that PBO has a positive and significant relationship with all dependent variables. The research reveals that students' perception of a university's brand orientation is significantly related to satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour. Research limitations/implications – The findings may guide the key decision makers in higher education institutions to understand the importance of brand orientation in their corporate strategy to enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and positive WOM, which can be used to differentiate themselves from other institutions in the highly competitive education market. Originality/value – Past researchers have not looked into the dynamic relationships between PBO, satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour, and hence research is to be called for in this area.

Brand-building website design for independent hotels: A replicated model,Nassar M.; Abdou S.H.,2013,,"This paper aims to explore the opportunities that online marketing has to offer and contribute towards small independent hotels in view of the recent decline in hotel brand loyalty. This decline has been fuelled by consumer trends for ‘getting their money’s worth’ and the ability for the small or medium-sized hospitality establishments to reach consumers via Web Based Marketing Strategies. This has narrowed the competition gap with larger international hotel chains considerably. The paper includes a study which identifies the features of hotel websites that are essential to the building and structure of an effective hotel website. The six key elements identified in this paper are accessibility, information, credibility, e-commerce, customer relationship and immediacy. The reliability and validity of this six-element framework as a reflection of user requirements was ‘derived’ and established using empirical data from a survey. These six elements are established factors in granting online customer satisfaction and gaining customer loyalty. An important or crucial sector covered by this study is the Guest User Interface (GUI) of websites (accessibility). It has proven to be evident that attractive, easy to use or a user friendly interface is vital to keep consumers on the site without navigating them to another site long enough to make decisions. The conclusion of this paper is that independent hotels must leverage this opportunity by establishing a strong Web presence and capitalize on other sideline recommendations which include collaborations with third-party booking sites (such as Hotels.com) and developing informative, feature-rich websites of their own. © Mohamed Nassar, Sherif Hassan Abdou, 2013.",Branding; Hotels; Replicated model; Websites,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,scopus-recommendation
International student destination choice: The influence of home campus experience on the decision to consider branch campuses,Wilkins S.; Huisman J.,2011,10.1080/08841241.2011.573592,"Previous research has found that the country and institution choices of international students are greatly influenced by recommendations they receive from others who have experience of undertaking higher education overseas. For Western universities, it is of utmost importance to satisfy their international students, who can then encourage the next generation of international students to attend those same institutions. However, student satisfaction is not the only factor at play. Using a framework of 'push and pull' factors, rooted in the international student choice literature, this exploratory study investigates the determinants of destination choice of international students who decided to study at a university in the UK and examines their attitudes toward international branch campuses.

The role of sunk costs in online consumer decision-making,Liang A.R.-D.; Lee C.-L.; Tung W.,2014,10.1016/j.elerap.2013.10.001,"Sunk costs, which can cause inconsistencies between consumer behavior and economic theory, have been widely studied in different research areas and among various consumer groups. Nevertheless, the authors found that to date there has been no empirical research examining how sunk costs affect consumer behavior with regard to online shopping in different product types. Therefore, this study used the following 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design to study the effects of sunk costs on consumers' online shopping decisions. The results show that (1) sunk costs have significant effects on consumer online shopping behavior. However, due to the different product characteristics, the impacts were weaker effective when consumers bought search goods than when they purchased experience goods; (2) the sunk costs (Membership fee vs. Deposit) of an initial choice and a new choice had interaction effects on consumer intention to purchase a new product; and (3) the sunk costs and service quality of an initial choice and new choice would affect the level of regret felt with regard to the consumer's initial choice. In addition, some recommendations on market positioning and service quality design are made, which practitioners can refer to when formulating marketing strategies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to add to knowledge on consumer shopping behaviour through mobile devices by exploring attitudes to the use of mobiles in shopping, the use of mobile phones at different stages in the consumer decision-making process, the impact of involvement on the mobile consumer decision-making process and mobile shopping location. Design/methodology/approach: An online panel survey was conducted with a UK panel of nationally representative consumers. The survey collected data in respect of the following products that were ranked on level of involvement on the basis of the importance and effort consumers' associated with their purchase: bread (lowest), washing powder, DVD, footwear, phone and TV (highest). Findings: Use of mobiles for shopping is significant, but remains lower than use of computers in shopping. In general, respondents were more positive regarding their use of computer shopping than they were in relation to their use of a mobile. In using their mobile phone in shopping, respondents value its convenience and accessibility. There is higher use of the mobile phone in the information search and consideration of alternatives phases, than in the purchase transaction. The extent of use of mobile devices in the decision-making process is higher with higher involvement products, in relation to all stages in the decision-making process. The most frequent location for the use of their mobile in shopping is at home, which is consistent with the finding that the highest level of use of mobiles occurs in the information search and consideration of alternatives phases.

Promoting obesity prevention together with environmental sustainability,Skouteris H.; Cox R.; Huang T.; Rutherford L.; Edwards S.; Cutter-Mackenzie A.,2014,10.1093/heapro/dat007,"There is mounting evidence that current food production, transport, land use and urban design negatively impact both climate change and obesity outcomes. Recommendations to prevent climate change provide an opportunity to improve environmental outcomes and alter our food and physical activity environments in favour of a 'healthier' energy balance. Hence, setting goals to achieve a more sustainable society offers a unique opportunity to reduce levels of obesity. In the case of children, this approach is supported with evidence that even from a young age they show emerging understandings of complex environmental issues and are capable of both internalizing positive environmental values and influencing their own environmental outcomes. Given young children's high levels of environmental awareness, it is easy to see how environmental sustainability messages may help educate and motivate children to make 'healthier' choices. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a new approach to tackling childhood obesity by tapping into existing social movements, such as environmental sustainability, in order to increase children's motivation for healthy eating and physical activity behaviours and thus foster more wholesome communities. We contend that a social marketing framework may be a particularly useful tool to foster behaviour change beneficial to both personal and environmental health by increasing perceived benefits and reducing perceived costs of behaviour change. Consequently, we propose a new framework which highlights suggested pathways for helping children initiate and sustain 'healthier' behaviours in order to inform future research and potentially childhood obesity intervention strategies. © The Author (2013).",Children; Environmental sustainability; Obesity prevention; Social marketing,Oxford University Press,scopus-recommendation

Another area of interest falls under the need for enabling broadband policies and strategies that address existing geographic disparities. These motivating factors shaped this research and provided a basis for defining three specific objectives, namely: (1) to identify locations with or without broadband access, (2) to identify underserved rural and inner-city markets, and (3) to determine whether university and community college towns can be used in the adoption and dispersion of broadband technologies in southern Illinois. Supply-side and demand-side data were collected and inputted into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Supply-side data included cable modem, digital subscriber lines (DSL), wireless, and fiber optic lines, while demand data included reported broadband requests from individuals without access (n = 439), students (n = 45,866), and higher education workforce (n = 5419). Using the GIS and statistical techniques, insightful maps of broadband infrastructure were created to illustrate areas of supply and demand so that governments and businesses can address existing gaps in consumer needs. Specifically, different levels of broadband access and use were mapped; different under-served rural and inner-city markets were identified so as to emphasize the dramatic economic impact on the business opportunities available to small business entrepreneurs. Also, different geographies of use and accessibility of broadband connectivity in the study region were synthesized to support decision-making. The resulting maps provided supply and demand marketing intelligence based on the geographic analyses of residential and enterprise sectors. These data can be used as a model to develop specific policy recommendations for a knowledge-based economy, specifically for the southern Illinois region or other rural communities in the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Broadband; Digital divide; GIS; ICT; Spatial analysis,,scopus-recommendation
Differences in decision-making criteria towards the return on marketing investment: A project business perspective,Smyth H.; Lecoeuvre L.,2015,10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.03.005,"Assessing the value of marketing to a business remains a thorny issue in theory and practice. Decision-making at the finance-marketing interface is under-researched, particularly for project businesses. Confronted by demands of accountability concerning the allocation of resources to meet competitive pressures, the paper examines the quality and extent of dialogue in investment decision-making. The return on investment (ROI) and marketing-specific investment (ROMI) are important factors at the marketing-finance interface. ROMI/ROI is examined from quantitative and qualitative viewpoints. The empirical evidence shows that short-term financial criteria dominate and are misaligned to long-term performance of project businesses and business units. Marketing investment in relation to project markets poses a particularly challenging environment. Client lifetime value and programme data sets for ROMI coupled with qualitative decision-making offer ways forward with constructive dialogue at the finance-marketing interface. The paper concludes with detailed recommendations for research and practice. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Decision-making; Dialogue; Finance; Marketing; Performance; ROMI,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
Referral equity and referral management: The supplier firm's perspective,Hada M.; Grewal R.; Lilien G.L.,2010,10.1108/S1548-6435(2010)0000007008,"From the supplier firm's perspective, a referral is a recommendation from A (the referrer) to B (the potential customer) that B should, or should not, purchase from C (the supplier firm). Thus, as referrals are for a specific supplier firm, they should be viewed as part of the supplier firm's marketing and sales activities. We recognize three types of referrals - customer-to-potential customer referrals, horizontal referrals, and supplier-initiated referrals - that have critical roles in a potential customer's purchase decision.We develop the concept of referral equity to capture the net effect of all referrals for a supplier firm in the market. We argue that supplier firms should view referral equity as a resource that has financial value to the firm as it affects the firm's cash flows and profits. We offer strategies firms can use to manage referrals and build their referral equity and suggest a research agenda. Copyright © 2010 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,scopus-recommendation
Consumer reactions to professionals who use decision aids,Palmeira M.; Spassova G.,2015,10.1108/EJM-07-2013-0390,"Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate consumer reactions to professionals who use decision aids to make recommendations. The authors propose that people react negatively to decision aids only when they are usedin place ofhuman expert judgment. When used in combination with expert judgment, decision aids are not perceived negatively and may even enhance service evaluations. Design/methodology/approach – Three online experiments are presented. Participants indicated their perceptions regarding the recommendation strategy of professionals and their impressions of these professionals using one of three strategies: one based on expertise only, one based on decision aids only and a combination of the two (hybrid approach). Both within and between-subjects designs were used. Findings – Contrary to previous research that has found a negative reaction to professionals who use decision aids, the authors fnd that consumers actually appreciate these professionals, as long as the use of decision aids does not replace expert judgment. The authors also fnd that when people are given the opportunity to compare a pure expert judgment approach with a hybrid approach (decision aid in combination with expert judgment), they prefer the latter. Research limitations/implications – Although fndings should extend to various contexts, this research is limited to the three contexts examined and to the type of use of decision aid described. Practical implications – It has signifcant practical implication,as decision aids have been shown to improve decision accuracy, but previous research had indicated that consumers view these professionals in a negative way. The current research more clearly delineates the situations under which negative reactions are likely to occur and makes recommendations regarding circumstances in which reactions are actually quite positive. Originality/value – Reactions to professionals using decision aids have been investigated outside the marketing literature. However, this is the frst work to show that consumers actually have positive reactions to professionals using decision aids, as long as they do not replace expert judgment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Decision aids; Experimental design; Professional recommendations; Service encounter,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
Decision Quality Measures in Recommendation Agents Research,Aksoy L.; Cooil B.; Lurie N.H.,2011,10.1016/j.intmar.2011.01.001,"Electronic recommendation agents provide a way for online marketers to gather information about consumer preferences and assess the quality of consumer decisions. Much of the literature on recommendation agents, however, employs divergent measures to assess consumer decision quality. Moreover, decision quality measures are dictated by the type of agent employed. This article provides a review of the decision quality measures used in the recommendation agent research to date and proposes novel measures. We classify and examine the assumptions of-and relationships among-preference-dependent, preference-independent, and subjective measures of decision quality. The analysis of data from an experiment that simulates a broad spectrum of recommendation agents shows that the relative utility and the sum of attribute values of the chosen alternative capture the majority of variance in objective decision quality. Although subjective decision quality measures turn out to be poor proxies for objective measures, they provide important incremental information. Managerial implications for deploying electronic recommendation agents to gather information and measure consumer decision quality under different conditions are discussed. © 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.",Decision making; Decision quality; Measurement; Online; Preferences; Recommendation agents,,scopus-recommendation

Can automated group recommender systems help consumers make better choices?,Hennig-Thurau T.; Marchand A.; Marx P.,2012,10.1509/jm.10.0537,"Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the ""right"" one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Agents; Group decisions; Hedonic products; Joint consumption; Recommender systems; Social relationship quality,,scopus-recommendation
The emergence of electronic word-of-mouth as a marketing channel for the digital marketplace,Sharma R.S.; Morales-Arroyo M.; Pandey T.,2011,,"This study investigates the contribution of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to the sales of music albums. We conducted an empirical investigation of twenty-two music albums for a period of eleven consecutive weeks. eWOM was identified as an uncertainty-reducing element in consumer decision-making. Generally, the research hypotheses were partially supported using a multivariate linear regression model. We also found a stronger correlation between some eWOM channels and sales compared to other channels. eWOM has traditionally been considered an un-structured and ad-hoc source of sentiment. Our results suggest that eWOM generated in social networking when analysed appropriately is a fairly reliable predictor of market success. It is effective as a tacit suggestion, recommendation, or referral element with viral network effects. The intended contribution of this work is in identifying eWOM as a significant information contributor in the digital marketplace.",Digital economy; E-business uncertainty; Latency window; Music albums; Music distribution; Social media; Word of mouth marketing,,scopus-recommendation
Country-of-origin (COO) brand preferences and associated knowledge levels of Japanese wine consumers,Bruwer J.; Buller C.,2012,10.1108/10610421211253605,"There has been no significant research undertaken in the Japanese market on wine knowledge level and its relationship with brand loyalty and preference for specific country-of-origin (COO) wine brands. This exploratory study seeks to investigate these aspects and how wine knowledge is acquired and used in buying decisions. A highly structured, self-administered questionnaire in the Japanese language was used to collect data over a three-week period. Data include consumers from six of the eight major regional divisions across Japan. The sample population was female-weighted with moderate levels of education and medium income. A ten-item objective wine knowledge scale was developed to measure consumers' knowledge levels and to form the basis for segmentation. Japanese wine consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge were shown to use more intrinsic cues than extrinsic cues in their purchase decisions, with the importance attributed to intrinsic cues increasing as objective knowledge increases. The study showed consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge do not use the COO cue more than consumers with lower knowledge. Wine consumers view taste, variety and price as the most important buying cues and are influenced by the recommendations of people around them. This research provided insights into the Japanese wine market and the nature of the Japanese wine consumer. It is recommended that wine exporters focus greater marketing efforts on Japanese women, including greater wine education. This study is of value to academic researchers, wine educators, industry practitioners such as restaurant owners/sommeliers and wine exporters alike, as it provides insights into the direction and extent of COO preferences and hence wine (country) brand loyalty. It has a specific focus on wine knowledge and the educational aspect thereof highlighting how this can be used for the benefit of stakeholders. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Brand loyalty; Brand preference; Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Japan; Market segmentation; Objective knowledge; Subjective knowledge; Wines,,scopus-recommendation

"Do links matter? An investigation of the impact of consumer feedback, recommendation networks, and price bundling on sales",Hu N.; Tian G.; Liu L.; Liang B.; Gao Y.,2012,10.1109/TEM.2010.2064318,"Link structures among items within an E-commerce Web site can be regarded as a potential recommendation that helps new consumers quickly locate relevant products. In this paper, combining a modified version of Googles PageRank method with economic analysis of word of mouth, we investigate whether a products position within a network composed of recommendation links is incrementally informative about its future sales. Based on data from Amazon.com, we document that with consumer word of mouth and other product characteristics controlled, the position of a product within a recommendation network does influence consumers purchase decisions, and models incorporating link structure have a higher incremental predictive power of future sales than models without. In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context. Our results show that compared to general Internet surfing behavior, consumer consumption on Amazon is less random. We conclude that even though the product position within a recommendation network does influence customers purchase behaviors, product sales are still mainly driven by their own product characteristics. © 2012 IEEE.",Collaborative-filtering cross sale; marketing strategy; online word of mouth (WOM); PageRank; price strategy,,scopus-recommendation
This blog brought to you by … exploring blogger perceptions of a product endorsement policy and reviews,Walden J.; Bortree D.; DiStaso M.,2015,10.1108/JCOM-08-2013-0065,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how a change to a US policy about product testimonials affected bloggers and to understand bloggers’ perceptions of the organization-blogger relationship (OBR). Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes a survey (n=173) with closed and open-ended questions, and both quantitative and qualitative data are analyzed. Findings – Bloggers’ decisions to accept compensation for a review may influence how much control they feel they have over the OBR. Qualitative data indicate that even as bloggers seek access to products to review, they prefer to maintain editorial control over the review process. Research limitations/implications – The study extends the transparency literature in public relations and relationship management theory by exploring the relationship between bloggers and public relations professionals through the lens of a disclosure policy. Practical implications – Recommendations are offered for public relations professionals in how to maintain transparent relationships with bloggers. Social implications – Qualitative data reveal concern among bloggers about efforts to persuade them and what they should disclose; this may impact the trust that consumers have in reviews at blogs. Originality/value – The study demonstrates the effects of review behaviors on the OBR and offers an organic explanation of how this relationship evolves. This is important as consumers are increasingly consulting blogs for product information. This issue also has relevance to public relations professionals, who are encouraged to broach the issue of transparency with bloggers. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communications; Electronic media; Ethics; Information media; Public relations; Relationship marketing,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-recommendation

For the purpose of illustrating the series of steps involved in conducting such investigations, a six-country study examining global consumer culture positioning (GCCP) is presented. The suggested steps are relevant for the exploration of a wide variety of marketing- and advertising-related topics. Methodology/approach - Steps essential to a well-planned research design are addressed in detail, including: theory identification, stimuli selection, hypotheses formulation, measurement development, country selection, fictitious ad development, survey design, cross-national data equivalence, and hypotheses testing. Particular attention is given to construct specification (in this case for soft-sell and hard-sell advertising appeals) and fictitious ad development. General consumers in six countries responded to the ads. Specific procedures for validating formative constructs and testing their cross-country equivalency are suggested. Findings - The chapter provides practical recommendations for conducting cross-cultural research. These recommendations are likely to prove useful to both researchers conducting multicountry investigations, and to instructors teaching graduate-level courses in international marketing and advertising research. Originality/value of paper - Multicountry research requires a series of challenging decisions. Although a well-planned research design is particularly essential in a cross-cultural setting, little attention has been given in providing researchers and instructors with methodological recommendations.

The pharmacist's role in the Egyptian pharmaceutical market,Taher A.; Stuart E.W.; Hegazy I.,2012,10.1108/17506121211243068,"Purpose: Pharmaceutical companies' marketing strategies have traditionally targeted only physicians and, more recently, consumers. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the pharmacist as prescriber, influencer, switcher, and dispenser of pharmaceutical drugs in one developing country, Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: The authors surveyed pharmacists in Cairo, Egypt. The pharmacists were asked to estimate the percentages of patients who came in with a prescription, with only a box or a recommendation for a medicine and with only symptoms, and whether he/she switched the patient to another medicine. Pharmacies were classified as to the social class of the pharmacy neighborhoods. Cluster analysis was used to further classify pharmacists as ""Influencers"" and ""Non-influencers"". Findings: Overall the pharmacists influence 39 percent of all purchase decisions for pharmaceuticals with higher levels of influence in lower social class neighborhoods. Approximately one out of four pharmacists was classified as an Influencer. Practical implications: In developing countries, the pharmacist plays a key role in which medicines patients ultimately purchase. Marketing activities directed toward the pharmacist may provide an important opportunity to maximize the pharmaceutical firms' return on marketing investment. Originality/value: Few studies have looked at the marketing of pharmaceutical drugs in developing countries. This paper is unique in that it examines the role of the pharmacist in these markets, thus providing an important addition to the understanding of the challenges to the industry in these countries and important implications for pharmaceutical marketing strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Developing countries; Egypt; Expert power; Influence; Marketing strategy; Pharmaceutical marketing; Pharmaceutical products; Pharmacists,,scopus-recommendation

Management indecision,Brooks M.E.,2011,10.1108/00251741111130788,"Indecision is not the hallmark of a great manager, but what do we know about when and why managers avoid or postpone decisions? The purpose of this paper is to discuss the limited research on indecision. This article reviews research from judgment and decision making, psychology, management, and marketing literatures to assemble what we already know about indecision. The review spans situational and personal determinants of indecision, highlighting what we know about when and why people experience indecision as well as who is predictably indecisive. Decisions are avoided when people are asked to justify them, when options are similar in attractiveness, and when there are a large number of options to consider. Indecision may sometimes be a result of systematic biases (i.e. omission bias and status quo bias), and indecisive people may be more prone to confirmation bias. Finally, indecisiveness is related to numerous other individual differences, many of which are negative. Specific recommendations for managers include evaluating options separately rather than comparing options, structuring incentive systems to reward decisive action, and explicitly considering the risk of lost opportunity when deciding whether to put off making a decision. The literature reviewed in this paper spans diverse disciplines and perspectives. This paper provides a starting point for managers and researchers interested in understanding indecision: when and why it occurs, who is likely to be most indecisive, and what we might do to counter indecision. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Decision making; Leadership; Managers,,scopus-recommendation

Are they listening? Designing online recommendations for today's consumers,Lepkowska-White E.,2013,10.1108/JRIM-07-2012-0027,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the use of online recommendation systems on e-commerce sites is which becoming more common as marketers recognize their potential to improve their own operations as well as consumers' shopping experiences. Since some consumers question the credibility of these systems, this study compares responses to such systems (classified based on their source into seller and third party systems) with responses to recommendations coming directly from other consumers. The latter may also be better suited for consumers today since many of them utilize direct information from social media on a daily basis. Past research indicates that reactions to such recommendations may depend on the types of goods they describe and therefore this study also tests whether consumer responses vary with types of goods. The study examines consumer reactions to recommendations designed for search, experience, and credence goods. Finally, this study also explores the most desired features of recommendations to help marketers come up with the most effective recommendations that help facilitate purchasing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The study surveys a convenience sample of 202 undergraduate students to test these objectives. It was a 3 (product types) by 3 (recommendation types) factorial design with multiple dependent variables and three covariates. Findings: The study reveals that, irrespective of the product type, consumers react differently to the three types of recommendations that are tested. This study shows that consumers have the most positive attitudes and most frequently utilize recommendations coming directly from other consumer. This suggests that more attention should be directed to these recommendations in marketing theory and practice. Consumers also hold more positive attitudes towards third-party recommendation systems than recommendation systems coming from the seller. They also have more positive reactions toward recommendations designed for search and experience goods rather than credence products. Finally, the study also examines the usefulness of different characteristics of these recommendations to help online managers develop most effective recommendations online and finds that it varies with different types of recommendations and products for which recommendations are used. Originality/value: In addition to the recommendation systems that have been explored in the past (seller and third party systems), the study examines reactions to recommendations coming directly from other consumers, as these recommendations may be better suited for today's audiences. The study shows which recommendation type is best received and most frequently used online. It also tests reactions to recommendations designed for different types of goods. This study includes credence goods, in addition to search and experience products, since consumer reactions to recommendations designed for credence goods have not been yet explored in the past research. It also found that recommendations are better received for goods with a higher number of search features. Finally, the study explores the specific features of different recommendation types and based on the findings proposes how these online recommendations should be structured to be most effective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Advertising; Internet advertising; Internet marketing; Marketing communication; Online shopping; Young consumers,,scopus-recommendation
Do males and females differ in how they perceive and elaborate on agent-based recommendations in Internet-based selling?,Doong H.-S.; Wang H.-C.,2011,10.1016/j.elerap.2010.12.005,"Managers are eager to know whether they should use gender-specific strategies to communicate with male and female consumers differently to recommendation services in Internet-based selling, as both groups are worthwhile and profitable to target. This issue has been overlooked in the literature, despite its importance and the fact that recommendations have become a major online advertising tactic in recent years. This study is diverse from existing studies in three ways: testing recommendation agent acceptance in the information context, revealing gender effects and applying a new lens of cognition-conation. By proposing a theoretical model based on the advertising hierarchy of effects model, this study investigated consumers' elaboration processes towards recommendation agent advices. Based on 432 members randomly selected from a database of a well-known Internet-based sellers, the study finds that women consider perceived usefulness of recommendation agent advices to a greater extent than men while making decisions about the usefulness of recommendations. Further, consumers' perceived usefulness is more strongly influenced by their perceived shopping task uncertainty than by involvement, while more-involved consumers have lower levels of perceive shopping task uncertainty. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Divergence and convergence of commercial and scientific priorities in drug development: The case of Zelmid, the first SSRI antidepressant",Mulinari S.,2015,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.06.020,"Based on a realist conceptualization of interests, this paper explores how commercial and scientific priorities appear to have converged and diverged during the development of the antidepressant Zelmid. The drug represents the first of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to reach the market. Zelmid was synthesized in 1971 and launched by the Swedish firm Astra in 1982, but subsequently withdrawn the next year because of adverse neurological effects. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with scientists representing both industry and academia who had high-level involvement in various phases of the project (experimental, pre-clinical and clinical), as well as on textual sources such as scientific articles and memoirs. Zelmid was a product of mechanism-based or ""rational"" drug discovery from the early 1960s and the associated intermingling of science and commerce. It is argued that both scientists and the pharmaceutical company shared an interest in embracing mechanism-based drug discovery because it simultaneously promised medico-scientific advances and profits. However, the intermingling of science and commerce also strained the relationship between scientific and commercial priorities further along the trajectory of the drug; for example, concerning issues such as dosage strategy and drug use in primary care, where corporate management allegedly took decisions contrary to the recommendations of both academic and company scientists. On such occasions the asymmetry in power became apparent in scientists' narratives: commercial considerations trumped those of science since, ultimately, decisions rest with management, not with scientists. In addition, temporality appears to be associated with the divergence of commercial and scientific priorities. While rare during experimental and pre-clinical phases, divergence was concentrated downstream to the clinical testing and post-marketing phases. It is hypothesized that a similar pattern of convergence and divergence of commercial and scientific priorities may exist in the trajectory of other drugs. © 2015 The Author.",Antidepressant; Drug development; History; Interests; Pharmaceutical industry; Psychiatry; SSRI; Sweden,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
When generation Y buys European wine: A consumer decision-making model,Geringer S.D.; Patterson D.M.; Forsythe L.M.,2014,,"Tne purpose of this paper is to examine the nine-buying decision-making process of U.S. Generation Y purchasers, when they select European wines. This is one of few empirical studies of U.S. Generation Ywine consumers and their nine purchasing decisions. Using the Howard Model of Consumer Decision Making, the researchers analyzed the significant factors Generation Y purchasers use as they make decisions about wine purchases. Generation Y respondents across the United States who were of legal drinking age were surveyed. In total 713 usable surveys were obtained. Tne researchers found that when Generation Y purchasers consider European Mines, the variables of consumer experience and brand familiarity are significant to the decision process. In addition, the consumer search process helps to build brand familiarity. In turn, brand familiarity improves the consumer attitude which contributes to the intent to purchase wine. Tne results provide valuable information about Generation Y Mine purchasers and it is to these individuals the global wine industry is looking for market growth. European wineries and their associations can use this information to improve their promotional activities and better educate Generation Ypurchasers about their products as they develop marketing programs and positioning strategies Mithin the U.S. Wineries can also target other upon whom Generation Y purchasers rely for recommendations.

As a result of these characteristics, marketing management should be adapted to effectively handle the complicated environment in which customer decisions, and the firm's marketing decisions are made. Especially marketing must be effectively integrated with other managerial areas. In this context the paper focuses on the value of being market-oriented in high-tech markets. The need for integration marketing function with other management areas is formulated and explained. The conclusions are added to provide some recommendations for high-tech companies how to integrate marketing with other management areas.",,,scopus-recommendation
Identification of the decision maker for a patient's hospital choice: Who decides which hospital?,Sloane G.; Tidwell P.; Horsfield M.,1999,10.1300/J043v13n01_04,"If marketers wish to communicate the positive characteristics of purchasing the private hospital experience, the marketers need to be able to identify which of the participants in the purchasing process is acting in the role of decision maker. Research was undertaken of doctors in the rural setting. Potential respondents were selected from Orange to Broken Hill; from Coonabarabran to Young. Two private hospitals are known to be located within this region - one in Orange and one in Dubbo. In most cases, patients in the rural setting are having the final say as to which hospital to attend. They are filling the role of decision maker. The factors that potential patients are considering in their decision include the services provided by the hospital - specifically factors relating to accommodation, services and cost. These observations are those as interpreted by the doctors who see these patients. Based on the findings of the survey a number of recommendations have been made: (1) Any marketing communication by hospitals should target primarily patients and then doctors. (2) Further research should be undertaken to attempt to accurately determine what characteristics are considered when patients and doctors refer to hospital services. (3) Research should be undertaken to determine the identity of all parties involved in the purchasing decision process. (4) Further research should be undertaken of the general population to determine what factors relating to a hospital are considered when making the hospital purchasing decision.

An examination of buying centres in Irish biotechnology companies and its marketing implications,Howard P.; Doyle D.,2006,10.1108/08858620610681579,"Purpose This research is a qualitative study which aims to investigate the intricacies of organisational buying behaviour in the context of the Irish biotechnology industry. Particularly the research seeks to focus on the phenomenon of buying centres as the core decision-making unit in an organisation and examines the functionality of such a process. The main aims of the research study is to examine key influencers, as well as to examine the decision process itself so as to fully comprehend modern organisational buyer behaviour and to discuss these issues from a practical viewpoint beneficial to both the marketing and purchasing functions. Design/methodology/approach The research process was conducted through qualitative methods, which formed a combination of focus group and key respondent interviewing. A triangular approach of data was also used to obtain quality information and to achieve a platform upon which to base accurate conclusions. A small number of organisations from industry participated in this study, which was deemed sufficient as the purpose of the study was gaining insight as opposed to proving or disproving previous theories. Findings It was discovered that users were key influencers in the decision process as were quality control personnel. In addition the business functions were found to be the decision makers in a highly dynamic buying centre process, which is constantly changing in terms of numbers, participation, and structure. Based on the finding of the research newer models of organisation buying behaviour were developed in addition to appropriate marketing strategies being put forward in order to better represent the realities of modern business-to-business marketing. This is where the real benefits of this research will be seen as marketing organisations become more efficient, buying organisations develop best practice procedures, and academics can build on this research base to further enhance marketing knowledge.

"Online peer and editorial recommendations, trust, and choice in virtual markets",Smith D.; Menon S.; Sivakumar K.,2005,10.1002/dir.20041,"This research examines the influence of recommendations on consumer decision making during online shopping experiences. Evidence from two empirical studies suggests that many online consumers seek and accept recommendations in order to effectively manage the amount of information available during online search processes. These findings suggest that consumers use the mere availability of peer recommendations as a decision-making heuristic, irrespective of the peer recommender's personal characteristics. Findings also suggest that consumer preference for peer versus editorial recommendations depends on the specific nature of the consumer's shopping goal: utilitarian or hedonic Finally, results from this study indicate that consumers prefer peer and editorial recommendations over other types of effort-reducing cues that might be available during online search. As such, retailers must consider a number of factors including recommender characteristics, shopping goals, and product characteristics in their bid to provide consumers with the appropriate type of recommendation for their respective decision-making task. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.",,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-recommendation

Building on extant literature, the authors develop a model that delineates antecedents of and responses to the interpretation of a market situation. Using case-scenario methodology, the authors test the model in the context of a marketing decision (annual advertising and promotion budget recommendation) with data collected from a nationwide sample of hospital marketing executives. The results of the partial least squares analysis show that (1) cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use affect the extent to which managers perceive a given market situation as one in which they can control the outcomes of their decision; (2) the more managers perceive a situation as controllable, the more they appraise that situation as an opportunity; and (3) the more managers appraise a situation as an opportunity, the greater is the magnitude of their response.",,,scopus-recommendation
The Mannmaven: An agent for diffusing market information,Wiedmann K.-P.; Walsh G.; Mitchell V.-W.,2001,10.1080/13527260127413,"With the growing competition and complexity of marketing information,interpersonal communication is becoming increasingly important to marketers and consumers (mavens) who can act as disseminators of marketing communications and play an important role. Previous research, which has found that mavens are more likely to be female, has ignored the way in which these consumer communicators make decisions and process information. As male product markets grow and gender roles in shopping become blurred, identifying male mavens could be a useful promotional tool. Sixty male and 78 female market mavens were identified from a survey of 455 German consumers, which differed only marginally in terms of age and education. The prime decision-making traits of male mavens differed from females and were related to brand consciousness, shopping avoidance/satisficing, impulsiveness, speedy fashion seeking, perfectionism, price–value consciousness, confused by overchoice and quality brand loyal. Implications and recommendations for marketers targeting male product markets in Germany are discussed. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Gender Differences In Decision Making; Male Market Mavens; Word-OF-MOUTH Communication,,scopus-recommendation

Marketing-mix recommendations to manage value growth at P&G Asia-Pacific,Kumar V.; Fan J.; Gulati R.; Venkat P.,2009,10.1287/mksc.1080.0477,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) Asia-Pacific is interested in managing value growth. Only after fully understanding the true effects of the marketing-mix variables can P&G managers make strategic decisions answering questions such as the following: (1) Are the P&G brands in the detergent market inelastic or elastic with respect to price? How has the price elasticity changed over time? Can P&G increase the price of its brands to gain value growth? (2) What are the price, distribution, and sizing combinations needed to achieve the desirable value growth? (3) How can P&G gain market share from its competitors without cannibalizing its own brands? P&G Asia-Pacific approached us to develop a value growth framework to answer these questions. To generate the answers for the above questions, we develop a three-step weighted random coefficient estimator that captures the heterogeneity across cross sections (different stock-keeping units and states) and the endogeneity of distribution. Based on the parameter estimates, we provide strategic recommendations to P&G for a field test to validate our suggestions. We developed a simulator for P&G managers so that they can generate appropriate marketing-mix strategies for achieving the desired value growth. As a result, P&G gained over $39 million in value growth over a one-year period by implementing the recommendations from our modeling approach. © 2009 INFORMS.",Distribution; Marketing mix; Price elasticity; Random coefficient model; Revenue; Sales value; Sales volume; System of equations,,scopus-recommendation
Fuzzy quality attributes for evaluating Internet marketing system performance,Shih Y.-Y.; Hu J.-S.,2008,10.1080/14783360802351546,"Electronic commerce (EC) is an important issue both for research and in the real business world. In addition, the Internet is a new and rapidly growing marketing channel for companies developing B2B (Business to Business) or B2C (Business to Customers) electronic commerce. To obtain rewards from EC, dot-com companies should develop their marketing performance effectively to attract customers' attention toward purchasing goods and to provide satisfying service for customers on the Internet. But not all the dot-com companies are successful, many factors will affect the enterprise operation. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to establish a multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) framework for assessing and evaluating the marketing performance of Internet bookstore companies in Taiwan. Based on the hierarchical structure, a mixed MADM method with non-additive and additive fuzzy measurement is used to show the relative importance of quality attributes. Seven real cases are then used as illustrative the alternatives to demonstrate the synthesis decisions under the application of a mixed mode of both MADM methods.

Consumer use of the price-quality cue in financial services,Estelami H.,2008,10.1108/10610420810875115,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent of use of the price-quality cue in financial services, and to uncover some of its drivers. The drives studied are: advertising exposure, product complexity, and consumer price knowledge. The use of price as an indicator of quality has been a well-documented phenomenon in consumer goods markets. However, the existence of this relationship has not been tested in services, and in particular in financial services markets. Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey of over 200 individuals contacted through intercept interviews was conducted. The use of the price-quality cue and its drivers were measured using multi-item scales, for six financial services categories: checking accounts, financial advisory services, automobile insurance, home insurance, life insurance, and tax accounting. Findings - Significant variations in the use of price as an indicator of quality across financial services categories are identified. Furthermore, it is found that both consumer price knowledge and advertising exposure increase the use of the price-quality cue, while product complexity was found to have no significant impact on price-quality cue utilization for financial services. Research limitations/implications - Future research could expand the array of variables which drive consumers' use of the price-quality cue. In addition, a wider range of financial services categories could be studied. Practical implications - Knowing the extent by which consumers depend on the price-quality cue in their decisions is critical to optimal positioning of a financial brand. This paper provides specific managerial recommendations on how to approach the pricing and marketing of each of the six financial services categories studied. In addition public policymakers may find the findings of interest due to quality perception biases that may result from financial services providers' pricing tactics Originality/value - While previous research studies in price-quality cue utilization have primarily focused on manufactured goods, this paper is the only study that has examined the dynamics of price-quality cue utilization by consumers in financial services. This is an important inquiry due to the large volume of consumer expenditures in financial services categories, and the significant impact that these categories have on the financial stability and well-being of the public.",Customer relations; Customer service management; Financial services; Pricing; Quality,,scopus-recommendation
Travel motivations of package tour travelers,Chang J.C.,2007,,"Managers in the travel industry are keen to know what influences customer decision-making and how customers make their decisions. Travel motivation reflects one's needs and wants and can be viewed as a critical variable in relation to their purchase decisions. Travel motives for joining group travel may be different from those of free independent travelers. This study examined travel motives as well as travel decision-making of Taiwanese travellers with a group package tour abroad. The qualitative approach - participant observation first and telephone interviews with tour participants later - was conducted for data collection. It was found that socio-psychological needs were an important motivation for travel, and socio-economic considerations were regarded as a crucial motivation for travel decision-making. Furthermore, their decision-makings are also strongly influenced by their social relationships - friends/relatives' recommendations. The results also revealed that Taiwanese travelers' travel motivations are considerably related to the price paid. The 'push factor' appeared to have much more impact than the 'pull factor' for impelling Taiwanese travelers in the pursuit of a holiday. Since the source of information for taking a vacation plays an important role for decision-making, this research suggested that the travel agency should put more efforts on nurturing a positive corporate image in order to gain consumers' trust.

Recommendation Systems with Purchase Data,Bodapati A.V.,2008,10.1509/jmkr.45.1.77,"Many firms use decision tools called “automatic recommendation systems” that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions.

Findings: The study found that there was a high unmet demand for higher education overseas and that the visibility of Hong Kong's higher education was relatively weak in these Asian markets. In order to capture the continued rise of students in Asia, higher education institutions and the Hong Kong government need to work together to analyze the potential markets critically and employ marketing strategies sensibly. Several key recommendations have been provided based on the findings. Research limitations/implications: The study was undertaken in a few key cities in these three target markets. However, findings from the study may generate insights into other cities with similar characteristics in these countries and the Asian regions. Practical implications: The paper suggests that decision makers at the institutional level and government level seeking to enter these markets must pay attention to the importance of market segmentation and the 4P variables in formulating their marketing strategies. Originality/value: Few studies have examined the current condition of higher education services in these three emerging Asian markets. The study provides some useful marketing information to education decision makers in Hong Kong and elsewhere who may be interested in formulating marketing strategies in these markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Hong Kong, Higher education; International marketing; Market segmentation",,scopus-recommendation
Self-reliance of community enterprise: A case study of a Thap Lan Woman's Weaving Group in Prachin Buri Province,Poosiri P.,2007,,"The objective of this study was to study factors involving a self-reliance of agriculturist group. The selected group of the study was the Thap Lan woman's weaving group in Prachin Buri province. The study was carried out by collecting a primary data from interviewing group committees and group members. The secondary data were also collected from various documents. The study found that there are four internal factors: local wisdom, knowledge management, group management, marketing, and three external factors: community contexts, network, and government policies that has influence on self-reliance of the group. Besides, the group could be self-reliant by having five components: appropriate technology, circulated capital, sufficient raw materials in the locality, enthusiastic group leaders, and helpful group members. The recommendations from the study were five aspects to manage group. They were: 1) to conserve Lan palm trees for long run weaving usage; 2) to circulate functions within groups to attain new generation leadership; 3) to encourage members to participate in the group activities; 4) to perform continuous training for members to uplift their spirits and upgrade their work in order to set up their thoughts and speed up decision making by themselves; and 5) to develop a marketing management for the market enlargement. The suggestions for network were supporting productive information, managing, and accounting. The suggestions for further research were: 1) to study the factors which influence on the Thap Lan woman's weaving group; 2) to study and develop a Lan palm leaves drying machine for using in the rainy season.",Lan palm tree; Local wisdom; Self-reliance; Woman group,,scopus-recommendation
Demographic and psychographic variables associated with Hispanic business majors intending to pursue graduate studies: Marketing implications,Adams R.; Kalliny M.; Saran A.; de los Santos G.,2005,10.1140/epje/e2005-00012-3,"Increasing shifts in population proportions have led to an increasing demand on education institutions to recruit Hispanics. A random and stratified national sample was used to answer the following questions: (1) What are the psychographic typologies that are likely to identify Hispanic students by their desire to pursue or not to pursue graduate education? (2) What relationship, if any, does income of the parents play in a Hispanic student's decision to pursue graduate education? (3) Is there a direct relationship between the parents' level of education and Hispanic students' decision to pursue graduate work?

Narrowing the skills gap for marketers of the future,Dacko S.G.,2006,10.1108/02634500610665736,"Purpose - The purpose of the research is first, to understand, explain, and evaluate the nature and extent of marketing skill development in MBA programmes relative to the needs and desires of practitioners and students, and second, to present findings and recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of skill development in MBA programmes for the benefit of both marketing practitioners and academics. Design/methodology/approach - The research design/methodology is based primarily on survey research on skill development in MBA programmes from the perspectives of both graduates and marketing practitioners. Findings - This research suggests that six important skill weaknesses - decision making, leadership, problem formulation, persuasion, creativity, and negotiation - need to be developed among future marketers and that a marketing education framework should be based on the pillars of a project and dissertation, classroom debate and discussion, and oral presentations. Research limitations/implications - Future research should focus on understanding and explaining to an even greater extent how marketing education can make more effective use of interactive, hands-on learning approaches typified by a project and dissertation, classroom debates and discussions, and oral presentations. Practical implications - Implications for practice include the suggestion that practitioners must also assume responsibility for developing initiatives that facilitate marketing skill development as well. Originality/value - The new and original value and contribution of the research is that it extensively characterises and quantifies the extent of a marketing skill development gap - the gap between what marketing skills are being developed in MBA programmes and what practitioners want and need in marketers of the future in addition to providing recommendations to close the marketing skills gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Education; Marketing; Master of business administration; Skills; Skills shortages,,scopus-recommendation

Key motivations for bank patronage in Ghana,Hinson R.; Owusu-Frimpong N.; Dasah J.,2009,10.1108/02652320910979898,"Purpose: Banking in Ghana is now an intensely competitive proposition. In a competitive environment, it becomes imperative not just to attract customers, but also to design strategies aimed at maintaining these customers. Drawing on data from over 2,000 retail bank customers in Ghana, this study aims at understanding the key motivations for maintaining accounts with banks in respect of Ghanaian bank customers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from customers of 22 retail banks in Ghana. A two-stage sampling technique was adopted in obtaining the sample. First, for each of the banks, two branches were randomly selected from the list of all functionally operating branches. In the second stage, customers of the selected branches were randomly intercepted in the banking halls and the survey instrument administered to them. A total of 2,000 respondents were attracted. Logistic regression modelling was employed in analysing the data. Findings: Overall bank customers view proximity/accessibility as the most important factor in the opening and maintenance of accounts with banks in Ghana. Recommendations by friends appear to be the least important factor in Ghanaian bank consumers' decision to open and maintain a bank account in Ghana. The findings were strange to the extent that word-of-mouth marketing has been lauded as one of the most potent marketing communications tools in services marketing but the empirical findings from the study did not support this. Practical implications: To the extent that proximity is a key factor in the opening and maintenance of bank relationships in Ghana, distribution management must be given a more strategic imperative in bank management in Ghana. Bank branches must be sited in catchment areas with the highest propensity to attract and maintain an existing profitable bank clientele. Originality/value: The study is one of the few on bank marketing in Ghana that draws on a large bank consumer data set and utilizes robust statistical analysis to reach its conclusions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Banking; Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Ghana,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-recommendation
The ethical challenges of direct-to-consumer genetic testing,Berg C.; Fryer-Edwards K.,2008,10.1007/s10551-006-9298-8,"Genetic testing is currently subject to little oversight, despite the significant ethical issues involved. Repeated recommendations for increased regulation of the genetic testing market have led to little progress in the policy arena. A 2005 Internet search identified 13 websites offering health-related genetic testing for direct purchase by the consumer. Further examination of these sites showed that overall, biotech companies are not providing enough information for consumers to make well-informed decisions; they are not consistently offering genetic counseling services; and some sites even offer tests with little evidence of clinical value. This article aims to raise company and consumer awareness about the ethical concerns surrounding the direct-to-consumer marketing of health-related genetic tests. It also suggests ways that biotech companies can bring their services to the public in an ethically responsible manner, without increased regulatory oversight. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Direct-to-consumer marketing; Direct-to-consumer sales; DNA test; Genetic test; Internet; Marketing ethics,,scopus-recommendation
Functionality of riparian forest ecotones in the context of former Soviet Union and Swedish forest management histories,Lazdinis M.; Angelstam P.,2005,10.1016/S1389-9341(03)00069-8,"Forest management in Central and Eastern Europe, under direct or indirect Soviet influence, for a long time followed different management objectives and strategies as compared to the forest management in countries with market economies in Western Europe located in the same biogeographic zones. In the light of the appearing paradigms of natural disturbance regimes and ecosystem-based forest management we evaluate forest management in the former Soviet Union and Sweden with respect to conservation of riparian forest ecotones. We studied the site and forest age class distribution both along watercourses and at randomly selected locations in the surrounding terrain in managed landscapes in Sweden and the former Soviet Union, respectively. Along watercourses in the former Soviet Union 20% of the overall forest cover was classified as old-growth compared with 6% in the surrounding landscape. By contrast, although the proportion of site type distribution was similar, such forests were neither found along watercourses nor in the surrounding landscape in Sweden. The results hence show that the Soviet management policy resulted in better conditions from the biodiversity conservation perspective. We conclude that the forestry decision-making environment does matter for practical forest conservation. We also make the following recommendations to forest and environmental planners and decision-makers: (1) protect existing and restore and re-create riparian corridors in general; (2) maintain riparian forests along streams of all orders, because small rivers are as important for conservation of biodiversity as large rivers; (3) designate riparian corridors for protection not focusing on a single width, but rather based on vegetation site type appropriate for stand types with a continuous forest cover. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The development of a marketing strategy by Centurion Community Services; [Die ontwikkeling van 'n bemarkingstrategie vir centurion gemeenskapsdiens],Naudé M.C.; Terblanche L.S.,2004,,"Centurion Community Services (CCS), a social service agency situated in Lyttelton, Pretoria, was founded in February 1999. The geographical area where services were rendered over the past four years has been transformed from a once quiet rural scene to a densely populated urban area. The founding of CCS testifies to a pro-active step to address anticipated social problems associated with urbanisation. A qualitative study was launched with the aim to assess the community's perception concerning CCS and whether this service is able to fulfil the needs and wants of the community with a view of development of guidelines for a consumer-based marketing strategy. A schedule covering the seven critical areas of decision-making in a marketing strategy had been developed and utilised as a data collection instrument to collect data from respondents, who have all been beneficiaries in one way or another of this service. It was found that a strategic planning process should be implemented in order to obtain clarity regarding the vision and mission of the organization; a marketing plan (which includes the strategic analysis, the SWOT analysis, marketing objectives and marketing strategy) should be applied extensively.

Managing piracy: Pricing and sampling strategies for digital experience goods in vertically segmented markets,Chellappa R.K.; Shivendu S.,2005,10.1287/isre.1050.0069,"Digital goods lend themselves to versioning but also suffer from piracy losses. This paper develops a pricing model for digital experience goods in a segmented market and explores the optimality of sampling as a piracy-mitigating strategy. Consumers are aware of the true fit of an experience good to their tastes only after consumption, and as piracy offers an additional (albeit illegal) consumption opportunity, traditional segmentation findings from economics and sampling recommendations from marketing, need to be revisited. We develop a two-stage model of piracy for a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation for quality and their moral costs. In our model, some consumers pirate the product in the first stage allowing them to update their fit-perception that may result in re-evaluation of their buying/pirating decision in the second stage. We recommend distinct pricing and sampling strategies for underestimated and overestimated products and suggest that any potential benefits of piracy can be internalized through product sampling. Two counterintuitive results stand out. First, piracy losses are more severe for products that do not live up to their hype rather than for those that have been undervalued in the market, thus requiring a greater deterrence investment for the former, and second, unlike physical goods where sampling is always beneficial for underestimated products, sampling for digital goods is optimal only under narrowly denned circumstances due to the price boundaries created by both piracy and segmentation. © 2005 INFORMS.",Digital products; Experience goods; Piracy; Pricing; Sampling; Vertical segmentation,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-recommendation

Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire contained questions relating to 21 marketing strategies, associated with the elements of the marketing mix, plus a ""general marketing strategies"" category. It was completed by 172 Turkish companies, drawn from a national frame of 1,000. Data were analysed by factor analysis, with performance criteria set as the dependent variable. Results are reported for each of the elements of the marketing mix. Findings - Companies that modify their strategies appropriately can maintain or improve their performance in times of crisis. Conclusions and recommendations identify the strategic changes most likely to achieve that outcome, measured mainly in terms of sales, market share and profitability. Research limitations/implications - Subjective measures of performance were used because of practical obstacles to obtaining objective financial data from the sample, which would have severely reduced the response rate. Future studies should include such data in the analysis. They might also cross-index findings by company size, industry sector and market scope, and take account of company resources and skills.

Car security and the decision to recommend purchase,Shaw D.; Pease K.,2010,10.1057/cpcs.2010.3,"Drawing on data derived from Motoring Which assessments, the study investigates the role of vehicle security in the decision of people to recommend the purchase of a particular car model to a friend. This is important because, were security to be shown to be salient in purchaser decision making, it would be a factor in incentivising manufacturers and retailers to incorporate and stress car security in marketing. Crucially for purchasing decisions, security was observed to contribute to the willingness of people to recommend the purchase of a particular car model in 2007. This was not significantly so in 2008, although the association was in the same direction. The results are interpreted as modestly encouraging for the importance of security in purchaser decision making. Research on the role of vehicle crime in diminishing brand loyalty is advocated. Supplementary data analysis indicates that vehicles became more secure on average between 2007 and 2008, and that there was a triangular distribution between car price and car security, with expensive cars being uniformly secure, and cheaper cars exhibiting a range of security levels. © 2010 Macmillan.",Car security; Crime drop; Crime reduction incentives; Designing out crime; Purchase recommendation,,scopus-recommendation

"When do you want it? Time, decisions, and public policy",Lynch Jr. J.G.; Zauberman G.,2006,10.1509/jppm.25.1.67,"Most consumer decisions involve trade-offs of costs and benefits over time. The research literature on ""intertemporal choice"" examines behavioral regularities in how people think about such decisions, drawing from marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics. This diverse literature is relevant to the analysis of public policy issues related to consumers' discounting of future outcomes ""too much"" compared with sooner outcomes. A stream of outcomes can be viewed as occurring in three temporal regions: the present, the near future, and the more distant future. Somewhat different research streams have developed around the topic of underweighting outcomes in the distant (compared with the near) future and of overweighting outcomes in the present compared with any point in the future. The authors review key concepts from the literature on underweighting the distant future versus the near-term future to analyze policy issues related to consumers' saving for retirement and their response to rebates. The authors review key concepts from the literature on impulsive behavior and present-biased preferences to analyze the problems of self-control that people have in their consumption of ""sin"" products that are proximate and that affect rewards in the present.

Supply chain choice on the internet,Netessine S.; Rudi N.,2006,10.1287/mnsc.1060.0512,"Internet companies extensively use the practice of drop-shipping, where the wholesaler stocks and owns the inventory and ships products directly to customers at retailers' request. Under the drop-shipping arrangement, the supply chain benefits from risk pooling because the inventory for multiple retailers is stocked at the same location, the wholesaler's. Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in which retailers stock and own the inventory. These two supply chain structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability, the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and transportation costs. © 2006 INFORMS.",Competition; Drop-shipping; E-commerce; Equilibrium; Fulfillment; Supply chain,,scopus-recommendation

US consumers’ perceptions of garments inspired by Indonesian culture,Gupta S.; Miller N.J.,2010,10.1080/20932685.2010.10593060,"It is evident that there has been increase in integration of global economies as trade barriers were lifted in 2005 resulting in free trade. After agriculture, marketing of hand-produced, cultural products constitutes the second most important source of income in less developed countries of the world. The objectives of this study were to examine US consumers’ perceptions of garments that were culturally inspired by a specific sending culture to better understand the following: (1) perceptions of garment familiarity and garment complexity; (2) the relationship between perceived familiarity and garment adoption/acceptance; (3) the relationship between perceived familiarity and garment adoption/acceptance; (4) acceptance for garments culturally inspired by consumers’ cultural setting or geographic location; (5) acceptance for garments culturally inspired among the different age groups ; and (6) delineation of US consumers’ cultural creativity. To accomplish this endeavor an instrument, developed for measuring consumers’ responses to design characteristics, was tested on US female consumers from five areas of the country and in two age categories. The instrument developed integrated visual stimuli of garments with Likert-type scales and provided consumer data for conducting basic research. Garment attributes included three styles, two color ways, and two fabric print (3 x 2 x 2) =12 garments. The analyses were exploratory in that concepts and relationships were evaluated in a non-causal approach to provide a basis for further research. Generalizatibility was addressed through analysis of multiple consumer groups; however the fashion aspects of the stimuli prevent broad-spectrum application. This study focuses on garments that are culturally inspired by Indonesia as the sending culture. Indonesia is a country with strong textile dyeing and printing traditions. Indonesia is open to westernized silhouettes and it is also an important global source for textiles and clothing production. The Indonesian textile and clothing industry is vertically integrated, encompassing almost every stage of production and contributes significantly to the country’s economy. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation theory provides a foundation for examining issues that inhibit or encourage the adoption of ideas, products, or technologies as they are introduced to individuals or groups of people. Within Roger’s model is a five stage innovation-decision process. This research is concerned with the persuasion stage where the individual forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation. The persuasion stage provided a foundation for examining relationships between familiarity, complexity, and acceptance of Indonesian inspired garments. The two persuasion characteristics of interest were compatibility and complexity of Indonesian inspired products for US consumers. Compatibility reflects how well an innovation is perceived to match existing social norms, needs, and expectations. Complexity concerns how difficult the innovation is perceived as to understand. Diffusion of Innovation is a generic adoption model for innovative ideas and products and was therefore somewhat restrictive for applications to fashion product adoption. Sproles’ Fashion Adoption Theory was thus also employed to understand the concepts of familiarity, complexity and acceptance in the context of women’s apparel attitudes of garment color, fabric print, and style. Also examined in this research were the differences in US consumer responses based on geographic location, age, and cultural creativity. Social influences, socioeconomic characteristics and behavioral norms fluctuate across the North American continent. Subnations are said to exist that define eight differing regions of the US and hold distinguishable characteristics. This research examined the following five subnations and their general US region: Breadbasket (middle), Dixie (southeast), Foundry (northeast), Ecotopia (northwest), and MexAmerica (southwest). In addition to geographic location, two age groups of US female consumers were examined: 19 to 25 years of age and 35 to 55 years of age. Additionally, consumers’ level of cultural creativity was measured. In the US the categories of Moderns and Traditionals are more readily recognized consumer groups than the Cultural Creative group. Cultural Creative, are distinguished by values such as engaged action, altruism, self-actualization, spirituality and ecological sustainability. Variation in Cultural Creative qualities and levels were expected to contribute a greater understanding of product acceptance. Pearson correlation coefficients, univariate analysis of variance with least significance difference post hoc analysis, and forward multiple regressions were run to address the research objectives. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered to the manufacturers of Indonesian inspired garments. To successfully cross market their products to countries like US, manufacturers can retain the color ways culturally inspired by Indonesia as the participants found them to be familiar and highly acceptable.Recommendations for fabric print and styles would suggest lower levels of cultural inspiration for US consumer acceptance. Retailers and manufacturers would also be wise to market their products with strategies and priorities based on the climatic and demographic characteristics of the nine sub-nations, and to consider age categories particularly women between the ages of 35-55 years. It is clear the textile and apparel industry in Indonesia has a number of strengths that have enabled the country to expand its share of international markets. The US importation numbers largely reflect production of US designed apparel with an absence of Indonesian cultural traditions. The potential for designing and marketing Indonesian inspired garments will be enhanced through dissemination of research-based information regarding US female consumer preferences. © 2010 KAMS.

Examining the nature and dynamics of At-destination recommendations: The local experts' perspective,Wang Y.; Severt D.; Rompf P.,2006,10.1300/J150v13n03_08,"At-destination referrals from local experts play a critical and complementary role in information sourcing and venue decision strategies by visitors of a destination.

Upon the closing of a Florsheim shoe factory in a region of the Midwest that was once home to a large number of shoe and apparel manufacturers, with the majority of these having closed over the previous 30 years due to lower cost of overseas production, and concerned about the continuing loss of shoe manufacturing in the U.S., an entrepreneur from Chicago with minimal experience in the shoe industry, visited a Florsheim factory prior to its closing by Florsheim. After deciding that the facility represented too valuable a resource to be abandoned, the entrepreneur subsequently purchased the shoe plant and named his new venture the Cape Shoe Company. Based on his concern about losing American manufacturing jobs, and the belief that he could produce a competitively priced product, his plan was to produce 100 percent Made in America shoes.

Findings The results obtained show that the length, depth and breadth of relationships help to determine customers' propensity to switch fixed-telephone suppliers. Customers who maintain a long-lasting relationship with the firm length, use the service more depth, and invest in complementary services breadth will be less predisposed to switch. Practical implications With regard to recommendations for practitioners, the paper highlights the need for firms to renew both acquisition and retention strategies in order to take individual customer information into account. This should help them to identify and retain the most valuable customers and to optimally allocate marketing resources from switching-prone to non-switching-prone customers. Originality-value The main contribution of the paper is to consider relationship characteristics in the analysis of customer switching behavior. This research shows that the heterogeneity observed in the depth, length and breadth of customer-firm relationships explains the differences in the propensity to switch service providers. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Customer relations; Relationship marketing; Servicing; Suppliers,,scopus-recommendation
Consumer decision making in online shopping environments: The effects of interactive decision aids,Häubl G.; Trifts V.,2000,10.1287/mksc.19.1.4.15178,"Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aids for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives X attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making. In particular, we focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality and the efficiency of purchase decisions - shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort. This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.",Consideration sets; Consumer behavior; Decision aids; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information processing; Information search; Online shopping; Recommendation agents,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-recommendation
Communication about organ donation intentions: Formative research for a social marketing program targeting families,Jones S.C.; Reis S.L.; Andrews K.L.,2009,10.1080/15245000902894040,"With the introduction of the Australian Organ Donation Register, responsibility regarding organ donation decisions primarily rests with the individual. However, family members can be instrumental in facilitating or hindering the rate of organ donation by objecting to or confirming the individual's wishes. Attitudes and beliefs of family members have been shown to be a strong influence on people's intentions to donate. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that family communication about organ donation can improve the rate of organ donation. We surveyed 23 matched pairs of undergraduate university students and their parents and found that attitudes to organ donation were positive and that there was a tendency for these dyads to give concordant responses regarding attitudes, level of family communication, and intent to donate. These findings have implications for improving Australia's organ donation rate, and recommendations for messages promoting organ donation are discussed.",,,scopus-recommendation

These metrics may relate to traditional performance measures but have the potential to include new metrics or new ways of collecting existing metrics. This paper addresses the question of how web-based companies can use emetrics for strategic marketing decisions. Specifically, it identifies some aspects of the current use of emetrics in strategic marketing decisions within the web environment. In a preliminary investigation, interviews with web-based business units revealed that companies currently measure website performance and consumer behaviour online but are uncertain how best to use those metrics to inform strategic marketing decisions. The findings suggest that businesses are looking for recommendations regarding management and choice of emetrics that will increase comparability among companies as well as overcome current data limitations. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",emetrics; internet; marketing strategy; New Zealand; performance metrics; strategic decisions,,scopus-recommendation

The impact of choice factors on international students’ loyalty mediated by satisfaction,Amaro D.M.; Marques A.M.A.; Alves H.,2001,10.1007/s12208-019-00228-0,"The presence of international students is a valuable input for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) at all levels. Thus, it is critical to understand not only how students make their decisions and what factors and sources of information provided by the HEI most influence them, but also to evaluate students’ satisfaction and loyalty with the choice made, in order to define the most suitable and competitive marketing strategies to attract and retain international students. Based on the information gathered through a questionnaire with a sample of 190 international students studying at a Portuguese HEI, a quantitative, cross-sectional and causal study was conducted using the estimation of a structural equation model calculated through PLS, in order to investigate the impact of choice factors and information sources on international students’ loyalty, mediated by satisfaction with the choice made. The findings indicate that the choice factors with the greatest impact on satisfaction of the international students were: the perception of the country, the environment and location of the HEI, and the sources of information provided by the HEI. It was also concluded that a positive global perception of the HEI influences the recommendation from significant others, and increases the satisfaction and loyalty of all the international students. Thus, HEI managers should account for these factors when making strategic marketing decisions to increase the number of international students. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Choice factors and information sources; International students; Loyalty; PLS; Satisfaction,Springer,scopus-recommendation
Catering to the healthy-living vacationer,Hallab Z.,2006,10.1177/1356766706059043,"An essential function that is recommended for destinations and tourism and hospitality organizations to undertake is to learn about developments in the external environment that may have a substantial impact on the competitiveness of their business. The healthy-living lifestyle has been gaining momentum in the USA and in various parts of the world; more than ever, programs, products, and regulations are being developed and implemented to cater to members of the mentioned lifestyle and to support the overall well being of societies.

The nature of gratuitous referrals in tourism: Local residents' perspective,Walls A.; Shani A.; Rompf P.D.,2008,10.1108/09596110810892218,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the referral patterns of local residents who are frequently requested by visitors to the community to provide information and/or direct venue referrals for travel-related services. Also investigated, were the factors influencing the selection of a specific venue being referred. It is posited that visitors delay many travel decisions until they arrive at a destination and extensively utilize local ""experts"" in their decision strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The current study expands upon previous research on visitor decision strategies for travel-related services once that are at a destination by examining the referral activity of 180 residents in the metro-Orlando area, a destination that attracts more than 47 millions visitors each year. A standardized questionnaire was utilized to collect data in two distinct areas of the destination, a central tourism corridor and a bedroom community. Findings - In general, at-destination recommendations from locals were found to be highly sought by visitors, regardless of the occupation of the perceived local expert. In addition, although the weekly frequency of requests to a local expert was typically lower in the bedroom community in contrast to the tourism corridor, they still existed in significant enough numbers such that they should capture the attention of enterprises providing such services. At the least, a partial alignment of an enterprise's promotional strategies and tactics to reach targeted visitor segments through ""locals"" becomes obvious. Overall, notable recommendation patterns were not uniform across type of service enterprise, and were highly evident for food and beverage and entertainment facilities, while recommendations for lodging facilities were found to be limited in this study. It was also determined that local residents were most influenced by organic factors compared to induced factors. Research limitations/implications - The results suggest that hospitality businesses should focus a portion of their marketing strategies and tactics towards the community in order to attain/drive positive word-of-mouth referrals. This implication is particularly relevant for restaurants and shopping venues. Finally, it is suggested that the most effective way for businesses to reach local residents is through direct contact and communication, rather than traditional advertising channels. Originality/value - The paper has both theoretical and practical value, and provides further confirmation that tourists delay/make many decisions post-arrival and that locals play an important role in travel-decision process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communities; Decision making; Information exchange; Tourism; Travel; United States of America,,scopus-recommendation

To illustrate, four samples of festivals from the UK, Australia, Norway and Sweden are systematically compared in terms of their ownership, governance, structure, and content. Although the festivals offered a similar product and had similar mandates, they differed considerably in terms of revenue sources, cost structure, use of volunteers, corporate sponsorship, and decision-making. These differences are potentially important to destinations that view festivals as attractions and use them in place marketing. Implications are drawn for festival management and tourism policy, and recommendations are made for extending this line of inquiry to the tourism industry as a whole. © 2008.",Business models; Festivals; Mixed industry; Ownership,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation
How packaging affects the product preferences of children and the buyer behaviour of their parents in the food industry,Ogba I.E.; Johnson R.,2010,10.1108/17473611011026037,"Purpose – Health is becoming an increasingly important issue in the UK as well as the rest of Europe. Emphasis on the importance of healthy eating is ongoing for many reasons, including the growing concern about childhood obesity resulting in the ban of advertising of unhealthy foods to children in the UK in April 2007. However, although legislation has been placed upon the advertising of unhealthy food products, no such restrictions have been placed on the packaging of children's foods despite the influence of packaging on consumer buyer decisions. This paper aims to investigate the effect of packaging on children's product preferences and its ability to influence parents' buyer decision in-store. Design/methodology/approach – The study was approached from the parents' rather than the children's perspective. A quantitative approach was adopted in data collection, using a 28 item Likert scaled questionnaire administered to 150 parents, with over 95 percent response rate. Findings – The study shows that packaging does affect the product preferences of children. Also, children are particularly interested in influencing the purchase of unhealthy foods. However, parents within the study claimed that they did not succumb to their children's requests for the purchase of unhealthy food, which contradicts evidence from previous findings. Research limitations/implications – The claim by parents that they did not succumb to their children's requests for unhealthy food contradicts findings from previous research. This therefore leads to a recommendation for further studies as social desirability bias may have influenced the outcomes of the findings. Practical implications – Findings from this study can be applied within the retail and service marketing sector to provide the practitioner with information relevant to decision making on children's influence on parents buyer behavior in-store. Outcomes of the study are also important when considering the future of children's food marketing and tackling the issue of childhood obesity. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates that there is a relationship between packaging and children product preferences and children's influence on parents' buyer decision in-store. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Children (age groups); Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Food packaging; Parents; United Kingdom,,scopus-recommendation
Reactance to Recommendations: When Unsolicited Advice Yields Contrary Responses,Fitzsimons G.J.; Lehmann D.R.,2004,10.1287/mksc.1030.0033,"Recommendations often play a positive role in the decision process by reducing the difficulty associated with choosing between options. However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive and more undesirable role from the perspectives of both the recommending agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.",Decision support systems; Intelligent agents; Internet marketing; Recommendations,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-recommendation

Secondary issues include price discrimination by small firms in foreign markets; product differentiation in international markets; branding and price discrimination. This case has a difficulty level of 3-4 and is targeted at business students in a first course in international business or international marketing. The case can be used either as a functional case on pricing in the international environment, or as a study in exporting. One hour of class time should be sufficient to handle the case discussion and students should budget 2-3 hours of time for case preparation. Case Synopsis: The PURAC Enviro-Filter Company is a small manufacturer of air filters located in southern Florida, USA. Diana Page, the firm's marketing manager is in the process of determining her target price for the upcoming year for their most profitable product, the F-18 filter. Just as she was finalizing her recommendation, one of her salespeople approached her with the possibility of entering into a contract for a distributor branded sale to Russia. This would be a new market for her company. The price offered by the Russian mass merchandiser is much lower than that charged for branded PURAC filters in the domestic market. This new market opportunity complicates Diana's decision process. She must decide at what price to offer her goods for sale at home, and consider the relative advantages of the new offer presented by the foreign market proposal. She must decide the probably effect of these additional sales on the firm's profitability and what conditions to negotiate with the Russian company if PURAC decides to accept their offer. © 2009 by the DreamCatchers Group.",,,scopus-recommendation

Does advertising spending influence media coverage of the advertiser?,Rinallo D.; Basuroy S.,2009,10.1509/jmkg.73.6.33,"Recent studies have shown that consumers' product choices are significantly influenced by media coverage and recommendations in various media outlets. Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002-2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States.

"Defense Conversion in Small Companies: Risk, Activities, and Success Assessment",Hougui S.Z.; Shenhar A.J.; Dvir D.; Tishler A.,2002,10.1023/A:1015648404569,"The defense industry has been experiencing a large draw-down during the 1990s. This has left many companies, large and small, in a situation where they had to examine the viability and future of their businesses. While large and medium-size companies were somewhat assisted by government policies and support, small subcontractors were often left alone, facing higher risks and severe threats to their future. This research investigated the events, decisions, activities and success of small defense contractors, which had to face this new situation. It developed a specific framework, which may be used to help companies in assessing their conversion efforts. The study was conducted by utilizing a within-case and cross-case methodology for case study analysis. Results assert the difficulties for highly defense dependent companies to enter and succeed in the commercial market and explain why many conversion efforts have often failed in the past. Our findings show that to convert successfully, companies must streamline and improve their internal processes, develop a strategic plan, develop their marketing capabilities, and must have management and employee commitment to the process. Although such recommendations were expected, we found, that to many of these companies, they were completely new.

Tackling ethical dilemmas in project management using vignettes,Loo R.,2002,10.1016/S0263-7863(01)00056-4,"While many measures address, say, marketing ethics, relatively less attention has been paid to ethical dilemmas and decision-making specifically in project management. This paper presents results from the development of a multidimensional measure of ethical dilemmas and decision-making in project management. The investigator developed three vignettes representing ethical dilemmas that could be realistically found in three phases of most projects (the planning, execution, and termination phases). Each vignette is followed by Reidenbach and Robin's (Reidenbach RE, Robin DP. Toward the development of a multidimensional scale for improving evaluations in business ethics. Journal of Business Ethics 1990;9:639-653) 30-item response scale tapping five theories of ethics: Justice, Relativism, Egoism, Utilitarianism, and Deontology. Results from 247 management undergraduates doing project management validate the three vignettes and support this approach in stimulating heated class discussion on ethics. Recommendations are presented for trainers and project managers. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and IPMA.

Marketing's influence tactics in new product development: A study of high technology firms in China,Atuahene-Gima K.; Li H.,2000,10.1016/S0737-6782(00)00059-X,"It has been widely recognized that marketing's interaction with other functional departments (e.g., R&D) has significant impact on new product success. However, little research addresses how marketing actually behaves in the process of new product development (NPD). Drawing upon marketing, product innovation, and organizational buying literatures, this study contributes to the literature by delineating the types of influence tactics adopted by marketing and investigating how the use of these tactics affects marketing's influence on NPD decisions. Data on 128 new product projects from 114 high technology firms in China were collected from R&D perspective via on-site interviews. The findings indicate that, from the R&D's perspective, both marketing and R&D seem to have equivalent influence on new product decisions. In terms of usage frequency, the most frequently used influence tactics by marketing are persistent pressure, information exchange, and recommendation (i.e., use of rational logic). Coalition formation (e.g., seeking the support of peers) and upward appeal (i.e., seeking support from superiors) tactics are moderately used. The less frequently used tactics are legalistic plea (i.e., use of rules and regulations) and request. Regarding the effectiveness of influence tactics, the results indicate that persistent pressure, information exchange, and coalition formation lead to higher marketing influence in NPD decisions. However, the use of an upward appeal tactic leads to lower marketing influence. Recommendation, legalistic plea and request tactics are unrelated to marketing's influence. Our results also show that the efficacy of marketing's influence tactics is contingent upon the degree of functional interdependence in the NPD stages and the degree of interdepartmental conflict. Information exchange and coalition formation tactics are more effective at the initiation stage of the NPD process whereas legalistic plea and persistent pressure are more effective at the implementation stage. We further find that legalistic plea is more effective but coalition tactic is less effective when the degree of interdepartmental conflict is higher. Findings of this study provide managers responsible for ensuring market-oriented NPD with a better understanding of how the influence of marketing in the NPD process may be enhanced. Given our focus on Chinese firms, they also suggest that managers need to be sensitive to the cultural context of marketing influence.",,,scopus-recommendation
Regaining a seat at the table: Marketing management and the e-service opportunity,Hughes T.,2007,10.1108/08876040710758577,"Purpose - The study outlined in this paper seeks to deepen one's understanding of the theoretical and practical implications for marketing management where an internet component has been added to the business. Design/methodology/approach - Cases were developed primarily from individual in-depth interviews with 30 managers from financial services. Findings - In setting up an e-commerce capability the case study organizations have been taking strategic decisions on customer interaction. Aligning channels cost-effectively with appropriate customers requires difficult decisions to be made in targeting and managing different customer segments. At the operational level many aspects of customer interaction can be handled centrally, moving the emphasis of customer management into customer service departments. Research limitations/implications - The question of how best to manage customers effectively, using e-service in an integrated manner with other channels, can be seen to be complex and requires further research in order to extend theory in this area and give more meaningful guidance to marketing practitioners. Practical implications - The marketing function has the potential to play a prime role in ensuring that remote customer management is effective. Recommendations are made for practising managers on developing an integrated channel strategy; setting up processes for managing customer feedback from the new channels and responding to this feedback. Originality/value - E-service is throwing up new and fundamental challenges for organizations and this potentially provides new opportunities for marketing practitioners to play a leading role at strategic and operational levels.

Decision-making associated with drug candidates in the biotechnology research and development (R&D) pipeline,Skrepnek G.H.; Sarnowski J.J.,2007,10.1057/palgrave.jcb.3050040,"This research investigated the issues and methods of analysis considered by executives when managing biotechnology drug candidates within the research and development (R&D) pipeline. A mail survey was developed to assess: (1) factors considered during clinical trials; (2) sources of funding for R&D; (3) analytic tools used in decision-making; and (4) the use and application of pharmacoeconomics, and targeted primarily Chief Financial Officers (CFO) within 396 biotechnology firms in the United States (US). Consistent with prior research on CFOs, a response rate of 7.5 per cent was achieved and respondents generally represented smaller biotechnology companies valued below US$100m. Findings indicated that regulatory and capital requirements as well as investor expectations were important factors throughout clinical phase trials. Venture capital and capital/securities markets were the most commonly used sources of R&D capital. The most frequently cited decision-making techniques used included prior experience/intuition/ human judgment, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Pharmacoeconomic methods were utilised at every stage of R&D and applied to the management of R&D pipelines in addition to aspects of product pricing and reimbursement. Overall, these results reflect the nature of risk and uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D. Although the use of past experience/intuition/human judgment was most common for decision-making, methods based upon discounted cash flow (DCF) approaches were also employed frequently, as was the use of pharmacoeconomics. The implications of this work should seek to catalyse the development and utilisation of robust methods to manage drug pipelines such that senior executives are afforded optimal recommendations when attempting to hedge risk and maximise return.",,,scopus-recommendation
Determinants of escrow service adoption in consumer-to-consumer online auction market: An experimental study,Antony S.; Lin Z.; Xu B.,2006,10.1016/j.dss.2006.04.012,"Risk relief services (RRSs), as complementary to online trust promoting services, are becoming versatile options for risk reduction in online consumer-to-consumer auctions. In this paper, we identify factors that affect the behavior of buyers in an online auction market who had to either adopt or not adopt online escrow services (OES). An experimental C2C auction system with embedded decision support features was used to collect data. Results show that market factors, such as fraud rate, product price, and seller's reputation are important in determining buyers' OES adoption. This study also finds that sellers' reputation has a significant effect on buyer's risk perception, which influences his OES adoption decision. Furthermore, the buyers' OES adoption decisions were found to be congruent with the implied recommendations that were based on expected utility calculations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Limitations of European Union policy and law for regulating use of lead shot and sinkers: Comparisons with North American regulation,Thomas V.G.; Guitart R.,2010,10.1002/eet.527,"Extensive shooting and angling causes, indirectly, fatal lead poisoning of birds. European Union policy on this major source of pollution is inconsistent with its laws regulating other forms of lead in the environment. Only three countries have banned the use of lead shot completely in the European Union, despite availability of substitutes and evidence that their use is a major contributor to bird conservation. The European Commission uses the criterion of amount of lead deposited and corroded, and the concentration of lead in water and soil, as the basis of their decisions. The USA and Canada used the prevalence of lead poisoning among birds as the basis of policy and law allowing them to reduce lead use at the continental level. The EU and North American policies and law on lead reduction are compared in this study, on the basis of which recommendations are developed indicating how the EU could revise its approach and resolve this environmental problem. Reluctance to act on lead reduction by the European Parliament and its member states refl ects the current vested interests of the sporting communities. Companies in eight European countries already produce non-toxic materials for hunting and shooting, and are not the limiting factor in this issue.

Different stakeholders - ie locals, tourists, tourist entreprenuers, politicians, farmers, hunters, etc - regard Alpine landscapes with different eyes, yet there are also connecting elements: these are referred to in tourism marketing and in political dialogue. The present article develops a conceptual model landscape perception consisting of 4 poles - 'nature' and 'culture' as well as 'individual' and 'society' - that contributes to a better understanding of the meanings that landscapes have for different people. The model helps to find existing commonalities among stakeholders and overcome obstacles.

This article focuses on consent rates of families who make a donation decision for a deceased loved one, and how social marketing efforts to increase organ donation can be enhanced by better understanding the decision-making process these families use. Three categories of factors bear significantly on that decision which, if not addressed properly, will very likely result in a refusal to donate. These deal breaker categories include (1) family predisposition and family care, (2) requestor characteristics, and (3) request dynamics.

External and internal accountability of financial services suppliers: Current paradoxes in managing expectations and experience,O'loughlin D.; Szmigin I.,2005,10.1080/09652540500083008,"Reflecting recent European and International trends, the Irish financial services sector has witnessed phenomenal technological and competitive developments, affecting consumer decision–making and behaviour and forcing financial suppliers to re–assess their approach to setting customer expectations and assessing the consumer experience. This study, using a purposive sample of financial services managers and experts, shows suppliers increasingly struggling to practice external accountability to their customers and internal accountability to their employees. In terms of external accountability, suppliers identified numerous brand–related issues and challenges, including the increasing lack of brand differentiation and the difficulties in creating meaningful brand images, which are posing significant difficulties in creating positive and appealing customer expectations. In relation to internal accountability, suppliers highlighted the challenges associated with empowering their employees to provide a personal and superior service and meeting the evolving requirements of an increasingly diverse customer base. Recommendations are made in relation to the incorporation of consumer research, internal marketing and technology in order to provide a banking experience which facilitates supplier commitment and accountability to both customers and employees. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Expectations vs. experience; Financial supplier accountability; Irish banking sector,,scopus-recommendation
Blockbuster culture's next rise or fall: The impact of recommender systems on sales diversity,Fleder D.; Hosanagar K.,2009,10.1287/mnsc.1080.0974,"This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumerproduct matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individuallevel diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences. © 2009 INFORMS.",Advertising and media; Application contexts/sectors; Electronic commerce; It impacts on industry and market structure; It policy and management; Marketing,,scopus-recommendation
A logit analysis of electronic banking in New Zealand,Gan C.; Clemes M.; Limsombunchai V.; Weng A.,2006,10.1108/02652320610701717,"Purpose – In this paper the competitive landscape of financial institutions is shifting and internet banking is no longer a competitive advantage but a competitive necessity for banks. However, a limited number of empirical studies have been published in the marketing literature about electronic banking. This paper seeks to examine consumers' choices between electronic banking and non-electronic banking in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows that the data for this analysis were obtained through a mail survey sent to 1,960 households in New Zealand. The decision to use electronic banking is hypothesised to be a function of service quality dimensions, perceived risk factors, user input factors, price factors, service product characteristics, individual factors and demographic variables such as age, gender, marital status, income, etc. Logistic regression is used to analyse the data. The discrete dependent variable measures whether an individual is an electronic banking or non-electronic banking user. Findings – The findings in the paper show that the output from the logistic regression indicates that the service quality, perceived risk factors, user input factors, employment, and education are the dominant variables that influence consumers' choice of electronic banking and non-electronic banking channels. Practical implications – This paper provides an improved understanding of consumers' choice between electronic and non-electronic banking. This paper also identifies new relationships, and provides findings that further support, confirm, or contradict previous studies. In addition, it provides insights into the links between electronic banking and consumer decision making, to help provide strategies, recommendations and guidelines for the banking industry.

A critical comparative study of visitor motivations for attending music festivals: A case study of glastonbury and v festival,Gelder G.; Robinson P.,2009,10.3727/152599509790029792,"A global industry of festivals and events has evolved and developed rapidly since the early 1900s. This phenomenal growth, coupled with increased consumer awareness and choice, requires sustained development and growth in the future. Music festivals are unique events that attract audiences for a variety of reasons; however, while music-based events are an extremely popular form of entertainment, research exploring the motivations of music festival audiences is sparse, especially from a UK perspective. Crompton and McKay contend that event managers should strive to better understand the motives of festival attendance in order to design better products and services for them and because motives are a precursor of satisfaction and a factor in decision making, this in turn can lead to greater attendance. This study critically compares the visitor motivations for attending two UK-based music festivals to challenge and ultimately support existing ideas developed from similar research overseas. The article establishes some of the first research into this area within the UK and challenges common assumptions from those in industry. A range of secondary research was considered and a review of existing literature on the subject was undertaken. Although the sample size was relatively small, the results showed that socializing with friends and family was a primary motive. Most importantly, the article supported the notion that multiple motivations come into play and it suggests that it is risky for festival managers to rely solely on the theme of the event itself. It is equally important to create a fun and festive atmosphere that offers ample opportunity to socialize and have new and nonmusical experiences. Several recommendations were made for existing and future managers including focusing on realigning marketing and service strategies. Recommendations were also made for future research in terms of adopting new methodological approaches including the use of multiple means of analysis. The article finally challenges the nature of the underpinning theory and questions the reason that so much of what is understood is still based in the field of sociology in tourism, with very little underpinning theory dedicated to the events industry, despite its emergence as an academic field over a decade ago. © 2009 Cognizant Comm.

Polish Government policy for coal (1989-2006),Zientara P.,2007,10.1108/17506220710821143,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss and assess the consecutive Governments' policy for coal (1989-2006) in the context of the systemic transformation of the Polish economy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a critical analysis of the rationale and effectiveness of government efforts to restructure the Polish coal mining industry in the light of economic theory, published literature, and a survey of three collieries. Some parallels, toutes proportions gardées, are drawn between the situation in the UK under Margaret Thatcher and that in Poland. Findings: The paper arguesthat, despite throwing billions of zlotys at the industry in the form of direct subsidies and debt write-offs, decision makers failed to make the collieries economically sound. The weaknesses of the consecutive governments - manifesting itself, amongst other things, in the unwillingness and/or inability to confront the miners' unions, to introduce market mechanisms into the sector, to ensure competent management and, crucially, to press on with nationwide economic liberalisation - are seen as the principal reasons behind the failure. Practical implications: The paper highlights the root causes of government ineffectiveness as well as aspires to provide policy recommendations with a view to rendering the Polish coal industry economically viable in a free-market reality.

The purpose of this research was to investigate and determine the extent, if any, that perspectives of IS planning and management advocated in the US literature could be found in practice in Chinese business organizations. Semi-structured interviews with general managers and IS directors in five Chinese business organizations were conducted to address this problem in the four areas of IS planning support, IS planning methodologies, data resource management, and the IS manager's role. The results reveal that Chinese 4business organizations do not automate administrative and business record keeping activities as their first step. Instead, they place highest priority on implementing systems that provide information to support management control decision making in meeting planned business performance objectives, such as achieving sales quotas or filling customer contracts on time. The results of this study show that the five Chinese businesses aligned their IS applications with a specific few business functions that were critical to successful achievement of their goals.

Uniquely defined report cards can be useful to organizations and their stakeholders. Health care executives competing for marketshare in an era of negotiated prices and payor-controlled access to healthcare services must provide information about clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and organizational performance to those who are responsible for selecting health providers or health plans. The organization's leaders must view the reporting process as important from a strategic perspective, and establish processes and allocate resources to produce a report in an efficient and cost-effective manner that will meet the information needs of key stakeholders. Developing useful outcomes report cards will require collaboration among many individuals in an organization, and perhaps collaboration among organizations in a market area. Expected benefits to the organization include improvement in stakeholder relationships, which might be measured through increased market share. The proposed implementation model is based on a synthesis of processes and recommendations reported in the literature extended by information from an in-depth case study. Problematic issues with outcomes data and public reporting have been considered. Although the model is derived from a conceptual and research base, it is both pragmatic in design, and solution- centered. Research questions for future empirical research might include the following: Which stakeholders are appropriate recipients of what types of information? How do different stakeholders evaluate the relative importance of each type of information? Which reporting formats are more appropriate for which stakeholders?

Toward a model of new product preannouncement timing,Lilly Bryan; Walters Rockney,1997,10.1016/S0737-6782(96)00092-6,"For products and services ranging from software to the latest motion picture, the use of new product preannouncements (NPPAs) has become commonplace. However, despite the key role that NPPAs play in the successful release of new products, almost no research has been conducted to explore the proper timing for such communications. This work provides a starting point for these investigations, by describing the elements of an NPPA and presenting a model of the factors that influence NPPA timing. Drawing on existing research and interviews with managers from firms in a wide range of industries, insights are offered into the nature and timing of NPPAs. Furthermore, recommendations are given for improving the effectiveness of NPPAs.",,Elsevier Science Inc,scopus-recommendation
The need for hybrid decision systems in complex marketing domains: HYMS,Burrell P.; Duan Y.; Boskovic A.,1995,10.1080/12460125.1995.10511662,"The complexity of strategic market planning is well known to those working in this area. It requires many expert and intuitive judgements based on a number of interrelated, yet diverse, market factors. It would seem that expert systems and decision support systems might have a large impact in this area but the development of such systems has proven difficult with results, so far, less than originally conceived. This paper describes a hybrid expert system HYMS for strategic marketing planning. HYMS aims to provide a structured marketing planning process, guide a user through this process, offer expert advice at key stages and finally make recommendations for users in setting objectives and strategies. It combines the advantages of the expert system and decision support system technology in order to enhance its effectiveness. The paper first presents a brief review on expert systems and decision support systems in marketing. It also discusses the selection of a strategic marketing planning model for HYMS and a method by which structure and objectivity are introduced into the, largely subjective, process of assigning importance to various marketing factors. Finally, it describes the architecture of the prototype system and concludes with remarks from expert users in this field. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Analytic hierarchy process; Decision support; Expert system; Marketing; Strategic management,,scopus-recommendation

Although previous research by the authors has confirmed various hypotheses on the influence of relevant variables on channel intermediaries' decisions to accept a new product, it could not capture the range of options of a new product's decision environment. This article augments past research by analyzing buyers' accept/reject recommendations for a large number of hypothetical new products. Logistic regression analyses of these data confirmed certain past results: product decisions are found to vary as a function of buyer/product category, gross margin, and product uniqueness. New findings, however, suggest that overall vendor marketing strategy encompasses the most important set of individual attributes influencing buyers' decisions. Manufacturers would increase the probability of having new products accepted by selecting the optimal levels of the various marketing strategy variables. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Marketing to public- and private-sector companies in emerging countries: A study of Indian purchasing managers,Karande K.; Shankarmahesh M.N.; Rao C.P.,1999,10.1177/1069031x9900700306,"Existing literature provides little guidance to international managers for selling to public-and private-sector companies in emerging countries. This research attempts to fill this gap using the context of India. The study focuses on the criteria used by industrial buyers to evaluate suppliers. Four hypotheses related to the differences in the importance placed on economic criteria, familiarity with the supplier, reliability of the supplier, and other capabilities of the supplier by purchasing managers from public-and private-sector companies in India are proposed and tested. Purchasing managers from private-sector organizations place more importance on economic criteria and other capabilities of the supplier than do purchasing managers from public-sector organizations. However, there is no difference in the importance placed on the reliability of the supplier by public-and private-sector purchasing managers. Also, no differences in the perception of familiarity as a supplier evaluation dimension are found.

Slotting allowances and the retail sale of alcohol beverages,Gundlach G.T.; Bloom P.N.,1998,10.1177/074391569801700203,"Considerable controversy and debate surrounds the practice of slotting allowances, or fees, paid by manufacturers for obtaining the patronage of retailers. To date, regulators have yet to agree on public policy toward these practices; at least one federal antitrust agency suggests that slotting fees may be competitive, another has conducted investigations into these practices, and still another suggests banning them altogether. In this article, the authors examine the recent decision by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) to prohibit slotting allowances in the retail sale of alcohol beverages. Focusing on the regulatory environment, industry structure, marketing practices, and consumer consumption behavior in the alcohol beverage industry, the authors analyze the BATF's decision and attempt to reconcile disparate public policy treatment of these practices.

Attracting foreign investment? The role of investment incentives in the ASEAN operations of transnational corporations,Yeung H.W.,1996,10.1080/09512749608719201,"Policymakers in many developing Asian countries have commonly relied on investment incentives as a major policy instrument to attract foreign investment. Using comparative case studies of Asian transnational corporations (TNCs) in Southeast Asia, this paper argues that investment incentives per se are ineffective in attracting foreign investment. The paper first examines the role of government incentives in the inflow of foreign investment, with particular reference to the Southeast Asian region. It then provides a comparative study of Hong Kong and Taiwanese investments. Hong Kong TNCs are shown to have invested in Southeast Asia because of market or market‐related reasons, not investment incentives per se. To these firms from Hong Kong, investment incentives are more a kind of post hoc rationalization of their decision making. For the Taiwanese investors in Malaysia, government incentives are less important than the existence of market access and the friendly host country environment. The paper also suggests some implications and specific policy recommendations for policymakers in host country governments. Instead of over‐reliance on investment incentives, host country governments should be more concerned with: 1) a commitment to internationalization through the promotion and marketing of international images; 2) the upgrading of domestic resources through continuous training and development; 3) a more efficient allocation of resources; 4) supra‐national coordination and promotion. © Routledge 1996.",,,scopus-recommendation

Using focus group methodology for ergonomic design,Caplan S.,1990,10.1080/00140139008927160,"Focus groups are a common tool used in marketing research to determine customers' attitudes about products or services. With careful attention to the basic structure and using selected quantitative enhancements, focus groups can also be used by ergonomists for developing solutions to product and workplace problems. By involving users and supplementing their verbal reactions with 'hard data', focus group results can be understandable to marketeers, engineers, and management. Thus, the methodology gives practitioners an effective means for approaching ergonomic problems and gaining acceptance of their recommendations. This paper describes considerations for selecting participants, requirements of the moderator, and suggestions for designing the focus group session. They are basic focus group elements.

Approaching the millennium: The report the AACP Janus Commission,Bootman J.L.; Hunter R.H.; Kerr R.A.; Lipton H.L.; Mauger J.W.; Roche V.F.,1997,,"The Janus Commission was established by 1995-96 AACP President Mary-Anne Koda-Kimble to scan the health care environment and to identify, analyze, and predict those changes within the environment likely to profoundly influence pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical education, and research; and to alert the academy to both threats and opportunities that such environmental changes present. Throughout its deliberations, the Commission was drawn repeatedly to the pervasive influence of a changing, more intensively integrated and managed health care system on both pharmaceutical education and pharmacy practice. This fundamental change in health care has been the primary influence in the Commission's thinking and recommendations. The Commission believes that a revised model for pharmaceutical education is needed to meet the challenges presented by the changing health care system. In particular, schools and colleges of pharmacy must become true ""activists"" in health care policy, services delivery, and research in order to effectively achieve their missions in professional education. Employing the analogy of the pharmaceutical industry, the Commission suggests the following fundamental areas of emphasis for schools and colleges: • the need for enhanced research and development activities related to the provision of, compensation for, and outcomes of pharmaceutical care; • sustained curricular reform efforts that assure successful ""manufacturing"" of competent and caring pharmaceutical care providers; • aggressive ""marketing"" programs, working in collaboration with the profession of pharmacy, that promote the delivery of pharmaceutical care and foster enhanced practice/education partnerships; and • enhanced interaction with the ""product"" of professional education programs, the pharmacist, to assure that graduates can and will continue to provide effective clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes in the course of their professional careers. Finally drawing upon the previous works of the Pew Health Professions Commission and the AACP Commission to Implement Change in Pharmaceutical Education, the Janus Commission believes that fundamental actions must be taken immediately within the academy to assure the future success of our professional programs and graduates within the evolving health care system. Among these are: • completion of the evolution of the ""values system"" of pharmaceutical education toward producing graduates who are patient-centered providers of pharmaceutical care; • active involvement by administrators and faculty of colleges and schools of pharmacy in health care system decision-making, policy determinations, and research activities; and • creation by colleges and schools of action-oriented business plans that result in effective partnerships with practice organizations and health care delivery systems. The Commission encourages a thorough and critical reading of its report and looks forward to a very healthy, lively, and productive dialogue within the academy over the next several months.",,American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy,scopus-recommendation
Integrated system design and operational decisions for service sector outlets,Banker R.D.; Morey R.C.,1993,10.1016/0272-6963(93)90035-N,"Effective system design for service sector outlets requires the explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of its myriad elements. Facility design decisions as well as tactical, operational choices must recognize the marketing environment, including competitive and demographic factors, and their interactions. The particular design and operational features selected for a given retail service outlet will affect its sales, fixed and variable costs, service levels, efficiency, and profits. We consider a fast food chain contemplating acquiring, building, and operating a new outlet at a particular candidate site, with its own particular environment. We offer a normative approach for this type of decision, which arrives endogenously at the best choices for both design and operational features for the site. The final decision as to whether or not to actually acquire, build, and operate the outlet at the candidate site thus depends on several complex connected choices. Our implementable approach integrates the non-parametric allocative data envelopment analysis methodology with parametric regression analysis to yield a mathematical programming optimization model. We illustrate the approach with actual data from Hardee's, a fast food chain with over 3100 outlets, and an actual candidate site. The recommendations from the approach are compared with those from the conventional approach. A key advantage of our approach is its contrast to conventional approaches for site selection which ignore the more detailed design and operational choices. Additionally, the conventional approaches do not recognize the real possibility that labor and material costs might be affected by these choices. In conventional approaches, two types of errors can occur: (i) an incorrect ""go/no-go"" decision could be recommended for the site in question, and (ii) even if the optimal design choices are coincidentally identified, the forecasted level of annualized profits could be quite different, leading to an incorrect decision or priority about acquiring, building, and operating the candidate outlet. Other key advantages of our suggested approach are that: (i) various substitution possibilities (between more or less capital, labor, material, etc.) are considered, (ii) not only is the best configuration identified, but also a ranking of the possible configurations is available to help in sensitivity analyses and answering ""what-if"" questions, (iii) other specific sites (which serve as the basis for the recommendations) are identified, thereby enabling management (through site visits) to isolate the actual processes and procedures to be employed at the candidate site, and (iv) identify economies of scale possible. In summary, our approach identifies the chain's best practices in different environments, thereby enabling management to factor out poor performances due to flawed installation, lack of proper worker incentives, etc. Also, while the illustration is for a fast food outlet, the approach is equally appropriate for other service outlets, e.g., banks, hospitals, or pharmacies. © 1993.",,,scopus-recommendation

Decision support for real-time telemarketing operations through Bayesian network learning,Ahn J.-H.; Ezawa K.J.,1997,10.1016/S0167-9236(97)00009-2,"Many knowledge discovery systems have been developed in diverse areas, but few systems address the use of knowledge in decision problems explicitly. This paper presents a decision support system for real-time telemarketing operations using the information extracted from the Bayesian network learning model. A prototype decision support system was developed for AT&T customer-contact employees to provide a recommendation regarding the promotion of a telephone discount plan. The system integrated a Bayesian network learning model (knowledge discovery process) and decision-making technique (influence diagram) to provide real-time decision support. A Bayesian network learning model was used to predict a probability of the customer's response from the previous promotion/response history. The influence diagram framework was used to integrate the predicted probability with the cost and benefit related to the possible actions. It was demonstrated that decision support by the Bayesian network learning model itself can be misleading. However, by linking the Bayesian network learning model with rigorous decision-making techniques such as influence diagrams, the decision support system developed in this paper was shown to provide an intelligent decision advice. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",Bayesian network learning; Decision support system; Influence diagrams; Service operations management; Telecommunication applications,Elsevier,scopus-recommendation
"Deworm in winter, spring, summer, or fall? Developing successful internal parasite control programs",Craig T.M.,1997,,"During the past several years, there has been a myriad of recommendations for strategies to control internal parasites of beef cattle. The problem is not so much that many approaches exist but that management strategies for beef cattle vary dramatically throughout North America. The variations in climate, forages, classes of cattle raised, seasonally of breeding, calving, and marketing all contribute to management decisions made by the livestock producer and veterinarian. Thus, no one approach best serves the needs of all livestock producers. In this column, geography and climate, class of cattle raised, and general management schemes are used as the basis for developing guidelines for rational parasite control programs for cattle. The selection of anthelmintic varies based on a number of considerations. The primary species of parasite and the stage of development are the most important criteria. In older cows that have acquired immunity, the relative efficacy of a drug is not as important as it is in naive replacement heifers. The ease of administration, cost of the drugs, and additional benefits (such as ectoparasite control) may aid in determining the best choice of anthelmintic for a particular situation. Controlling Ostertagia ostertagi should be the focus of a beef cattle parasite control program. Other important gastrointestinal nematodes are Cooperia species and Haemonchus. These gastrointestinal nematodes plus the lungworm Dictyocaulus and liver flukes are the most economically important parasites of cattle in North America.",,,scopus-recommendation

Many executives realize the potential value of using salespersons to supply information useful to management decision making. The sales force is familiar with their territories, their customers' needs and sources of information inside customer organizations, their competitors' marketing activities, and trends in product acceptance. The incremental costs and effort required are low compared to other research methods, since information can be submitted within the context of a regular call report system [2, 6, 8]. But salespersons have been found to be inadequate and uncooperative reporters in many instances. Numerous field salespersons believe that reporting infringes on their primary responsibility of selling, and furthermore that management apparently doesn't make use of the resulting information anyway. Thus, while salespersons have access to a wealth of marketing information of potentially great value to the firm, they are often inadequate, unreliable, and unmotivated reporters [4, 5].

Advertising Budgeting and Sales Forecasting: The Timing Relationship,West D.C.,1995,10.1080/02650487.1995.11104598,"This article examines company practice and the advertising budgeting—sales forecasting timing relationship, assessing the key company and organizational variables involved. The data were obtained from a four-page questionnaire mailed to 900 senior marketing executives. Just under three-quarters of companies were found to set their budgets prior or simultaneous to their sales forecasts. The investigation of the remaining companies, those setting their advertising budgets after their forecasts, indicated that the key variables were company size, product category, functional involvement and management process. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that company size and the fragmentation of the budgeting and forecasting decisions may be the most important factors in why some companies set their budgets after the forecast. The main recommendations are that larger companies should strive to link or integrate budgeting—forecasting decisions and that further research should be undertaken to help improve company practices in this respect. © 1995, Advertising Association.

"An aid in selecting the brand, size and other strategic choices for a hotel",Morey R.C.; Dittman D.A.,1997,10.1177/109634809702100107,"The “go/no-go” decision for a candidate property, i.e., whether or not to actually acquire the site, choose the brand (flag), build and operate the hotel, requires the explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of the many myriad elements affecting the property's potential profits. The many facility design decisions (number and mix of rooms, capacity for F&B operations etc.) as well as other strategic choices (e.g., size of marketing program, level of service aimed for) must recognize the site's competitive features and interactions with the above. Also, the particular design and operational features for a given property will affect its different revenue streams, fixed and variable costs, efficiency and profits. The authors consider developers contemplating acquiring a given site, choosing a brand, building and operating a new hotel. They offer a normative approach for this type of decision which arrives endogenously at possibly attractive options for the brand, design and strategic choices for the site. The final decision as to which option to actually use, if any, should be based on subjecting the above identified scenarios, as well as others, to traditional feasibility analyses where judgment and expert opinion are applied. The authors' implementable approach integrates a “best practices” benchmarking methodology with regression analysis to yield a mathematical programming optimization model. A key advantage of this approach lies in its contrast to conventional approaches for site selection which often ignore the more detailed design and strategic choices. The approach deals explicitly with the complex interfaces between marketing and operations management as the endogenous site and competitive environmental factors interact with the endogenous brand and facility design choices. By identifying attractive options to be further explored (that might otherwise be overlooked), several types of errors are avoided: i) an incorrect “go/no go” decision could be recommended for the site in question; ii) even if the right decision to proceed is made, the forecasted level of annualized profits could be in error, leading to an incorrect priority for the activity; iii) the incorrect brand and facility design choices could be made for the site. Other key advantages of the suggested approach are that 1) various substitution possibilities (between more or less capital, labor, materials etc.) are considered; 2) not only is the best brand and configuration identified, but also a ranking of other brands is available if the “best” brand is not available; 3) the “best practices” at other specific sites (which serve as the basis for the recommendations) are identified, thereby enabling management (possibly through site visits) to isolate the actual cultures, processes and procedures to be transported and emulated at the candidate site.

An integrative theory of strategic quality management: A cost-benefit framework for evaluating quality improvement programmes,Wacker J.G.,1989,10.1080/00207548908942530,"Most American firms are concerned with improving their quality. Unfortunately, the current literature does not give a comprehensive theoretical model in order to evaluate each recommendation economically. Because of the lack of a theoretical model and the complexity of quality improvement systems, integrative efforts coordinating marketing and production have been largely ineffective in the strategies of firms, since they have not been subject to traditional cost-benefit analysis. This study develops an integrative strategic quality management theory and a cost-benefit model which put quality improvement programmes into the traditional decision-making framework. Conclusions of this study suggest that quality improvement programmes benefits are cumulative and costs are static. Consequently, evaluation of quality improvement programmes must be dynamic and integrative if they are to be properly evaluated. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,scopus-recommendation
How community drug sales schemes may succeed,Foster S.; Drager N.,1988,,"Almost all of the problems that communities encounter when setting up drug sales schemes can be anticipated by giving careful attention to political, social, economic, managerial and financial factors.; Almost all of the problems that communities encounter when setting up drug sales schemes can be anticipated by giving careful attention to political, social, economic, managerial and financial factors. Problems are often attributable to the inability of governments to provide drugs and to the private sector's unwillingness to sell or distribute them where purchasing power is low. The 1st step is to define the problems of drug supply and their causes. Objectives then become clear. The community has to decide what type of payment it will institute. If prices are set above the people's ability to pay, the scheme will not succeed; if they are set too low, costs will not be fully recovered. Once the type of fee has been chosen, a number of other decisions have to be taken, including selecting drugs and estimating needs, obtaining start-up money, finding a reliable source of drugs, cost-efficient transportation, establishing a community drug depot, and establishing price-setting. The introduction of community-based drug sales schemes may result in gains or losses for various interests, which should be identified at the outset.

The shift in choice strategy is accompanied by a decrease in the extent of attribute-value information search, a finding which is the opposite of that expected on the basis of previous research and theory in the area. Managerial implications of these choice strategies and associated information use are discussed. © 1987.",,,scopus-recommendation

"The impact of outcome, competency and affect on service referral",Johnson M.; Zinkhan G.M.; Ayala G.S.,1998,10.1108/08876049810235432,"Proposes a model to explain consumers' willingness to recommend a service provider. The model considers four predictors of this phenomenon: affect, outcome, competency and courtesy. In a laboratory setting, subjects read and responded to a scenario describing a service encounter of a fictitious individual with a dry cleaner and/or an attorney. The subjects were later asked how likely they were to recommend this service provider to a friend experiencing a similar problem. Separate path analyses were performed to analyze each type of service encounter; and in both scenarios, outcome, competency, courtesy, joy and disgust were found to influence the likelihood that the consumer would recommend a particular service provider. The proposed model accounts for more than 72 percent of the variation in the subjects' decision to recommend. © 1998, MCB UP Limited",Consumer behaviour; Marketing strategy; Recommendations; Service quality; Services marketing,,scopus-recommendation
Informal and formal care for the elderly: Decision determinants and their implications,Mundt J.; Lusch R.F.,1997,10.1300/J026v14n03_05,"In this article, a model is developed of the determinants of elderly health care choice between the options of informal care (i.e., provided by family and friends) and formal care (i.e., care provided via the market). These determinants are: Expertise Capacity, Resource Capacity, Time Capacity, Economic Rewards, Psychic Rewards, Trust, and Control. This model is based on the theoretical work of Lusch, Brown, and Brunswick (1992) in the marketing literature and a variety of empirical findings in health care literature. The Lusch et al. (1992) framework models the general determinants of an entity's choice between fulfilling needs on their own (i.e., internal exchange or self-production) or going to the market to fulfill their needs (i.e., external exchange).

The decision process for retirement center development: Is market research being used effectively?,Gillpatrick T.; Grubb E.,1991,10.1300/J273v04n02_14,"This paper examines the role of market research in the decision process used to invest in continuing care retirement centers (CCRCs). Given changing demographics and the availability of financing, there has been a rapid increase in the number of CCRCs that are being developed. However, a large number of these centers have either failed or are experiencing financial difficulty. Some industry participants have blamed poor or inadequate market research as a factor contributing to the failure of many centers to meet expectations. This paper discusses how the process used to invest in centers and how the motivations of the different actors in the investment decision can influence the role and use of market research. Recommendations are suggested for how industry investors can better understand and use market research in the decision to invest in a retirement center. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,scopus-recommendation
Entry mode selection and its impact on the competition between organic and conventional agricultural products,Pu X.; Xu Z.; Huang R.,2020,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122716,"As the global organic food market continues to grow, so too will the challenges associated with managing organic food supply chains. We consider an entry mode selection problem facing an organic farmer. Specifically, an incumbent conventional farmer is selling its product through an independent retailer on the market. An organic farmer aiming to enter the market faces the problem of selecting between the conventional farmer's retailer and an organic-only retailer. Consumers are heterogeneous in their purchasing valuation of the conventional agricultural product and its organic alternative. Horizontal competition between the two competing farmers is considered under different scenarios. Multiple-stage games are analyzed to study the impact of different cases on the pricing decision and profit of each player. The results show that when the organic agricultural product enters the market through the incumbent conventional retailer, two types of products are sold through a common retailer, the competition between the two farmers will be intensified, and the profit at the retail end will increase. It is always better for the organic farmer to sell an organic agricultural product through an independent organic-only retailer than to sell it through the incumbent conventional retailer. The paper makes two contributions. First, we derive the explicit equilibrium under chain-to-chain competition with piecewise linear demand functions. Second, we link the analytical marketing literature on channel structures with the supply chain literature on chain-to-chain competition and apply them to the food supply chain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Chain-to-chain competition; Entry; Food supply chain; Mode selection,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-robot
Operational and financial decisions within proportional investment cooperatives,Qian X.; Olsen T.L.,2020,10.1287/msom.2018.0762,"Problem definition: We explore the coordination of operational and financial decisions of proportional investment agricultural marketing cooperatives, where members' (farmers') equity is required to be in proportion to their patronage (i.e., produce supplied). Academic/practical relevance: In a cooperative (co-op), operational and financial decisions are inseparable because the co-op's investment capital is linked to its economic transactions with members. We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield.

A critical analysis of e-learning agricultural technical capacity for rural development: lessons from Pakistan,Butt T.M.; Shahbaz B.; Hassan M.Z.Y.; Khan M.,2022,10.1007/s10708-020-10259-4,"Undoubtedly, high demands from food from the world-wide growing population are impacting the environment and putting many pressures on agricultural productivity. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture, enormous farming data, such as agricultural information, capacity buildings, training, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. e-Learning technologies have clearly emerged as development poles for rural development and food security through growths for access to knowledge and exchange through advance agricultural communication tools. A multistage random sampling technique was used by 300 selected e-Learning users from rural areas with a simple linear regression model via SPSS. A comprehensive analysis is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research. One of the main obstacles that farmers were not aware and training of technical information flows in rural development. Therefore, ICTs services and applications have been highly significant for agricultural technical capacity in rural development.

Understanding the adoption dynamics of medical innovations: Affordances of the da Vinci robot in the Netherlands,Abrishami P.; Boer A.; Horstman K.,2014,10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.046,"This study explored the rather rapid adoption of a new surgical device - the da Vinci robot - in the Netherlands despite the high costs and its controversial clinical benefits. We used the concept 'affordances' as a conceptual-analytic tool to refer to the perceived promises, symbolic meanings, and utility values of an innovation constructed in the wider social context of use. This concept helps us empirically understand robot adoption. Data from 28 in-depth interviews with diverse purposively-sampled stakeholders, and from medical literature, policy documents, Health Technology Assessment reports, congress websites and patients' weblogs/forums between April 2009 and February 2014 were systematically analysed from the perspective of affordances. We distinguished five interrelated affordances of the robot that accounted for shaping and fulfilling its rapid adoption: 'characteristics-related' affordances such as smart nomenclature and novelty, symbolising high-tech clinical excellence; 'research-related' affordances offering medical-technical scientific excellence; 'entrepreneurship-related' affordances for performing better-than-the-competition; 'policy-related' affordances indicating the robot's liberalised provision and its reduced financial risks; and 'communication-related' affordances of the robot in shaping patients' choices and the public's expectations by resonating promising discourses while pushing uncertainties into the background. These affordances make the take-up and use of the da Vinci robot sound perfectly rational and inevitable. This Dutch case study demonstrates the fruitfulness of the affordances approach to empirically capturing the contextual dynamics of technology adoption in health care: exploring in-depth actors' interaction with the technology while considering the interpretative spaces created in situations of use. This approach can best elicit real-life value of innovations, values as defined through the eyes of (potential) users. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Affordance; Da Vinci robot; Decision-making; Qualitative ethnographic evaluation; Science, technology and society studies; Surgical device; Technology adoption; The Netherlands",Elsevier Ltd,scopus-robot
"Dealing with climate change and other stressors: small-scale coffee farmers in the Fero-two Peasant Association in the Wensho district, southern Ethiopia",Abebe G.,2021,10.1007/s10708-020-10210-7,"Drawing on evidence from in-depth interviews and a household survey, the paper provides evidence on the farmers’ challenges in production, marketing and prices as well as how farmers perceive and deal with climate change impacts on coffee production in the Fero-two Peasant Association (PA) of the Wensho district of the Sidama region in southern Ethiopia. This includes prolonged dry season, erratic and insufficient rainfall, too early and too late rains and temperature rise. Unexpected heavy rains and snow events as well as weather change-driven pests and diseases negatively affect not only the volume of coffee production and quality but also the prices. The effects of climate change risks add pressure on the existing challenges such as land shortage and fragmentation, declining soil fertility and weeds. Lack of participation in decision-making and corruption are additional challenges for the coffee growers. Although the farmers rely on multiple production-related adaptation responses, most of the deployed strategies to the changing environment are less effective and short-term. The paper concluded that policy interventions should better comprehend the local vulnerability to build resilience and to undertake sustainable agricultural practices for improving the farmers’ adaptive capacity to deal with the effects of climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Adaptation strategies; Climate change impacts; Coffee production challenges; Fero-two PA; Southern Ethiopia; Sustainable agricultural practices; Wensho district,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,scopus-robot
Evaluation of the factors affecting water-saving attitudes of urban life on the verge of the next century: A case study of the mediterranean region of Turkey,Akpinar M.G.; Gul M.; Ceylan R.F.; Gulcan S.,2018,10.2166/washdev.2018.163,"The World Food and Agriculture Organization claims the percentage of the overall world population that will suffer from water scarcity and water stress by 2025 is estimated as 34% and 15%, respectively. Accordingly, it can be estimated that 40% of the 9.4 billion estimated world population will face water shortages by 2050. In this case, the ownership and efficient use of water stand out as common concerns for all communities in the world for today and for the future. In this research, the attitudes of consumers towards water saving were identified and factors that affect these attitudes were analysed within a sample from the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The survey was conducted through a face-to-face survey with 965 households in three Turkish provinces in 2009. SPSS statistical package was used for factor analysis to determine the affecting factors. Variables affecting water-saving decisions were reduced to seven factors via 0.792 KMO value. These seven factors explained 62.18% of the total variation in water-saving consciousness of the target group. Accordingly, it was understood that marketing policies should focus on water crisis awareness, environmental awareness, anxiety about water shortage, residential area characteristics, water pricing, the current awareness level and social willingness on reduction of water use to cope with possible problems. © IWA Publishing 2018.",Consumer attitudes; Factor analysis; Turkey; Water saving; Water usage,IWA Publishing,scopus-robot
Exploring the criteria for a green and smart hotel: insights from hotel managers' perspectives,Akel G.; Noyan E.,2024,10.1108/JHTI-08-2023-0555,"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the adaptations and perspectives of hotel managers regarding green and smart hotel technologies within the context of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review guided the formulation of this study, followed by face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with hotel managers. A total of 17 prepared questions were finalized after examination by two expert academicians. The responses were analyzed using qualitative research methodology and the results were weighted using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Findings: Interviews with sustainability and operational managers yielded insights into environmentally friendly practices and strategies such as reducing energy and water consumption, waste and chemical reduction, supporting local entrepreneurs and adopting smart technologies.

An empirical study examining the relationship between mobile apps’ permissions and ranking; [移动应用权限设计对其市场表现的影响],Lu C.; Xinhui L.; Lele K.,2024,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2024.03.003,"With the development of smart technology, mobile applications have become more universal and important in our daily life. Meanwhile, online privacy protection has attracted rich attention in both academia and practice. Mobile software functions require the authorization of user information. The misuse of private data poses a great threat to users’ privacy safety. It is a difficult task for developers to mitigate users′ concerns and sensitivity to various private data and improve their application performance based on access to the application permission. Based on the “ minimum authority principle,” this paper explores the impact of permission sensitivity and rationality on software performance. The sample data includes 33,772 records of 5,304 software applications in the Xiaomi app store from January 2018 to December 2019. Firstly, according to whether sensitive information of users is involved, permissions are divided into dangerous and normal groups. Based on the permission lists, “0-1” vectors of various permissions are generated. Secondly, four different permission factors are calculated by the spatial distance algorithm to quantify rationality and sensitivity. Finally, this paper empirically explores the impact of permission factors on application ranking based on the panel data fixed effect regression model, which takes application ranking as the decision result of privacy response behavior. Based on the privacy concern theory, this paper links permission invocation with application performance, proving the negative impact of improper permission mechanisms on application performance. The first section introduces the generation method for the four permission factors. The sensitivity indicator refers to whether the permission requires access to users’ private information or illegally shares or sends personal information to others. According to the classification system of the Android Developer Platform, we can quickly get the dummy variables for permission sensitivity. The reasonability indicator refers to whether the type and number of permissions requested by applications match their functional complexity and category average level. The average permission vector for every category is defined as an estimation of “ the least privilege” that best matches the application function. Then, we use the distance from the “ least privilege vector” to denote the irrationality degree. We can obtain four different permission factors by intersecting these two indicators. Mobile applications with too few normal permissions may have functional defects, while those with too many dangerous permissions may cause users′ privacy concerns. The rationality and sensitivity of permissions jointly affect users′ download decisions and application performance. The second part illustrates the influence mechanism of the four permission factors on application ranking. Dangerous and normal permissions have different impacts on mobile application rankings. Considering the particularity of ranking data, this study uses a rologit regression model combined with lag processing and fixed effect to eliminate the impact of other confounding variables. The results show that permission abuse will lower the ranking of applications in this category. The higher the abuse degree, the lower the ranking. With the same degree of rationality, highly sensitive permissions will increase users′ concerns about privacy and security risks. The impact of insufficient permission application cannot be generalized. Insufficient dangerous permission has a positive impact on ranking; however, insufficient normal permission has no significant impact on app ranking. In the third part, the additional model discusses the regulatory effect of apps’ functional descriptions on the influence mechanism. Software with rich functions usually needs to request more permissions. Users enjoy a high sense of self-anonymity in applications with simplified functions, which will reduce their privacy risk concerns. The consequences of security vulnerabilities will be more severe for complex software. Small changes in permissions may drastically affect the user′s privacy risk estimation and the app ranking. In this case, labelling dangerous permissions lower than the average level and normal permissions higher than the average level both have a significant impact on the application ranking. In general, application permission data is closely related to its market performance. While designing software, developers should fully consider the user′s privacy perception level and reduce the use of dangerous permission as much as possible. Without affecting the core functions of the application, a reasonable balance between normal permissions and dangerous permissions can effectively improve the application ranking and marketing performance. Analyzing the performance impact factors and permission evolution process is of great significance to improve app scores and word of mouth. © (2023), (Zhejiang University).

Measuring destination image of an Italian island: An analysis of online content generated by local operators and tourists,Marchi V.; Raschi A.,2022,10.24043/isj.168,"The understanding of destination image is a key point for tourism enterprises, local authorities, and policy makers. This study explores the case of Capraia, a small island located in Tuscany, to analyze how tourists (tourism demand) and local operators (tourism supply) create and communicate the island’s online image. This research quantitatively examines online communication on the two sides of the tourism market to monitor the online destination image of the island of Capraia. To build on previous research in this area, this study adopts a web content mining approach to assess the characteristics of content published online. The main dimensions of destination image (as developed in the literature) are used as a basis to create a dictionary for automated content analysis. A total of 24 tourism promotion websites and 9,180 tourist Instagram posts were analyzed. Findings reveal discrepancies between the image proposed by local operators and that perceived by tourists. Local operators mostly communicate general information to discover the destination, while tourists prioritize communication based on emotional appeal and personal experience on the island. This research aims to provide support for local operators and policy makers in decisions relating to communication and in defining the island image. © Island Studies Journal, 2021.",Capraia island; content analysis; destination image; destination marketing; text mining; tourist consumer behaviour,Island Studies Journal,scopus-text mining
R2M Index 1.0: Assessing the Practical Relevance of Academic Marketing Articles,Jedidi K.; Schmitt B.H.; Ben Sliman M.; Li Y.,2021,10.1177/00222429211028145,"Using text-mining, the authors develop version 1.0 of the Relevance to Marketing (R2M) Index, a dynamic index that measures the topical and timely relevance of academic marketing articles to marketing practice. The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures. Because the index is a work in progress, the authors discuss how to overcome current limitations and suggest correlating the index with citation counts, altmetrics, and readability measures. Marketing practitioners, authors, and journal editors can use the index to assess article relevance, and academic administrators can use it for promotion and tenure decisions (see www.R2Mindex.com).

In addition consumers apply medical protective clothing in a richer and more diverse scenario and the post-purchase evaluation of consumers can not only reflect their demand for medical protective clothing and influence other consumers' purchase decisions on medical protective clothing but also serve as an important basis for relevant enterprises to consider developing and improving their marketing strategies. To deeply understand current consumer' s view and demand for medical protective clothing this paper based on the collected content of 11 513 consumer reviews of 14 Chinese medical protective clothing brands carried out keyword frequency analysis sentiment analysis network analysis and co-occurrence network analysis accurately revealing the consumers' shopping experience perception and demand. The study shows that product quality and express efficiency are the most important factors influencing consumers' post-purchase evaluation followed by merchant services and application scenarios while affordable price only plays an important role in positive evaluation product quality and packaging are of great concern to consumers in the positive evaluation consumers are quite content with product quality workmanship material size comfort breathability product packaging and gifts express efficiency delivery and logistics speed price cheap price and merchant service customer service staff service attitude and service response speed . The consumers also express the need to buy medical protective clothing for timely and safe protection in daily life during the epidemic and in scenarios such as air travel. In the negative evaluation consumers' dissatisfaction is mainly focused on product quality express efficiency and merchant service such as poor product quality the clothing is too large to be worn the product and related gifts are broken when received and the product material is thin poor express efficiency slow delivery and logistics after the product is ordered and poor merchant service poor customer service attitude no timely response to information omission of products slow invoicing and difficulty to refund . This exploratory study provides new research ideas for consumer experience and valuable reference for the marketing management practices of medical protective clothing enterprises. This study provides valuable reference information for medical protective clothing companies' product and service improvement logistics partner selection product design and development and price marketing strategies by digging deeper into the content of medical protective clothing consumer reviews and outlining more clearly the concerns of consumers in the process of purchasing medical protective clothing. © 2023 China Silk Association.

The EconoMining project at NYU: Studying the economic value of user-generated content on the internet,Ghose A.; Ipeirotis P.,2009,10.1057/rpm.2008.56,"An important use of the internet today is in providing a platform for consumers to disseminate information about products and services they buy, and share experiences about the merchants with whom they transact. Increasingly, online markets develop into social shopping channels, and facilitate the creation of online communities and social networks. Till date, businesses, government organisations and customers have not fully incorporated such information in their decision making and policy formulation processes, either because the potential value of the intellectual capital or appropriate techniques for measuring that value have not been identified. Increasingly, although, this publicly available digital content has concrete economic value that is often hidden beneath the surface. For example, online product reviews affect the buying behaviour of customers, as well as the volume of sales, positively or negatively. Similarly, user feedback on sites such as eBay and Amazon affect the reputation of online merchants and, in turn, their ability to sell their products and services. Our research on the EconoMining project studies the economic value of user-generated content in such online settings. In our research program, we combine established techniques from economics and marketing with text mining algorithms from computer science to measure the economic value of each text snippet. In this paper, we describe the foundational blocks of our techniques, and demonstrate the value of user-generated content in a variety of areas, including reputation systems and online product reviews, and we present examples of how such areas are of immediate importance to the travel industry. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.",E-commerce; Econometrics; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; User-generated content,,scopus-text mining
How to identify product defects and segment consumer groups on an online auto forum,Sun B.; Mao H.; Yin C.,2022,10.1111/ijcs.12784,"China's automotive industry has entered a stage of great growth. Owing to the widespread and rapid information dissemination of online automotive forums, they have become an important source for manufacturers to collect product defect information and understand consumer preferences. The purpose of this study is to investigate car defect information and consumer preferences from online automotive forums and segment consumers based on consumer preferences, which holds great promise as a means for companies to improve product design and consumer relationship management. Based on text data of China's top-ranked Pacific Auto Network, we applied the LDA model, sentiment analysis, text classification, and cluster analysis methods to determine the influencing factors of automobile consumers’ purchasing behavior, identified automobile product defects, and subdivided consumer groups. The results show that the factors affecting consumers’ car buying behavior are low fuel consumption, affordable price, superior performance, fashionable appearance, and comfortable use. Car product defects are mainly reflected in the three aspects of the car's performance, comfort, and configuration; there are six kinds of consumer groups: price seekers, fuel consumption seekers, performance seekers, comfort seekers, cost performance seekers, and appearance seekers. Of these, cost performance seekers make up the largest proportion, and they constitute the largest group of intention purchasers. These findings can help enterprises develop targeted product improvement programs, but also provide a decision-making basis for enterprises to achieve precision marketing. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",auto forum; consumer groups; online review; product defects; text mining,John Wiley and Sons Inc,scopus-text mining
Elevating B2B branding in a global context: Integrating existing literature and proposing a forward-thinking conceptual framework,Marvi R.; Zha D.; Foroudi P.,2024,10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.06.006,"This study aims to evaluate B2B branding in a global context by constructing a framework for future research, practitioners, and brand managers operating in international B2B markets.

Emotion detection and its influence on popularity in a social network-based on the American TV series friends,Porter I.; Galam B.; Ramon-Gonen R.,2023,10.1007/s13278-023-01133-5,"4.59 billion people worldwide use social networks. Over a billion new posts are uploaded every day to Facebook’s applications (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). Social networks play a central role in consumption and marketing, politics, and social aspects. They affect users' decision-making processes, emotions, and behavior. Content on social media can include, for example, movies, pictures, and texts. The emotion expressed in the post content has an influence on the exposed individuals. Emotions can cause the user exposed to the content to follow another user, view more content raised by a certain user, share a post, or express support (or lack of support), thus affecting the popularity of the user. In this work, we examined the relationship between emotions expressed by a character and popularity measures. As a case study, we analyzed the texts presented in the popular series “Friends” over ten seasons. We found that women in the series express more emotions in general and, in particular, more emotions of anticipation, joy, trust, and fear. The findings show the relationship between different emotions expressed in the content and various popularity measures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Emotion detection; Popularity measures; Social network analysis; Text mining,Springer,scopus-text mining
"Past, present, and future research on self-service merchandising: a co-word and text mining approach",Muñoz-Leiva F.; Rodríguez López M.E.; Liebana-Cabanillas F.; Moro S.,2021,10.1108/EJM-02-2019-0179,"Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bibliometric analysis; Co-word analysis; Point-of-sale marketing; Scopus; Web of Science,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-text mining
A Text Mining-Based Review of Cause-Related Marketing Literature,Guerreiro J.; Rita P.; Trigueiros D.,2016,10.1007/s10551-015-2622-4,"Cause-related marketing (C-RM) has risen to become a popular strategy to increase business value through profit-motivated giving. Despite the growing number of articles published in the last decade, no comprehensive analysis of the most discussed constructs of cause-related marketing is available. This paper uses an advanced Text Mining methodology (a Bayesian contextual analysis algorithm known as Correlated Topic Model, CTM) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 246 articles published in 40 different journals between 1988 and 2013 on the subject of cause-related marketing. Text Mining also allows quantitative analyses to be performed on the literature. For instance, it is shown that the most prominent long-term topics discussed since 1988 on the subject are “brand-cause fit”, “law and Ethics”, and “corporate and social identification”, while the most actively discussed topic presently is “sectors raising social taboos and moral debates”. The paper has two goals: first, it introduces the technique of CTM to the Marketing area, illustrating how Text Mining may guide, simplify, and enhance review processes while providing objective building blocks (topics) to be used in a review; second, it applies CTM to the C-RM field, uncovering and summarizing the most discussed topics. Mining text, however, is not aimed at replacing all subjective decisions that must be taken as part of literature review methodologies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Cause-related marketing; Text mining; Topic models,Springer Netherlands,scopus-text mining

Text mining-based four-step framework for smart speaker product improvement and sales planning,Park J.; Yang D.; Kim H.Y.,2023,10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103186,"The smart speaker market, which is considered an early-stage market, is expected to grow rapidly as smart speakers become a part of daily life. Consequently, manufacturers are trying to dominate the market. To achieve this, they must analyze users' reactions to their products and find insights for product improvement through comparison with competitors. We propose a four-step methodological framework for identifying meaningful opinions from a large number of online user reviews. First, network analysis is conducted to compare differences between brands. Next, through topic modeling, the attributes of speakers that users consider the most crucial are extracted for each brand. Third, sentiment analysis is conducted to examine how users' emotional polarities differ for each attribute. Through this, product improvement and product sales plans can be derived. Finally, in order to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each brand, brand positioning is conducted and user opinions that have changed along with the evolution of the speaker's generation are analyzed. Our study identified the factors that positively or negatively affect the experience of smart speaker users. In addition, the proposed method is highly useful because it can be used to derive insights from a large amount of user opinion data regardless of the search term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Brand positioning; Decision support; Online review; Sales planning; Smart speaker; Text analysis,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-text mining
Consumer perceived value preferences for mobile marketing in China: A mixed method approach,Huang L.; Mou J.; See-To E.W.K.; Kim J.,2019,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.02.007,"This study aimed to identify a new framework for consumer perceived value (CPV) and evaluate the dynamics of relative importance of different dimensions of CPV in the context of mobile marketing. Laddering interviews were conducted to capture the essence of CPVs, and then text-mining techniques were applied to extract key consumer values from the interviews. Six dimensions of CPV, namely, design, emotional, functional, monetary, guarantee, and social, were identified. The construct validity of these six dimensions was demonstrated through a rigorous sorting process. A best–worst scaling (BWS) survey was then implemented based on these six value dimensions to investigate consumers’ preference for each dimension in three critical decision-making phases of mobile marketing campaigns. Statistical analysis of the BWS data showed that significant dynamic differences exist among these six value dimensions in each phase. Gender difference and consumer heterogeneity were also presented.

Strategic orientation and firm risk,Bhattacharya A.; Misra S.; Sardashti H.,2019,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2019.01.004,"Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO) have received substantial conceptual and empirical attention in the marketing and management literature and both orientations have consistently been linked to stronger financial performance. Yet the way in which market-oriented firms seek to achieve superior rents is substantively different from that of entrepreneurially oriented firms which could lead to differential impacts of EO and MO on firm risk. In this study, the authors employ a text mining technique to assess firms' EO and MO and examine the impact of these two strategic orientations on shareholder risk outcomes. The results show that while EO increases idiosyncratic risk, MO decreases it. However, only EO decreases systematic risk. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that a firm's decisions regarding strategic orientation should be examined in light of both likely risks and returns in order to make appropriate resource allocation decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm risk; Market orientation; Shareholder return; Text analysis,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-text mining

Where does pride lead? Corporate managerial hubris and strategic emphasis,Kim M.; Xiong G.; Kim K.-H.,2017,10.1007/s11747-017-0547-4,"A firm’s strategic emphasis on value creation versus appropriation, which is typically reflected in its resource allocation between R&D and advertising, is a central corporate decision that significantly influences financial performance. However, the drivers of such decisions remain underexplored. This study identifies a significant predictor of strategic emphasis, namely, corporate managerial hubris, and reveals some of its boundary conditions. Leveraging a unique dataset based on text mining of press releases issued by over 400 firms across 13 years, the authors demonstrate that high corporate managerial hubris predicts low strategic emphasis on advertising relative to R&D. However, this effect is mitigated significantly by firm maturity, corporate governance, and industry-level strategic emphasis. The results provide novel insights into the effects of hubris on firm spending, the situations wherein marketing decisions tend to be subject to managers’ psychological bias, the means of preventing over- or under-investment in marketing strategy, and the recruitment and training of managers. © The Author(s) 2017.",Advertising; Corporate managerial hubris; R&d; Strategic emphasis,Springer New York LLC,scopus-text mining
Artificial intelligence (AI) competencies for organizational performance: A B2B marketing capabilities perspective,"Mikalef, P; Islam, N; Parida, V; Singh, H; Altwaijry, N",2023,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.113998,"The deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been accelerating in several fields over the past few years, with much focus placed on its potential in Business-to-Business (B2B) marketing. Early reports highlight promising benefits of AI in B2B marketing such as offering important insights into customer behaviors, identifying critical market insight, and streamlining operational inefficiencies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding con-cerning how organizations should structure their AI competencies for B2B marketing, and how these ultimately influence organizational performance. Drawing on AI competencies and B2B marketing literature, this study develops a conceptual research model that explores the effect that AI competencies have on B2B marketing capabilities, and in turn on organizational performance. The proposed research model is tested using 155 survey responses from European companies and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results highlight the mechanisms through which AI competencies influence B2B marketing capabilities, as well as how the later impact organizational performance.",Artificial intelligence; B2B marketing; AI competencies; Core competencies theory,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-ai
Machine learning and AI in marketing - Connecting computing power to human insights,"Ma, LY; Sun, BH",2020,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.04.005,"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of some AI and statistical classification methods for a marketing case,"Montgomery, D; Swinnen, G; Vanhoof, K",1997,10.1016/S0377-2217(97)00122-7,"Recent progress in data processing technology has made the accumulation and systematic organization of large volumes of data a routine activity. As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development. This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain. The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module. When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people.

AI credibility and consumer-AI experiences: a conceptual framework,"Khan, AW; Mishra, A",2024,10.1108/JSTP-03-2023-0108,"PurposeThis study aims to conceptualize the relationship of perceived artificial intelligence (AI) credibility with consumer-AI experiences. With the widespread deployment of AI in marketing and services, consumer-AI experiences are common and an emerging research area in marketing. Various factors affecting consumer-AI experiences have been studied, but one crucial factor - perceived AI credibility is relatively underexplored which the authors aim to envision and conceptualize.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a conceptual development approach to propose relationships among constructs, supported by 34 semi-structured consumer interviews.FindingsThis study defines AI credibility using source credibility theory (SCT). The conceptual framework of this study shows how perceived AI credibility positively affects four consumer-AI experiences: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social interaction. Perceived justice is proposed to mediate this effect.

AI anthropomorphism and risk aversion in financial decision-making","Cui, YY",2022,10.1108/IJBM-09-2021-0451,"Purpose This research examines whether anthropomorphizing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots alters consumers' risk preferences toward financial investment options involving differential risks. Design/methodology/approach An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3). Originality/value Anthropomorphizing AI has undeniable relevance in the contemporary marketing landscape, such as humanoid robotics and emotion AI algorithms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is part of a new generation of technologies that can facilitate competitive advantage but currently there is a lack of evidence regarding AI applications in relation to B2B SMEs in Middle East countries. Therefore, this study empirically examines antecedents to, and consequences of, successful acceptance of AI practices by B2B SMEs in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model based on the technology-organisation-environment framework is developed which considers the impact of AI enablers and AI readiness on the acceptance of AI practices, and the impact of this on relational governance, performance, and SMEs' AI-based business customer interaction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling of survey data collected from B2B SMEs (n = 392). The results showed that, of the AI enablers, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by both technology roadmapping and attitude but not professional expertise. Of the AI readiness variables, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by infrastructure and awareness but not technicality. The acceptance of AI practices was found to significantly affect AI-enabled relational governance and performance, and SME's business customer AI-based interaction.

The AI transformation of product innovation,"Cooper, RG",2024,10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.03.008,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13-15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade. This article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better go-to-development investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies. Despite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the early adopter stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues. High uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered. The article ends with a call to action, aimed at both practitioners and academics: AI is the most significant innovation in our lifetime!

We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers' service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition.

When Post Hoc Explanation Knocks: Consumer Responses to Explainable AI Recommendations,"Chen, CD; Tian, AD; Jiang, RC",2023,10.1177/10949968231200221,"Artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations are becoming increasingly prevalent, but consumers are often reluctant to trust them, in part due to the black-box nature of algorithm-facilitated recommendation agents. Despite the acknowledgment of the vital role of interpretability in consumer trust in AI recommendations, it remains unclear how to effectively increase interpretability perceptions and consequently enhance positive consumer responses. The current research addresses this issue by investigating the effects of the presence and type of post hoc explanations in boosting positive consumer responses to AI recommendations in different decision-making domains. Across four studies, the authors demonstrate that the presence of post hoc explanations increases interpretability perceptions, which in turn fosters positive consumer responses (e.g., trust, purchase intention, and click-through) to AI recommendations. Moreover, they show that the facilitating effect of post hoc explanations is stronger in the utilitarian (vs. hedonic) decision-making domain. Further, explanation type modulates the effectiveness of post hoc explanations such that attribute-based explanations are more effective in enhancing trust in the utilitarian decision-making domain, whereas user-based explanations are more effective in the hedonic decision-making domain.",AI recommendations; post hoc explanations; trust; consumer responses; interpretability perceptions; hedonic/utilitarian decision making,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-ai

To better understand the intertwined nature of AI and sustainability from a strategy perspective, this research conceptually develops a novel AI x Sustainability framework by drawing from the nested sustainability model and integrating insights from different literature streams. It then applies this framework to six leading Big Tech companies (i.e., Amazon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, and SAP) by conducting a comprehensive document analysis of 69 documents describing 244 individual AI x Sustainability initiatives to reveal whether and how these companies appear to follow specific AI x Sustainability strategies. Lastly, an exploratory survey with potential tech companies' clients ( N = 192) sheds light on how clients perceive tech companies' communicated strategic positioning based on the framework. The research provides new theoretical insights, serves as a blueprint for other tech companies, including implications for their AI x Sustainability positioning, and offers a variety of future research directions.",AI; Sustainability; Strategy; Strategic management; Twin transition; Tech companies,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-ai
Exploring the Role of AI in B2B Customer Journey Management: Towards an IPO Model,"Khvatova, T; Appio, FP; Ray, S; Schiavone, F",2023,10.1109/TEM.2023.3284532,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a pervasive technology and companies are increasingly urged to adopt and implement it in order to thrive and innovate. While much has been researched on the role AI can play in business-to customer (B2C) settings, a research gap exists when it comes to business-to-business (B2B), which is characterized by higher complexity, increasing number of players, and larger volumes of data. In such a context, an emerging issue deals with the possibility of understanding how companies can leverage AI to aptly manage the customer journey. This aspect touches on many organizational activities, so managers must be aware of existing solutions, process implications, and potential outcomes. In this article, we present an empirical study of 61 Indian B2B companies and provide an input-process-output (IPO) framework to help managers understand and profit from AI solutions while effectively managing the customer journey. We add value to literature on using AI to improve the customer journey in B2B settings. The developed IPO model can be used as a roadmap for introducing AI in managing customer journeys as well as a strategic instrument for organizational change and design.",Artificial intelligence (AI); business-to-business (B2B); customer journey; input-process-output (IPO) model; multiple cases,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,wos-ai

Brand deletion: How the decision-making approach affects deletion success,"Temprano-García, V; Rodríguez-Escudero, AI; Rodríguez-Pinto, J",2018,10.1016/j.brq.2018.03.003,"Literature on brand deletion (BD), a critical and topical decision within a firm's marketing strategy, is extremely scarce. The present research is concerned with the decision making process and examines the effect on BD success of three different approaches to decision making - rational, intuitive and political - and of the interaction between the rational and political approaches. The moderating effect of the type of BD - i.e., total brand killing or disposal vs. brand name change - is also analyzed. The model is tested on a sample of 155 cases of BD. Results point to positive effects on BD success of both rationality and intuition, and a negative effect of politics. Findings also indicate that the negative impact of political behavior on BD success is minimized in the absence of evidence and objective information and when the BD is undertaken through a brand name change.

Stochastic optimal budget decision for advertising considering uncertain sales responses,"Du, R; Hu, Q; Ai, S",2007,10.1016/j.ejor.2006.02.031,"Firms are faced with uncertain sales responses even though they advertise appropriately. To help marketing managers make optimal budget decisions in this situation, we develop a stochastic model, depicting the problem of advertising budget decision as a special Markov decision process where a new objective, maximizing expected market utility, is proposed. In the model we introduce a two-dimension state variable including accumulative sales, which vary randomly with advertising budget, and the predicted probability that an advertising campaign obtains a full sales response. We make an analysis of the model on the premise of growing infinite market potential, deriving the property of optimal policies and that of optimal value function. These results are successfully used to make advertising budget decisions for a private university in Xi'an, China. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examine the link between firms' focus on AI in their 10-K reports and their gross and net operating efficiency. 10-K reports are a salient source of insight into an array of issues in accounting and finance research, yet remain relatively overlooked in marketing. Drawing upon economic and marketing theory, we develop a guiding framework to show how firms' AI focus could be related to gross and net operating efficiency. We then use a system of simultaneous equations to empirically test the relationship between AI focus and operating efficiency. Our findings confirm that US-listed firms are in a state of impending transformation with regards to AI.

The study aims to understand the customers' perception of using AI-based technologies in banks. Satisfaction is the first step towards acceptability and retention of customers towards lesser-known technology and automated process implemented in banks. The constructs of the study are referred from the technology acceptance model to define their level of acceptance and are divided into independent and dependent variables. The independent variables are transparency, awareness level, security, efficiency, trust, and social influence, and the dependent variable is customer satisfaction. Therefore, the structural equation model was developed from the customers' (N = 500) response to retail banks in northern India. The study reveals that trust is the most significant factor for greater customers' satisfaction towards AI-enabled technologies in banks, followed by the customers' awareness level. The security of AI-based banks is the least important contributor to customer satisfaction. Additionally, the control variables, i.e., age and gender, govern the customers' perception. Understanding customer acceptability towards AI-based technology in retail banks is rare in emerging nations such as India. The findings provide insight into the formulation of compliance. It also highlights the regulation applicable to digital banks by the competent authority in India.

The dual effect of anthropomorphism on customers' decisions to use artificial intelligence devices in hotel services,"Alsaad, A",2023,10.1080/19368623.2023.2223584,"This study investigated the impact of anthropomorphism on customers' decisions to use artificial intelligence (AI) devices in hotels, along with other traditional predictors. The study's model considered the co-occurrence of positive and negative effects of anthropomorphism, including social presence and identity threats, which compete to control evaluative attitudes toward AI devices. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the model using data from 363 participants. The results showed that anthropomorphism positively enhances social presence, leading to higher performance expectancy and positive emotions toward AI devices. Anthropomorphism also entails identity threats, resulting in increased effort expectancy and negative emotions. These trade-offs highlight the need for hotels to consider how customers perceive and respond to anthropomorphized AI devices during service delivery and to choose the level of anthropomorphism accordingly. This study highlights the benefits and cost trade-offs inherent in anthropomorphism and explains how they affect the evaluative attitudinal responses toward AI devices.",technology acceptance; artificial intelligence; anthropomorphism; social presence; identity threat,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-ai

On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers' interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.",apathy; artificial intelligence; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; medical decision-making; personalization; prosociality,WILEY,wos-ai

In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel word-of-machine effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1-4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person's unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human-AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

WHEN AND HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUGMENTS EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY,"Jia, N; Luo, XM; Fang, Z; Liao, CC",2024,10.5465/amj.2022.0426,"Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI-human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees' creativity in answering customers' questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees' interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills.",,ACAD MANAGEMENT,wos-ai

However, regardless of whether the first interaction is highly personalized or not, they prefer follow-up visits with a human doctor, as mediated through empathy. Study 2 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, the anterior cingulate cortex shows greater activation in a highly (vs. low) personalized interaction, the activation of which is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit that provider. Furthermore, the temporal occipital fusiform cortex shows greater activation in consultations with a human doctor (vs. medical AI), regardless of the interaction's level of personalization. The level of activation is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit with the initial provider. The findings suggest that medical AI cannot currently replace human doctors and that human doctors remain consumers' choice for medical consultations and treatment.",anthropomorphism; artificial intelligence; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; healthcare,WILEY,wos-ai
"Order and scale of market entry, firm resources, and performance","Rodríguez-Pinto, J; Gutiérrez-Cillán, J; Rodríguez-Escudero, AI",2007,10.1108/03090560710737633,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether order and scale of market entry influence a new product's market and financial performance, and how marketing and R&D resources strengthen or weaken these effects. Design/methodology/approach - Through a mail survey, data were collected on a sample of 136 product launches by Spanish manufacturing firms. A moderated hierarchical regression analysis enabled the assessment of the relevance of order and scale as well as their interactions with marketing and R&D resources to explain a product's competitive position. Moreover, a mediation analysis allowed us to determine whether market entry strategy (indirectly) affects financial performance. Findings - The analyses show that pioneering firms and those entering the market with a full-scale launch achieve advantages in terms of competitive position, and that this variable mediates the relationship of order and scale with profitability. The empirical results also reveal that such advantages are conditioned by the availability of marketing and R&D resources. Practical implications - The decisions regarding order and scale of market entry are contingent. Managers involved in the planning of a new product launch should be knowledgeable about their firm's resources and capabilities before determining when and how to enter the market. Originality/value - Many papers study the effects of order-of-entry on market share, but other dimensions of a new product launch strategy, such as scale, have largely been ignored. The research examines the effects of both variables on competitive position and profitability. This is also one of the first studies that explores the moderating effect exerted by resources and capabilities in the launch strategy-performance relationship.",market entry; new products; competitive strategy; profit; Spain,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,wos-ai

Conspicuous by Its Absence: Diagnostic Expert Testing Under Uncertainty,"Dai, TL; Singh, S",2020,10.1287/mksc.2019.1201,"We study the problem a diagnostic expert (e.g., a physician) faces when offering a diagnosis to a client (e.g., a patient) that may be based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability or supplemented by a diagnostic test-conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) tools alike-revealing the client's true condition. The expert's diagnostic ability (or type) is private information. The expert is impurely altruistic in that the expert cares about both the client's utility and the expert's own reputational payoff that depends on the peer perception of the expert's diagnostic ability. The decision of whether to perform the test, which is costly for the client, provides the expert with an opportunity to influence that perception. We show a unique separating equilibrium exists in which the high-type expert does not resort to diagnostic testing and offers a diagnosis based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability, whereas the low-type expert performs the test. Furthermore, we establish that high-type expert may skip necessary diagnostic tests to separate them from the low-type expert. Interestingly, the effect of reputational payoff on undertesting is nonmonotonic, and the desire to appear of high type leads to undertesting only when the reputational payoff is intermediate. Our results also suggest a more altruistic expert may be more likely to engage in undertesting. Furthermore, efforts to encourage testing by providing financial incentives or by raising malpractice lawsuit concerns may, surprisingly, help fuel undertesting in the equilibrium. Our paper sheds new light on barriers to the adoption of AI tools aimed at enhancing physicians' diagnostic decision making.",game theory; health; undertesting; diagnostic expert; information asymmetry; artificial intelligence,INFORMS,wos-ai
Role of artificial intelligence in customer engagement: a systematic review and future research directions,"Gupta, Y; Khan, FM",2024,10.1108/JM2-01-2023-0016,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to comprehend how AI aids marketers in engaging customers and generating value for the company by way of customer engagement (CE). CE is a popular area of research for scholars and practitioners. One area of research that could have far-reaching ramifications with regard to strengthening CE is artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, it becomes extremely important to understand how AI is helping the marketer reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. Design/methodology/approachA detailed approach using both systematic review and bibliometric analysis was used. It involved identifying key research areas, the most influential authors, studies, journals, countries and organisations. Then, a comprehensive analysis of 50 papers was carried out in the four identified clusters through co-citation analysis. Furthermore, a content analysis of 42 articles for the past six years was also conducted. FindingsEmerging themes explored through cluster analysis are CE concepts and value creation, social media strategies, big data innovation and significance of AI in tertiary industry. Identified themes for content analysis are CE conceptualisation, CE behaviour in social media, CE role in value co-creation and CE via AI. Research limitations/implicationsCE has emerged as a topic of great interest for marketers in recent years. With the rapid growth of digital media and the spread of social media, firms are now embarking on new online strategies to promote CE (Javornik and Mandelli, 2012). In this review, the authors have thoroughly assessed multiple facets of prior research papers focused on the utilisation of AI in the context of CE. The existing research papers highlighted that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants offer real-time interaction capabilities, swiftly addressing inquiries, delivering assistance and navigating customers through their experiences (Cheng and Jiang, 2022; Naqvi et al., 2023). This rapid and responsive engagement serves to enrich the customer's overall interaction with the business. Consequently, this research can contribute to a comprehensive knowledge of how AI is assisting marketers to reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. This study also sheds light on both the attitudinal and behavioural aspects of CE on social media. While existing CE literature highlights the motivating factors driving engagement, the study underscores the significance of behavioural engagement in enhancing firm performance. It emphasises the need for researchers to understand the intricate dynamics of engagement in the context of hedonic products compared to utilitarian ones (Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut, 2020). CEs on social media assist firms in using their customers as advocates and value co-creators (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Sawhney et al., 2005). A few of the CE themes are conceptual in nature; hence, there is an opportunity for scholarly research in CE to examine the ways in which AI-driven platforms can effectively gather customer insights. As per the prior relationship marketing studies, it is evident that building relationships reduces customer uncertainty (Barari et al., 2020). Therefore, by using data analysis, businesses can extract valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviour, equipping them to engage with customers more effectively. Practical implicationsThe rapid growth of social media has enabled individuals to articulate their thoughts, opinions and emotions related to a brand, which creates a large amount of data for VCC. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a radical way of providing value content to users. It expands on a broader concept of how software and algorithms work like human beings. Data collected from customer interactions are a major prerequisite for efficiently using AI for enhancing CE. AI not only reduces error rates but, at the same time, helps human beings in decision-making during complex situations. Owing to built-in algorithms that analyse large amounts of data, companies can inspect areas that require improvement in real time. Time and resources can also be saved by automating tasks contingent on customer responses and insights. AI enables the analysis of customer data to create highly personalised experiences. It can also forecast customer behaviour and trends, helping businesses anticipate needs and preferences. This enables proactive CE strategies, such as targeted offers or timely outreach. Furthermore, AI tools can analyse customer feedback and sentiment across various channels. This feedback can be used to make necessary improvements and address concerns promptly, ultimately fostering stronger customer relationships. AI can facilitate seamless engagement across multiple digital channels, ensuring that customers can interact with a brand through their preferred means, be it social media, email, or chat. Consequently, this research proposes that practitioners and companies can use analysis performed by AI-enabled systems on CEB, which can assist companies in exploring the extent to which each product influences CE. Understanding the importance of these attributes would assist companies in developing more memorable CE features. Originality/valueThis study examines how prominent CE and AI are in academic research on social media by identifying research gaps and future developments. This research provides an overview of CE research and will assist academicians, regulators and policymakers in identifying the important topics that require investigation.",Artificial intelligence; Customer engagement; Social media; Value co-creation; Literature review,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-ai

"CONTENT SAMPLING, HOUSEHOLD INFORMEDNESS, AND THE CONSUMPTION OF DIGITAL INFORMATION GOODS","Hoang, AP; Kauffman, RJ",2018,10.1080/07421222.2018.1451958,"Technology and media are delivering content that is transforming society. Providers must compete for consumer attention to sell their digital information goods effectively. This is challenging, since there is a high level of uncertainty associated with the consumption of such goods. Service providers often use free programming to share product information. We examine the effectiveness of content sampling strategy used for on-demand series dramas, a unique class of entertainment goods. The data were extracted from a large set of household video-on-demand (VoD) viewing records and combined with external data sources. We extended a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to handle censored data, which permitted us to explore the main causal relationships. Relevant theories in the marketing and information systems disciplines informed our research on consumer involvement and informedness for decision making under uncertainty, the consumption of information goods, and seller strategies for digital content. The results show that content sampling stimulates higher demand for series dramas, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Samples of the series reveal quality information to consumers and allow them to assess preference fit directly. As a result, they become more informed about their purchase decisions. Also, households seem to be willing to pay more to be better informed, and informed households tend to purchase more. This suggests that content providers should invest in strategies that help consumers to understand the preference fit of information goods.",content sampling; data censoring; digital entertainment; household informedness; information asymmetry; information goods; online content; preference fit; propensity score matching; video-on-demand,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-ai

"It's not fake, it's biased: insights into morality of incentivized reviewers","Rynarzewska, AI",2019,10.1108/JCM-02-2018-2570,"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to uncover morality and dynamics of community of incentivized reviewers who primarily review products on Amazon.com. and, as of late, on various social media platforms. This study is important because it uncovers unknown dynamics that shapes consumer morality and drives reviewer's ethics. Given the fact that consumers heavily rely on reviews, findings of this paper are of great values to practitioners, consumers and policymakers and highlight potential area of research particularly related to morality. Design/methodology/approach This study, conducted over a period of 1.5 years, relying on a netnography to collect data and thematic analysis to make sense of data, uncovered behaviors that contribute to the J-shape distribution of reviews on Amazon.com and questionable reviewer ethics. Findings Findings of this study suggest suppressed consumer morality driven by desire to gain benefits in form of free products and manipulation of the review system in an attempt to boost sales and the prevalence of biased reviews. The findings shed light on overconsumption driven by an opportunity to receive free products, introduction of review bias into the public domain and attempts to manipulate Amazon's algorithms. Research limitations/implications Findings of this study carry tremendous implications for average consumer who relies on consumer-generated reviews without realizing the presence of bias. Furthermore, the findings shed light of unfair business practices of sellers who demand high ratings. Finally, the findings suggest that there is opportunity for policymakers to address a loophole because incentivized reviewers, regardless of Federal Trade Commission regulations, may be operating in gray area, much less controlled than advertising. Originality/value This study is unique because while other studies may conduct similar netnographies of reviewing communities, this community was examined during a span that covered the incentivized reviewing boom, Amazon's ban on incentivized reviewing, and the revival of reviewing activity post ban.

Health State Transitions and Longevity Effects on Retirees' Optimal Annuitization,"Ai, J; Brockett, PL; Golden, LL; Zhu, W",2017,10.1111/jori.12168,"The interplay between longevity risk and health state transitions for retirees' optimal annuitization decisions is investigated. Using a life-cycle framework incorporating wealth levels, bequest motives, and consumption floors created by government subsidies, we examine how increased longevity in conjunction with an individual's health state transition process impacts annuity purchase decisions. Health state transition matrices are estimated from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) data. The effects of increased longevity on annuitization decisions are considered when longevity is both accompanied by increased time spent in healthier states (morbidity compression) or experienced by more time in unhealthy states (morbidity expansion). We find that retirees' annuity demand is affected by wealth, initial health status, and expansion or compression of morbidity. Wealthier retirees have higher annuity demand when health shocks are considered, and increased longevity increases demand even more when retirees expect an expansion or slight morbidity compression. With health shocks and expectations of severe morbidity compression considered, the opposite effect might occur. Thus, an annuity can help retirees hedge health shock costs when slight compression or expansion of morbidity occurs. For retirees with lower wealth, the consumption floor provided by governmental subsidies will create a decreased propensity to annuitize.",,WILEY,wos-ai

Empirical support is offered for the notion of vulnerability as a fluid state and the role of the timing of decisions as a source of vulnerability is described.",Consumer vulnerability; customer screening; financial services; segmentation; economic recession; credit crunch,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-ai
Beyond theory: a systematic review of strengths and limitations in technology acceptance models through an entrepreneurial lens,"Rahimi, RA; Oh, GS",2024,10.1057/s41270-024-00318-x,"In today's fiercely competitive business landscape, startups face numerous challenges in achieving scalability and sustainability. The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents promising solutions to these challenges. However, understanding the intricacies of technology acceptance within the startup environment becomes paramount. Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) have long served as foundational frameworks for understanding technology adoption and integration, but their effectiveness is hindered by inherent limitations. These limitations demand further exploration, particularly when viewed through the entrepreneurial lens. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations inherent in TAM and its extensions, alongside other prominent technology acceptance models. By incorporating an entrepreneurial perspective, the analysis reveals additional challenges stemming from the dynamic nature of startup ecosystems. From a pragmatic standpoint, this paper provides actionable insights for technology-driven entrepreneurial organizations to navigate innovation and technology adoption decisions more intelligently. From a theoretical perspective, it contributes to the refinement and evolution of technology acceptance models, particularly in the context of entrepreneurial ventures. In light of these limitations, the paper offers strategic recommendations for future research endeavors. These include encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, contextualizing models to suit startup dynamics, conducting longitudinal studies to capture evolving user perceptions, accounting for individual differences in technology adoption, and validating emerging models to reflect contemporary realities. Emphasis is placed on the entrepreneurial imperative of agility and adaptability in navigating the ever-changing landscape of technology acceptance. Moreover, the paper underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and delineates practical implications for organizations and practitioners aiming to sustain technology acceptance and successful implementation within dynamic startup environments. By addressing these constraints, researchers can pave the way for the development of more robust and comprehensive models, better equipped to clarify and predict technology acceptance and usage patterns. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical need for ongoing refinement and innovation within the realm of technology acceptance, providing actionable insights to propel both scholarly discourse and entrepreneurial practice forward.",Technology acceptance model; Entrepreneurship; Limitations; Startup environment; Innovation adoption,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,wos-ai
Effects of dominance transitions on advice adherence in professional service conversations,"Wang, HS; Yim, CK",2019,10.1007/s11747-019-00664-8,"For many professional services, advice adherence is a necessary condition for achieving service success for both customers and service providers. Despite their pivotal roles in value co-creation, typical conversational interactions often lead to low adherence. We propose that enabling a dominance transition, from provider dominance in the pre-advice stage to customer dominance in the post-advice stage, enhances advice adherence because it increases customers' perceived common ground. Furthermore, providers' consultation focus, customers' prior knowledge, and customers' perceived adherence effort moderate this process. Using mixed methods, including both empirical modeling and controlled and field experiments, we validate the proposed model in various contexts (healthcare, financial services, and fitness and wellness counseling). The findings establish several theoretical contributions and offer managerial implications for improving advice adherence by managing dominance transitions in conversational interactions more effectively through training service providers or even programming AI chatbots.",Advice adherence; Professional service conversations; Conversational dominance; Dominance transitions; Customers' perceived common ground,SPRINGER,wos-ai
Exploring Consumers' Discontinuance Intention of Remote Mobile Payments during Post-Adoption Usage: An Empirical Study,"Koghut, M; AI-Tabbaa, O",2021,10.3390/admsci11010018,"Despite being critical to continuous technology usage, research on remote mobile payments (m-payments) post-adoption usage has received much less attention. Furthermore, information systems usage research has traditionally been positively oriented, generally assuming that the inhibiting and enabling factors influencing technology usage as being the opposite sides of one dimension, which may result in overlooking antecedents to technology continuance. Therefore, this study aims to explore the inhibiting factors that may directly influence customers' intention to discontinue m-payments during post-adoption usage. Drawing on behavioral theories, information systems, and marketing research, this study explores the inhibiting factors directly influencing consumers' intentions to discontinue using m-payments. Survey data were collected from 254 current users in the UK and the PLS-SEM technique is employed to test hypotheses. The results show that poor quality of system, information, and service, as usage inhibitors, directly influence consumers' discontinuance intentions. Importantly, usage frequency is found to have no moderating effect on the inhibitors of continuance intention, supporting the notion about different and asymmetric effects that negative factors can have on technology usage compared to positive ones. This interesting finding suggests that negative user experience will have different and asymmetric effects on intentions to use m-payments than positive user experience.",mobile payment; discontinuance intention; usage inhibitors; information system success model; asymmetric effect,MDPI,wos-ai
"Towards profitable customized solutions in small firms: a matter of relationships, modularity and expertise","Rodríguez-Escudero, AI; Camarero-Izquierdo, C; Redondo-Carretero, M",2023,10.1108/JBIM-03-2021-0147,"Purpose The decision concerning the degree of product and service customization is crucial, yet has scarcely been studied for small businesses in business-to-business (B2B) contexts. Although such a decision allows relationships with potential customers to be strengthened, it might involve high opportunity costs given the investment required. This paper aims to analyse the profitability of customization undertaken by small businesses in terms of cost-benefit and examine the drivers of profitable customized projects vis-a-vis the ability to strengthen relationships with clients (relationship investment and customer involvement) and the firm's resources related to processes and technology (expertise and modularity). Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected from 140 small Spanish firms involved in two sectors characterized by the offer of customized solutions: information and professional, scientific and technical services. Findings Analysis reveals that customer involvement in the customized solution, even when it requires investing in equipment, time or human resources has a positive effect on customization and ultimately on profitability, as the cost of this customer interaction is lower than the revenue it provides. Likewise, supplier investment in the relationship allows for a solution that is adapted to the client, although it requires a cost associated with investing in specific assets. Such costs cancel out the positive indirect effect through the customized solution. Finally, expertise enables appropriate use of the flexibility derived from modularity to satisfy customer requirements, with both being key company resources for driving profitability through customized solutions. Originality/value This study makes a contribution to the domain of customization. The authors extend current knowledge on B2B customization by proving that small firms can use their available capabilities and knowledge to achieve a successful customization strategy.",Customization; Small businesses; Relationship investment; Expertise; Modularity,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-ai

The consideration of internal links between the entry dimensions, together with their effect on the different performance variables, will enable us to determine the existence of mediating effects, which up until now have barely been examined in the literature. We test our model on a cross-sectional sample of 136 manufacturing firms, applying structural equation modeling based on the Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology.

Antecedents and consequences of using information from customers involved in new service development,"Carbonell, P; Rodriguez-Escudero, AI",2014,10.1108/JBIM-04-2012-0071,"Purpose - The current research aims to analyze antecedents and consequences of using the information provided by customers involved in new service development (NSD). It also seeks to examine the moderating effect of technological turbulence on the antecedents and consequences of information use. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from service firms in a variety of industrial sectors. Unit of analysis was a NSD project in which current or potential customers were involved during its development process. A self-administered mail survey was used to collect the data. A total of 102 complete questionnaires were returned. The proposed model was tested using partial least squares. Findings - The results indicate that the instrumental use of the information collected from customers involved in NSD can lead to higher service advantage and service newness and in turn to higher market performance. Findings reveal that higher recording and reviewing of information collected from customers involved in NSD result in greater use of the information during the NSD process. An important result is that under technologically turbulent environments, recording and reviewing information from customers involved in NSD is less likely to result in a higher instrumental use of such information. Finally, the authors' results show that when technological turbulence is high the instrumental use of information from customers involved in NSD has lower value for both service advantage and service newness. Originality/value - Findings confirm the importance of customer involvement for NSD in a business context. Using the information from customers involved in NSD to resolve specific problems or make decisions regarding NSD projects can result in enhanced service performance. Moreover, information processing capabilities are key antecedents to instrumental information use. Finally, managers should be aware of the potential negative effect of technological turbulence.",New service development; Customer involvement; Information processing behaviors; Information use; New service performance; Technological turbulence,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-ai
A transaction cost approach for public procurement,"Rokkan, AI; Haugland, SA",2022,10.1108/JBIM-09-2019-0393,"Purpose This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework based on transaction cost economics that identifies key factors shaping public agencies' governance of supplier relationships and related performance implications. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents an extended transaction cost framework for research on public procurement (PP) with a corresponding set of propositions. Transaction cost theory and specific features of and challenges to the PP function identified in extant literature constitute the main elements of the framework. Findings This conceptual paper makes three sets of proposals. First, public agencies tend to rely on market governance of supplier relationships and when PP deploys non-market governance, such governance tends to be of a unilateral (vs bilateral) kind. Second, increases in purchasing competence and autonomy of PP and particularly if implemented in tandem, will reduce PP's overreliance on market governance and increase PP's use of non-market governance. Third, PP should perform better for less complex transactions - and when contracting complexity relates to safeguarding of specific assets rather than when complexity relates to environmental and behavioral uncertainty. Increases in competence and autonomy should increase PP's performance, particularly for complex transactions. Practical implications Public agencies may be in a better position to align governance solutions with transaction complexities by developing their procurement competence, decentralizing procurement decisions and increasing the flexibility of national and international procurement regulations. Private companies selling to public agencies need to be aware of and able to adapt to PP practices such as extensive use of market governance and unilateral governance as the primary form of non-market governance. Social implications The paper discusses how public agencies can improve procurement performance through better alignment of governance of supplier relationships with transaction attributes and thereby increase the quality of public services. Originality/value The paper relies on a well-established theoretical perspective, enabling identification (and, potentially, correction) of governance misalignment in the public sector.",Public sector; Governance; Procurement; Transaction costs,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-ai

We systematically analyze the effects of sample size, scale length, strength of item intercorrelations, and scale dimensionality. We demonstrate the beneficial effects of sample size on alpha's standard error and of scale length and the strengths of item intercorrelations (effects that are substitutes in their benefits) on both alpha and its standard error. Our findings also speak to this adage: Heterogeneity within the item covariance matrix (e.g., through multidimensionality or poor items) negatively impacts reliability by decreasing the precision of the estimation. We also examined the question of equilibrium scale length, showing the conditions for which it is optimal to add no items, or one, or multiple items to a scale. In terms of best practices, we recommend that researchers report a confidence interval or standard error along with the coefficient alpha point estimate.",measurement; survey research; reliability; coefficient alpha,INFORMS,wos-ai
Artificial Intelligence and Human Talent in Decision Making in the Sphere of Marketing in an Enterprise,"Sobocinska, M",2021,10.7172/1644-9584.91.5,"Purpose: The analysis of the content of publications concerning decision-making processes in an enterprise indicates that one of the tasks of modern management is to identify effective solutions based on the synergy of human and technological resources that support decision-making processes. This also applies to marketing, which is subject to virtualization related both to its concept and instruments, as well as marketing activities. The purpose of the paper is to show the role of artificial intelligence and human talent in decision making in the field of marketing in an enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: Critical literature review; the research procedure that is based on the review of the literature is focused on formulating the answers to the following questions: - What factors determine the effective implementation of artificial intelligence as a technology supporting decision-making processes in the sphere of marketing in enterprises? - What are the identified models of application of artificial intelligence and human talent in making decisions in enterprises? Findings: The use of the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence in supporting marketing decisions brings many benefits, but it also requires overcoming mental and cultural barriers. It should be emphasized that relying on artificial intelligence in decision-making processes does not mean eliminating people, especially the talented ones, because it is the employee who can revise the decision-making criteria or state that the algorithm on the basis of which decisions are made in the company is outdated. Research limitations/implications: Empirical verification of the proposed model would allow for identifying the role performed by talented employees and algorithms in decision-making processes in the era of development of innovative IT solutions along with determination of the hierarchy of factors stimulating these processes.

MODERN DIGITAL MARKETING TRENDS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY FORMATION,"Hnoievyi, VH; Koren, OM",2021,10.32342/2074-5354-2021-1-54-5,"The article has dealt with the current trends of communication aspects of company's relations with the customers. The emphasis is placed on the necessity to review the companies' marketing strategies, in particular, due to communication constraints and the corresponding changes in the format of both direct and feedback with the customers. Restrictive measures have changed the format of competition, having created the conditions for its concentration in cyberspace. Changes in the nature of interpersonal communication predetermined by the limited personal activity and the introduction of remote forms of interaction, have generated demand for innovative ways of communication with customers. Other factors that require the adjustment of marketing strategies include the emergence of new behavioral capabilities of consumers associated with the intensive development of digital communication channels. It has been noted that in the digital communication environment, digital platforms provide the main format of communication with the existing customer base and potential customers. In addition, prompt acquisition and processing of data on purchasing behavior of customers allows companies to increase significantly the sensitivity of marketing research and optimize their own marketing decisions. Among the areas of increasing targeting and personalization of product offerings, the use of elements of artificial intelligence and voice search has been accentuated. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence greatly facilitates and simplifies the work of marketers on the processing and initial analysis of the growing flow of digital marketing data, as well as provides greater efficiency. It has been concluded that widespread use of voice assistants in e-commerce requires companies to rethink radically their approaches to internal data processing, IT investment and customer engagement strategies. Active integration of chatbots into various communication platforms is able to make them universal tools for both business and consumers, which will allow them to become a familiar part of the user experience. Implementation of virtual reality and augmented reality elements in the interface of company websites can significantly diversify the process of collecting information by users and push them to unplanned purchases. It has been indicated that the growing standards of personalization and new rules of customer confidentiality will continue to require companies to be flexible and introduce new technologies in order to adapt permanently their business to new conditions. Focusing on building trust with customers based on digital communications will enable companies to create a long-term integrated marketing strategy and concentrate on the multi-channel nature of customer experience.",marketing strategy; digital marketing; innovations; personalization; digital channels; artificial intelligence; voice search; virtual reality; augmented reality,ALFRED NOBEL UNIV,wos-artificial intelligence

Recommendation agents assist consumers in their online grocery shopping decisions by analyzing data on preferences and behaviors. This research highlights that while recommendation agents can reduce choice overload and make purchase decisions easier for consumers, they are also associated with higher uncertainty in decision-making. Three experimental studies confirmed that purchases aided by recommendation agents are perceived as more uncertain and reduced perceptions of control over the choices explain this outcome. Furthermore, lower choice satisfaction and purchase intentions are confirmed as consequences of perceived uncertainty.

However, retailers struggle with the implementation of such technologies in brick-and-mortar stores. Against this background, the present study investigates the impact of a smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant application, which uses personalized recommendations and explainable artificial intelligence features on customer shopping experiences. Design/methodology/approach The authors follow a design science research approach to develop a shopping assistant application artifact, evaluated by means of an online experiment (n = 252), providing both qualitative and quantitative data. Findings Results indicate a positive impact of the augmented reality shopping assistant application on customers' perception of brick-and-mortar shopping experiences. Based on the empirical insights this study also identifies possible improvements of the artifact. Research limitations/implications This study's assessment is limited to an online evaluation approach. Therefore, future studies should test actual usage of the technology in brick-and-mortar stores. Contrary to the suggestions of established theories (i.e. technology acceptance model, uses and gratification theory), this study shows that an increase of shopping experience does not always convert into an increase in the intention to purchase or to visit a brick-and-mortar store. Additionally, this study provides novel design principles and ideas for crafting augmented reality shopping assistant applications that can be used by future researchers to create advanced versions of such applications.

Bayesian network classifiers for identifying the slope of the customer lifecycle of long-life customers,"Baesens, B; Verstraeten, G; Van den Poel, D; Egmont-Petersen, M; Van Kenhove, P; Vanthienen, J",2004,10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00043-2,"Undoubtedly, customer relationship management has gained its importance through the statement that acquiring a new customer is several times more costly than retaining and selling additional products to existing customers. Consequently, marketing practitioners are currently often focusing on retaining customers for as long as possible. However, recent findings in relationship marketing literature have shown that large differences exist within the group of long-life customers in terms of spending and spending evolution. Therefore, this paper focuses on introducing a measure of a customer's future spending evolution that might improve relationship marketing decision making. In this study, from a marketing point of view, we focus on predicting whether a newly acquired customer will increase or decrease his/her future spending from initial purchase information. This is essentially a classification task. The main contribution of this study lies in comparing and evaluating several Bayesian network classifiers with statistical and other artificial intelligence techniques for the purpose of classifying customers in the binary classification problem at hand. Certain Bayesian network classifiers have been recently proposed in the artificial intelligence literature as probabilistic white-box classifiers which allow to give a clear insight into the relationships between the variables of the domain under study. We discuss and evaluate several types of Bayesian network classifiers and their corresponding structure learning algorithms. We contribute to the literature by providing experimental evidence that: (1) Bayesian network classifiers offer an interesting and viable alternative for our customer lifecycle slope estimation problem; (2) the Markov Blanket concept allows for a natural form of attribute selection that was very effective for the application at hand; (3) the sign of the slope can be predicted with a powerful and parsimonious general, unrestricted Bayesian network classifier; (4) a set of three variables measuring the volume of initial purchases and the degree to which customers originally buy in different categories, are powerful predictors for estimating the sign of the slope, and might therefore provide desirable additional information for relationship marketing decision making.

MARKETING STRATEGIES IN THE BANKING SERVICES SECTOR WITH THE HELP OF DATA SCIENCE,"Zatonatska, T; Hubska, M; Shpyrko, V",2022,10.21272/mmi.2022.2-11,"Competition between marketing strategies of enterprises shifts to the use of artificial intelligence and begins to be considered in the context of competition between Data Science projects. Therefore, the issue of developing methodology and building a model in a particular area is relevant, which will make the project quite effective and ensure the achievement of goals for the company. The banking services market has a certain specificity of consumer behaviour, so forming marketing strategies is a somewhat complex process. Thus, banks face the task of maintaining the loyalty of their existing customers and attracting new ones. This article aims to build a marketing strategy to attract new customers in the banking sector using Data Science tools. The result of the study is the construction of two econometric models of the different bank's credit products: cash loans and credit cards, which determine the influence of various factors on this process and helps to distribute the advertising budget between different types of advertising. Using the built model, it was determined that advertising campaigns directly affect the increase in the number of new customers in the bank and the overall growth of brand knowledge about the banking institution in society. In addition, the determined weights of each influencing factor helped form an advertising budget, which increased customer inflows by 12%, with an average ROI of 3.18. Taking all into account, the model had shown its effectiveness in organising the bank's advertising campaign when decisions were made using Data Science technologies. The results obtained based on the models give a fairly clear understanding of the factors influencing the inflow of new customers in the bank, which will model the distribution of the budget for advertising campaigns in future periods and predict their effectiveness.

Centrality and community detection: a co-marketing multilayer network,"Fernandes, A; Gonçalves, PCT; Campos, P; Delgado, C",2019,10.1108/JBIM-11-2017-0266,"Purpose Based on the data obtained from a questionnaire of 595 people, the authors explore the relative importance of consumers, checking whether socioeconomic variables influence their centrality, detecting the communities within the network to which they belong, identifying consumption patterns and checking whether there is any relationship between co-marketing and consumer choices. Design/methodology/approach A multilayer network is created from data collected through a consumer survey to identify customers' choices in seven different markets. The authors focus the analysis on a smaller kinship and cohabitation network and apply the LART network community detection algorithm. To verify the association between consumers' centrality and variables related to their respective socioeconomic profile, the authors develop an econometric model to measure their impact on consumer's degree centrality. Findings Based on 595 responses analysing individual consumers, the authors find out which consumers invest and which variables influence consumers' centrality. Using a smaller sample of 70 consumers for whom they know kinship and cohabitation relationships, the authors detect communities with the same consumption patterns and verify that this may be an adequate way to establish co-marketing strategies. Originality/value Network analysis has become a widely used technique in the extraction of knowledge on consumers. This paper's main (and novel) contribution lies in providing a greater understanding on how multilayer networks represent hidden databases with potential knowledge to be considered in business decisions. Centrality and community detection are crucial measures in network science which enable customers with the highest potential value to be identified in a network. Customers are increasingly seen as multidimensional, considering their preferences in various markets.",Centrality; Co-marketing; Community detection; Multilayer networks,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-artificial intelligence
Cognitive computing based ethical principles for improving organisational reputation: A B2B digital marketing perspective,"Behera, RK; Bala, PK; Rana, NP; Kizgin, H",2022,10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.11.070,"Cognitive computing is ushering in the fourth industrial revolution through its promises of improved accuracy, scalability and personalisation. Therefore, business-to-business (B2B) organisations are wavering in the decision for adoption into their digital marketing initiatives. However, embracing moral rules and/or moral judgments in their digital marketing innovation can be challenging, since making mistakes could damage reputations. Therefore, this study applies the ethical principles of cognitive computing in B2B digital marketing business-centric ethical challenges. An integrated theoretical framework grounded on multidisciplinary studies is proposed. The primary data were collected from 300 respondents within B2B businesses. The results of this research led to the conclusion that good ethical practices are essential for the improvement of both organisational effectiveness and organisational reputation. Increased organisational reputation delivers a competitive edge in fast-growing marketplaces.

EXPERT SYSTEMS IN MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION - ARE THEY REALLY DIFFERENT FROM DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,"EDWARDS, JS",1992,10.1016/0377-2217(92)90273-C,"Historically, the fields of Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems grew up from different backgrounds; Management Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence, respectively. As a result, many people still regard them as unrelated fields, although Operational Researchers are working in both of them. Expert Systems in particular have found it difficult to escape from an image of being isolated; not just from Decision Support Systems, but from all other types of computer system. Successful applications appeared to be confined to very well-defined tasks; either small systems for tasks of an operational nature, or large systems requiring expensive specialised computer support. The spread of Expert Systems into management and administrative applications from the scientific/technical domains of the early systems has been very slow. The view put forward in this paper is that for Expert Systems to be applied to problems in management or administration, the traditional 'closed-world' picture of an Expert System is usually inadequate. The real manifestation of the Expert System's role (and indeed that of the human expert) involves much more negotiation and interaction than in scientific/ technical domains. The consequences for the resulting system are that it looks much more like the traditional picture of a Decision Support System than a classic standalone Expert System. The argument will be illustrated by reference to examples of 'Expert System' developments, including systems for production control, crime pattern analysis, telephone marketing, and the drawing up of contracts.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; PRACTICE,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,wos-artificial intelligence
Unsupervised KDD to creatively support managers' decision making. with fuzzy association rules: A distribution channel application,"Orriols-Puig, A; Martínez-López, FJ; Casillas, J; Lee, N",2013,10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.03.005,"To be competitive in contemporary turbulent environments, firms must be capable of processing huge amounts of information, and effectively convert it into actionable knowledge. This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis.

THE CHALLENGES OF SCANNER DATA,"BARON, S; LOCK, A",1995,,"Data capture at point of sale, using laser scanning technology, is now commonplace in retail outlets in developed economies. The volume of data collected is enormous (a single UK grocery superstore carries over 15 000 different lines, each with a unique 13 digit barcode and will sell 600 000 items per week). It has been recognized that, where point of sale data can be translated into meaningful information, there is scope for efficiency savings and exploitable competitive advantage. In UK grocery retailing the uses of scanner data have concentrated on operational aspects such as improved ordering systems and staff scheduling. There have, however, been many recent studies, predominantly in the USA, which have examined, using scanner data, the relationship between marketing variables (price, display, advertising, coupons, and other promotions) and customer purchasing behaviour. This paper presents an overview of these studies and identifies the opportunities for operational researchers to further the understanding of such relationships through modelling and data handling.",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; MARKETING; RETAILING,STOCKTON PRESS,wos-artificial intelligence

Algorithm Overdependence: How the Use of Algorithmic Recommendation Systems Can Increase Risks to Consumer Well-Being,"Banker, S; Khetani, S",2019,10.1177/0743915619858057,"Consumers increasingly encounter recommender systems when making consumption decisions of all kinds. While numerous efforts have aimed to improve the quality of algorithm-generated recommendations, evidence has indicated that people often remain averse to superior algorithmic sources of information in favor of their own personal intuitions (a type II problem). The current work highlights an additional (type I) problem associated with the use of recommender systems: algorithm overdependence. Five experiments illustrate that, stemming from a belief that algorithms hold greater domain expertise, consumers surrender to algorithm-generated recommendations even when the recommendations are inferior. Counter to prior findings, this research indicates that consumers frequently depend too much on algorithm-generated recommendations, posing potential harms to their own well-being and leading them to play a role in propagating systemic biases that can influence other users. Given the rapidly expanding application of recommender systems across consumer domains, the authors believe that an appreciation and understanding of these risks is crucial to the effective guidance and development of recommendation systems that support consumer interests.",artificial intelligence; consumer decision making; decision aids; human-computer interaction; recommender systems,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-artificial intelligence

Little attention has been paid to the customers' and job seekers' perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers' attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers' intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital's unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies. The topic is worth exploring as key market players (such as Oracle) recognize autonomous technologies as the most ground-breaking innovation that will shape business in the coming years.",autonomous systems; intelligent technologies; marketing; innovation; employer branding; customer behavior,"UNIV SPLIT, FAC ECONOMICS",wos-artificial intelligence

While an organization's reputation is impacted by the absence of an ethical identity, its financial success is unaffected. Extant literature has not thrown a spotlight on social and environmental performance which indicates that less focus has been given by academics than by practitioners. To fill the lacuna in the existing literature, this study examines the relationships between corporate ethical identity, corporate brand identity, social and environmental performance. The study uses a deductive research approach and develops hypotheses which are further tested using variance based structural equation modeling. The study offers a distinctive contribution to ethics theory and stakeholder theory by showing that developing an ethical identity requires more than just adhering to moral guidelines and upholding open communication. Companies must show that they are ethically responsible towards society. The study provides evidence of the influence corporate brand identity has on environmental and social performance.

Navigating the Digital Transformation of Commercial Banks: Embracing Innovation in Customer Emotion Analysis,"Sun, YY; Zhang, Q",2024,10.1007/s13132-024-01938-5,"The rapid development of science has ushered the society into the era of the digital economy, profoundly altering the habits and behaviors of empowered digital citizens. This transformation is particularly evident in the financial sector, where Internet companies have spearheaded the growth of Internet finance, offering non-professional, highly autonomous, cost-effective, and accessible financial services. Traditional banks face stiff competition from internal and cross-border rivals, compelling them to embark on digital transformation journeys to stay relevant. This research paper delves into the critical relationship between technology forecasting and social change, exploring the impact of gender imbalances on FinTech innovation. It also examines innovative e-commerce marketing models driven by big data and artificial intelligence, catalyzing advancements in the financial field. The digitalization of banks encompasses multiple facets, including decision-making, ecosystem development, channel optimization, process enhancement, data center construction, and infrastructure fortification. Central to this transformation is the understanding of customer emotions, a task made more intelligent through natural language processing (NLP) technology. We employ NLP techniques to analyze customer voice data and discern emotional states, including one-hot vector representation and Word2Vector models, alongside Bi-LSTM and attention processes. This approach significantly enhances our ability to tailor policies and products in real time, ensuring a more personalized customer experience. Also, the paper emphasizes the importance of establishing robust data governance systems, innovating talent development mechanisms, controlling digital risks, and optimizing customer acquisition strategies in the digital transformation journey. It also addresses the changing landscape of e-commerce architecture, highlighting the significance of logistical expertise and security considerations in international Internet sales. This research advances our understanding of how commercial banks can leverage technology and innovation to serve the real economy effectively.

Service employees' STARA awareness and proactive service performance,"Hur, WM; Shin, Y",2024,10.1108/JSM-03-2023-0115,"PurposeThis study aims to explore the role of frontline service employees' (FSEs) awareness that their job can be substituted by smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms (STARA) in their job autonomy and proactive service performance and when these relationships can be buffered. Drawing on the cognitive appraisal theory of stress, the study examined the mediating relationship between FSEs' STARA awareness, job autonomy and proactive service performance and the moderating effects of self-efficacy and resilience on this relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe authors administered two-wave online surveys to 301 South Korean FSEs working in various service sectors (e.g. retailing, food/beverage, hospitality/tourism and banking). The Time 1 survey measured respondents' STARA awareness, self-efficacy, resilience and job autonomy, and the Time 2 survey assessed their proactive service performance.FindingsFSEs' STARA awareness negatively affected their subsequent proactive service performance through decreased job autonomy. The negative association between STARA awareness and job autonomy was weaker when FSEs' self-efficacy was high than when it was low. While the authors observed no significant moderation of resilience, the author found a marginally significant three-way interaction between STARA awareness, self-efficacy and resilience. Specifically, STARA awareness was negatively related to job autonomy only when both self-efficacy and resilience were low. When either self-efficacy or resilience was high, the association between STARA awareness and job autonomy became nonsignificant, suggesting the buffering roles of the two personal resources.Research limitations/implicationsGiven that the measurement of variables relied on self-reported data, rater biases might have affected the findings of the study. Moreover, the simultaneous measurement of STARA awareness, self-efficacy, resilience and job autonomy could preclude causal inferences between these variables. The authors encourage future studies to use a more rigorous methodology to reduce rater biases and establish stronger causality between the variables.Practical implicationsService firms can decrease FSEs' STARA awareness through training in the knowledge and skills necessary to work with these technologies. To promote FSEs' proactive service performance in this context, service firms need to involve them in decisions related to STARA adoption and allow them to craft their jobs. Service managers should provide FSEs with social support and exercise empowering and supportive leadership to help them view STARA as a challenge rather than a threat.Originality/valueDistinct from prior research on STARA awareness and employee outcomes, the study identified proactive service performance as a key outcome in the STARA context. By presenting self-efficacy and resilience as crucial personal resources that buffer FSEs from the deleterious impact of STARA awareness, the study provides practitioners with insights that can help FSEs maintain their job autonomy and proactive service performance in times of digitalization and automation.",STARA awareness; Self-efficacy; Resilience; Job autonomy; Proactive service performance,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-artificial intelligence
Genuine Liking or the Need for Closure? The Differential Effects of Consumers' TV Drama Viewing Motivations on Commercial Viewership,"Shi, Y; Wang, TT",2019,10.1080/08997764.2021.1883916,"Television advertising effectiveness constitutes a key marketing issue. Advertisers rely on program TV ratings to determine advertisement placement because consumers' decisions to view TV commercials are largely influenced by their TV program-viewing behavior. However, high program viewership of television dramas does not always entail high commercial viewership; consumers' motivations for drama consumption play a critical role. In the context of TV drama viewing, we build a two-stage structural model that distinguishes two motivations for TV drama consumption-viewers' liking for a drama and the need for cognitive closure-and demonstrate their contrasting effects on consumers' commercial-viewing behavior. Although both motivations enhance drama-viewing behavior, consumers exhibit an enhanced (vs. diminished) tendency to watch subsequent commercials when they possess heightened liking for the drama (vs. the need for cognitive closure). These findings contribute to extant research on TV commercial-viewing behavior by distinguishing the roles of different drama-viewing motivations. Based on the model estimation results, we conduct a series of simulation studies to generate rich managerial implications. Managerial practices for both advertisers and TV networks are discussed.",,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-artificial intelligence

The authors selected five Italian companies to portray the diverse characteristics, practices and policies of relevant stakeholders before reaching saturation with the issues explored.FindingsThe authors find that interactions among buying center members are more effective with greater collaboration and exchange (as opposed to competition and a struggle for power). Virtual/hybrid relations require greater intra-group cooperation, whereas diverse backgrounds and collaborative interactions help the flexibility and performance of the buying center. Greater use of technology produces certainty and automation, but it may also cause overload and biases that can be solved with the ability to analyze and clear responsibility for decisions.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors studied only five Italian companies in this study. Future research in other countries with diverse cultural and socio-economic conditions and methods would help extend this research.Practical implicationsThe findings would improve the understanding of the challenges of adopting new purchase process technologies that would help automate routine tasks, produce useful data and support decision-making.Originality/valueUnlike prior studies, this study uses an exploratory design to study the evolution of buying centers in SMEs to seek deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by SMEs because of the growing use of emerging technologies.",Buying center; Digital communication; Digital technologies; Hybrid selling,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-artificial intelligence
How video conferencing promotes preferences for self-enhancement products,"Huang, L; Pricer, L",2024,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2023.09.001,"The pandemic has led to a significant increase in the use of video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Yet little is known about the impact of video conferencing on subsequent consumer decisions. Across six studies, we examine the effects of video conferencing in both consumption (e.g., sales) and nonconsumption (e.g., school and work) contexts and find that video conferencing can trigger greater interest in products that can enhance the self - physically, intellectually, and/or mentally - due to heightened social appearance anxiety. This effect is attenuated when technology allows users to reduce social appearance anxiety (e.g., the use of ring lights or the ability to turn off web cameras) but accentuated when social anxiety is increased (e.g., the use gallery/ speaker views) and is more pronounced among consumers who are low in self-esteem.

"Impact of high involvement work systems in shaping power, knowledge sharing, rewards and knowledge perception of employees","Nguyen, M; Pontes, N; Malik, A; Gupta, J; Gugnani, R",2024,10.1108/JKM-04-2023-0345,"PurposeAmid challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, fostering employee creativity has become paramount for organizations. However, there is a scarcity of research on digitalization of the workplace and its implications for implementing high involvement work systems (HIWSs) in organizations, particularly in relation to their impact on employee outcomes, such as creativity and job satisfaction. Additionally, limited attention has been given to the role of job level and organizational type in driving change during times of adversity. This study aims to examine the factors within the HIWSs model using the PIRK model - power (P), information sharing (I), rewards (R) and knowledge (K) to explore how HIWSs shape the extent of power individuals have over their employment, the sharing of information, the types of rewards that engage and motivate employees and the knowledge required to fulfil employees' responsibilities effectively, both individually and collectively.Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative research methodology, this study uses thematic analysis for data collection, analysis and interpretation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 48) served as the primary data collection method. Using the theoretical lenses of high-involvement practices and employee perceptions of PIRK, the effect on employee creativity and job satisfaction is analysed.FindingsThe findings of this study reveal that employee creativity is significantly influenced by how employees perceive power, information, rewards and knowledge. Moreover, the study highlights the role of transformational and transactional leadership in shaping employee perceptions of power, information and knowledge within HIWSs. A high perception of PIRK is found to positively impact employee job satisfaction.Research limitations/implicationsThis study offers valuable insights for human resource management (HRM) professionals seeking to make informed decisions regarding best practices and initiatives for enhancing employee outcomes in the post-COVID era. By recognizing the pivotal role of HIWSs and their influence on employee perceptions, organizations can strategically implement HIWSs to foster creativity and job satisfaction. Furthermore, this research contributes to the existing literature by examining the interplay between HIWSs and the PIRK model in the context of workplace digitalization, emphasizing the importance of adapting HRM practices to address the evolving needs of the modern workforce.Originality/valueThis study will help HRM professionals in making informed decisions on the best practices and initiatives to enhance employee outcomes in the post-COVID era.

Consumers' multistage data control in technology-mediated environments,"Zimmermann, J; Martin, KD; Schumann, JH; Widjaja, T",2024,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2023.09.004,"New technologies create novel tensions, such as between providing consumers with greater control over their personal data and enhancing the technological sophistication of firms' offerings (e.g., through automation). Resolving such control-related tensions requires specific, comprehensive conceptualizations and measures of consumers' perceived data control. Drawing from conceptual notions of control, the authors develop a novel, multistage account of control across consumer-firm data exchanges in various traditional (active and passive) and new, hybrid data disclosure settings. By distinguishing, defining, and operationalizing control activities pertaining to the collection, submission, access, and use of personal data, this article proposes a means to capture consumers' subjective control perceptions. Study 1, focused on quantitative measure validation, establishes that consumers can distinguish the four data control activities; Study 2, a qualitative account using depth interviews, reveals that consumers identify the four control activities unprompted and across diverse situations. Collectively, these findings present both theoretical and practical implications. This article concludes with a robust set of research directions for an expanded understanding of data control activities in technology-mediated environments. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Impact of ethics training and audits on the relationship quality of business-to-business partners in sharing economy,"Bag, S; Gupta, S; Srivastava, G; Sivarajah, U; Kumar, A",2022,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.08.019,"Sharing economy is flourishing and increasingly customers are shifting towards using instead of owning products and services. The objective of our research is to empirically prove that low organizational trust can trigger strict organizational practices such as ethics training and audits but excessive use of both of these practices can negatively impact the relationship quality in sharing economy. In doing so, it has detrimental effects on co-creation and co-innovation particularly when the goals are related to emotional cognitive, material support and relationship building. This study, therefore, targets to scrutinize the dark side of B2B sharing economy platforms using the ethical theory of organizing. The unique contribution of this study is first, showcasing the relationships between ethical climate, ethical practices and consequences. Second, it highlights that B2B alliances that perceive strictness in ethics audits have a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. However, the effect of strictness in ethics training does not lead to the development of a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. This is an interesting finding and generates a theoretical debate. The findings of the study will promote the development of an ethical model that addresses the negative aspects of the B2B sharing economy.",B2B; Sharing economy platform; Value co-creation; Co-innovation; Ethics training; Ethics audit,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-artificial intelligence

Automating the B2B Salesperson Pricing Decision A Human-Machine Hybrid Approach,"Karlinsky-Shichor, Y; Netzer, O",2024,10.1287/mksc.2023.1449,"We propose a human-machine hybrid approach to automating decision making in high human-interaction environments and apply it in the business-to-business (B2B) retail context. Using sales transactions data from a B2B aluminum retailer, we create an automated version of each salesperson, which learns and automatically reapplies the salesperson's pricing policy. In a field experiment with the B2B retailer, we provide salespeople with their own model's price recommendations in real time. We find that, despite the loss of private salesperson information, reducing intertemporal behavioral biases by providing the model's price to the salesperson increases profits for treated quotes by 11% relative to a control condition. Using counterfactual analyses, we show that although the model's pricing leads to higher profitability in most cases, salespeople generate higher profits when pricing out-of-the-ordinary or complex quotes. Accordingly, we propose a machine learning hybrid pricing strategy with two levels of automation. First, a random forest model automatically allocates quotes to either the model or the salesperson based on its prediction of whose pricing would generate higher profits. Then, if the quote is allocated to the model, the model determines the price. The hybrid strategy generates profits significantly higher than either the model or the salespeople.",automation; salesforce; pricing; business to business (B2B); field experiment,INFORMS,wos-automation

We develop and empirically test a novel conceptualization of conversational robo advisors building on prior work in human-to-human communication and interpersonal psychology, showing that conversational robo advisors cause greater levels of affective trust compared to non-conversational robo advisors and evoke a more benevolent evaluation of a financial services firm. We demonstrate that this increase in affective trust not only affects firm perception (in terms of benevolence attributions or a more positively-valenced onboarding experience), but has important implications for investor behavior, such as greater recommendation acceptance and an increase in asset allocation toward conversational robo advisors. These findings have important implications for research on trust formation between humans and machines, the effective design of conversational robo advisors, and public policy in the digital economy.",Robo advisors; Chatbots; Consumer financial decision making; Investment automation; Machine intelligence; Trust,SPRINGER,wos-automation
Optimizing Service Productivity,"Rust, RT; Huang, MH",2012,10.1509/jm.10.0441,"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.",service productivity; financial impact; marketing metrics; self-service; customer satisfaction; service quality; technology,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-automation
Offshore outsourcing of customer relationship management: conceptual model and propositions,"Kalaignanam, K; Varadarajan, R",2012,10.1007/s11747-011-0291-0,"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers. Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems, and other issues.",Offshore outsourcing; Cross-border outsourcing; Offshoring; Customer relationship management; Global marketing; International marketing,SPRINGER,wos-automation
Drivers leading firm adoption of internet banking services,"Claro, DP; Rosa, RB",2016,10.1108/MIP-11-2015-0226,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify factors influencing firm adoption of internet banking services (IBS). While previous literature has primarily focussed on the individual consumers' adoption, the authors aim to shed light on the adoption of online banking by firms. The authors investigate the propensity and speed of IBS adoption and offer recommendations to providers of IBS and firm users. Design/methodology/approach - To attain the above purpose a conceptual model was based on research about IBS adoption in the firm context that derives primarily from technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovation. The authors use data from 5,002 firms located in 239 counties, encompassing 52.1 percent of firms users of IBS of a financial service provider and 47.9 percent of non-user firms. All sampled firms received an offer to adopt IBS from the financial service provider. Such unique data set was analyzed using logistic regression to assess propensity and a survival analysis model to assess IBS adoption speed. Findings - Results revealed that firms, with high propensity to adopt IBS, operate with a diverse management board, are large and young, and compete with a large number of firm users. The survival model showed that the diverse composition of management board also speeds up IBS adoption. Practical implications - Several implications are drawn from the findings. For instance, managers in firms adopting IBS should invest in recruiting and retaining a diverse set of board members (e. g. internal and external with full decision power), which allows for thorough assessment of pros and cons of any relevant decision to be made. The authors also highlight implications for managers in financial service providers (e. g. bank) that offer IBS to automate the relationship with customer firms. Managers should consider the study as a template for the selection criteria of firms that are likely to accept the IBS offer. Originality/value - This is one of few empirical studies to investigate the adoption of IBS in a firm context. Previous studies focussed on the individual consumer adoption of IBS. The authors show that adopting diverse set of board management, growing in size, young firms and facing the competitive environment positively influence firm's propensity to adopt IBS. The authors also analyze the time spent by firms from the IBS offering to the adoption, which shows that management decision context play a key role in adoption speed. The research contributions add to the scarce ongoing discussion about firm's adoption of IBS.",B2B relationship; Firm technology adoption; Internet banking service; Relationship automation,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-automation
Modeling the consumer journey for membership services,"George, M; Wakefield, KL",2018,10.1108/JSM-03-2017-0071,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to model the consumer journey of admission-based membership services from initial purchase to full-season memberships. Particularly, the study pays attention to customer-owned contacts (purchase behavior) and service-owned contacts (salesperson voice- and text-based communications), to examine longitudinal internal data to determine factors which hinder and propel customers toward full memberships. Design/methodology/approach On the basis of big data supplied by a National Hockey League team, the study uses three simultaneous equations in modeling to account for potential endogeneity related to the likelihood that sales and service personnel are more likely to contact frequent customers. The longitudinal data allow us to map the customer journey over the course of multiple years, compared to typical cross-section studies. Findings The findings show that as customers increasingly own committed points of contact, they are prepared to move to the next level - but rarely skip major steps in the relationship journey. The quantity, type and timing of customer contacts by the service firm may hinder or propel the customer down the path to purchase full memberships. Research limitations/implications The prevalence of big data among service firms should allow researchers to better understand how consumers respond to contact strategies over time, as well as fluctuations in firm performance. The research adds to the customer journey research stream, while meeting the call of researchers to bridge the gap between service marketing research priorities and current practice. Practical implications Sales practices and marketing automation tactics may come at the cost of burning leads and alienating future members. Frequent text-based contacts absent voice-based interactions hinder consumer journey and work against relationship building. Service marketers can learn how to better allocate resources, properly manage and motivate contact strategies and target campaigns to send the right message via the right media at the right time. Originality/value This is the first study to map customer journey for admission-based, membership services.

Evaluating and selecting e-commerce software and communication systems for a supply chain,"Sarkis, J; Talluri, S",2004,10.1016/j.ejor.2003.08.018,"The concept of justification and evaluation of systems, projects, and technologies has traditionally fallen within the scope of internal enterprise decision-making. Yet, with the growth of inter-organizational projects, technologies, and programs, the evaluation process takes on a broader and more complex characteristic. Previously, strategic justification and selection focused on internal departments within an organization and meeting their requirements. Within this context the decision was usually tied to strategic goals and directions of the firm, a common element for all departments. Even though the objectives and directions may have some minor conflicts among these various groups, the decision ultimately came down to one decision maker or group that had the best interests of that specific organization in mind. With inter-organizational systems, such as information systems used in managing the supply chain, the conflicts are between organizations that may have more than one supply chain that they are a part of, with varying strategic directions. The additional complexities of multiorganizational systems evaluation are evaluated within a framework described in this paper. The paper's goal is to introduce the various factors and present a decision framework that will aid members of the supply chain and a supply chain director in deciding which electronic commerce technology media and software is most suitable for the whole supply chain. The techniques used in this approach include both qualitative and quantitative measurements for the evaluation or justification of these systems.

Findings - The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications - This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring.

Modelling of consumer challenges and marketing strategies during crisis,"Ishrat, I; Hasan, M; Farooq, A; Khan, FM",2023,10.1108/QMR-12-2021-0149,"PurposeMarketing is all about understanding your consumers and giving them what they want. However, this process becomes more complicated in times of economic crisis and national slowdown. Consumers can become scattered and unpredictable in their behaviour, making it hard to understand what they want or need. At times like these, it is more important than ever to rely on qualitative market research to understand the views of consumers and managers. Thus, this study aims to look at the significant consumer challenges that arise during times of crisis and the marketing strategies that managers prefer to counter the crisis. Design/methodology/approachThe data collected for this study involves an extensive literature review followed by personal interviews with industry experts. This study presents two separate models, indicating hierarchical relationships among consumer challenges during crisis and marketing strategies using the total interpretive structural modelling approach. Further MICMAC analysis (popularly known as cross-impact matrix multiplication) was also performed to assess each variable's driving and dependence power. FindingsPrice sensitiveness and adaptive buying result as driving factors with the highest driving and lowest dependence power, which further gives rise to other consumer behaviour challenges. Likewise, the most critical strategies are information systems and the formation of crisis management teams during a crisis. At the same time, other strategies have resulted as linkage and dependent factors and none as the autonomous factor.

Drivers of autonomous vehicles-analyzing consumer preferences for self-driving car brand extensions,"Eggers, F; Eggers, F",2022,10.1007/s11002-021-09571-x,"Autonomous cars are considered to be the next disruptive innovation that will affect consumers. It can be expected that not only traditional automakers will enter this market (e.g., Ford) but also technology companies (e.g., Google) and newer companies dedicated to self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla). We take a brand extension perspective and analyze to what extent consumers prefer autonomous cars from these brand categories. Our empirical study is based on discrete choice experiments about adopting autonomous vehicles in a purchase scenario and in a renting context. Our findings show that brands play a central role when making autonomous driving decisions. Brand preferences differ systematically when buying versus renting a self-driving car. While technology brands are most preferred overall, consumers favor automaker brands over new brands only when purchasing, not when renting. We further disentangle the brand strength into the marginal effects of image associations. For example, Google's strong brand positioning can be explained by experiences with the parent brand, but it could still improve brand strength by highlighting the relevance of the associated brand portfolio for self-driving cars. The effect of these brand extension success factors differs between parent-brand categories and also between the renting and purchasing scenarios, which requires a dedicated brand management.",Autonomous cars; Brand extension; Brand image; Innovations; Conjoint analysis,SPRINGER,wos-autonomous
The transformative potential of marketing from the consumers' point of view,"Heath, TP; Chatzidakis, A",2012,10.1002/cb.1387,"In this article, we explore consumers' perceptions of marketing and the extent to which they believe that marketing can play a positive transformative role in society. Findings from 36 semistructured interviews indicate that consumers typically perceive marketing as having a traditional short-term, transactional, and company-focused orientation rather than a transformative one. This was reflected in participants' views of marketing, as well as in their choices and comments when they were given two academic definitions of marketing and one description of unethical marketing and asked to choose the one they thought best described marketing. In addition, participants viewed marketing as manipulative, and most held one-sidedly negative opinions of its transformative potential. The majority did not feel autonomous in their purchase decisions, calling into question marketers' usual defence that consumers are sovereign. In a similar vein, they expressed concerns about the effects of marketing's manipulative and deceptive techniques on vulnerable consumers. These findings are rather worrying given that enhancing the transformative potential of marketing requires a more nuanced understanding of its role and function within society. Accordingly, we argue that successful transformative marketing interventions need to take into account and address consumers' disbelief as to the capacity of marketing to improve social welfare.

Are regional political decisions the key element in reducing seasonal variation in tourism? The case of the Balearic Islands,"Sastre, MAG; Hormaeche, MA; Villar, MT",2015,10.5367/te.2015.0519,"As a mature tourism destination, the Balearic Islands suffer the normal effects of the stagnation stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC) model. During stagnation, reorientation policies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of those effects in order to reduce the prevalence of seasonality. Various planning instruments have been designed and implemented by successive local governments, a key priority being the attempt to find a strategic answer to reducing this phenomenon. Based on the analysis of successive marketing plans of the Autonomous Region of the Balearic Islands, and using the Gini index to measure seasonality, this study explores the link between the two and demonstrates that regional political policies adopted over the last 20 years have not reduced seasonal variation in tourism. The demand remains at the same levels of seasonality as in the 1990s, suggesting the ineffectiveness of the policies implemented.",seasonality; marketing plan; tourism destination; Balearic Islands,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,wos-autonomous
Customer Integration-A Key to an Implementation Perspective of Service Provision,"Moeller, S",2008,10.1177/1094670508324677,"A paradigm shift in marketing seems to be underway. Inspired by Vargo and Lusch's (2004a) proposal of service dominant logic, customer integration is proposed as a key component of marketing. Three stages of service provision are identified: facilities, transformation. and usage. The stages differ in terms of resource origin (company or customer), autonomy of decision-making (integrative or autonomous), and value (potential value, value-in-transformation. and value-in-use). These perspectives, which are synthesized in the study framework, shed light on the process of service provision and direct or indirect knowledge application (Vargo and Lusch 2004a). The author aims to show that in the context of the proposed framework, customer integration is vital to the implementation of service provision.",customer integration; service dominant logic; marketing implementation; service provision,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-autonomous

This trend has gained relevance in recent years due to new marketing and distribution processes. Consumers are an increasingly demanding and autonomous market that seeks information, speed and online availability throughout the decision-making process and enjoyment of the trip. Beside, businesses and destinations are committed to strategic lines of online marketing with the aim of expanding the target market, automating processes and streamlining and facilitating the purchase. Moreover, Covid-19 has necessarily accelerated this digitalisation process and users are increasingly using online platforms for their trips. Within this commercial process of digitalisation, tourism service providers must focus on security in order to guarantee a good and quality service. Through a case study and a cluster analysis of travel agencies in Extremadura, as a rural destination, an approach to the web security of the main travel agencies, management groups and commercial groups is carried out. The main objective is to evaluate the real capacity of rural destination marketing through online platforms taking into account web security for users.

Futurizing smart service: implications for service researchers and managers,"Wünderlich, NV; Heinonen, K; Ostrom, AL; Patricio, L; Sousa, R; Voss, C; Lemmink, JGAM",2015,10.1108/JSM-01-2015-0040,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to craft a future research agenda to advance smart service research and practice. Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach - This article is based on discussions in the workshop on Fresh perspectives on technology in service at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings - We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value - Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored.

A Negotiation Model for Inducing Higher Service in a Distribution Channel,"Ernst, R; López-Sánchez, JI; Urbano, D",2009,10.1007/s10726-008-9139-5,"This paper analyzes, in the context of negotiation, the problem of coordination and conflict resolution between the manufacturer (Seller) and the retailers (Buyers) for a two-tier inventory system. The retailers capture demand (from customers) and therefore are responsible for the level of service offered by the system. The larger the inventory that a retailer has of a particular product, the lower the probability of running out of stock and therefore, avoid the possibility of a lost sale for the manufacturer. A conflict arises (and therefore the negotiation process starts) when the manufacturer wants the retailer to increase the level of service while retailers are satisfied with the status quo. Using the Nash bargaining solution, we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates behavioral dimensions and predicts the outcome of sharing the profit. The results indicate the advantage of developing long term relationships among the members of the distribution channel to minimize the uncertainty and therefore the source of conflict.",Negotiation; Marketing; Game theory; Operations; Collaborative seller-buyers,SPRINGER,wos-autonomous

Eco-Innovations in Global Markets: The Effect of Ecological (In)Congruence on Consumers' Adoption Intentions,"Tran, TTH; Paparoidamis, NG",2020,10.1177/1069031X20920869,"Eco-innovations are increasingly manufactured and consumed across national borders. Although global outsourcing can be financially profitable, it is questionable whether consumers respond to eco-innovations manufactured in different countries in the same way. This article introduces the ecological country-of-manufacture (COM) concept, which reflects consumers' perception of a country's commitment to sustainable development policy and practices. Drawing on schema theory, the current research examines how consumer reactions to ecological (in)congruence-when the sustainability reputation of a COM is a (mis)match with product eco-friendliness levels-vary across product categories (Study 1a), consumption contexts (Study 1b), and national settings (Study 2). Consumers report more preferential evaluations when there is ecological incongruence for privately consumed products and ecological congruence for publicly consumed products. The results also demonstrate the differential moderating effects of socioeconomic development factors and cultural dimensions. In emerging markets with highly embedded, hierarchical, and high-harmony cultures, consumers require ecological congruence to justify their adoption decisions, whereas in developed markets with highly autonomous, egalitarian, and high-mastery cultures, consumers are more likely to adopt eco-innovations that are ecologically incongruent.",adoption intentions; country of manufacture; eco-innovations; product eco-friendliness,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-autonomous
Mobile advertising adoption by multinationals - Senior executives' initial responses,"Okazaki, S",2005,10.1108/10662240510590342,"Purpose - Although the wireless internet attracts more and more interest from marketers and researchers, there is little empirical evidence of multinational corporations' (MNCs) adoption of pull-type mobile advertising in global markets. The aim of this study is to fill this research gap, by conducting an empirical survey of the perceptions of MNCs operating in Europe regarding SMS-based mobile advertising adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The study proposes six basic constructs which are thought to influence MNCs' decision-making process on mobile advertising adoption. On this base, a structured questionnaire is developed. The data are obtained by telephone interviews from 53 senior executives of MNCs' subsidiaries in Spain. Findings - Hierarchical regression analysis reveals that branding strategy, facilitating conditions, and security and costs are the strongest determinants of MNCs' mobile advertising adoption. Furthermore, discriminant analysis indicates that Japanese, American, and European firms are statistically classifiable according to their cultural affiliation in terms of their perceptions of mobile advertising adoption. Japanese firms are the least willing to use mobile advertising, while their American counterparts are the most motivated in this regard. Originality/value - While SMS-based mobile marketing has been receiving an increasing attention from both academics and practitioners, there exists little empirical research on this area. In this vein, this study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, the study proposes a conceptual research model based on six basic constructs, which incorporate both theoretical and practical perspectives. Second, the model is tested by empirical data obtained from top managers of MNCs' subsidiaries operating in a European market.

How autonomy makes an experience pleasurable: The roles of risk perception and personal control,"Lunardo, R; Saintives, C",2020,10.1177/2051570719828674,"This research challenges the notion that autonomy is beneficial for consumers in every situation. Specifically, this research demonstrates across two experiments and one field study that autonomy can lead to pleasure only when risk is low. Importantly, these studies also identify personal control as a mechanism that explains why autonomy makes the consumption experience more or less pleasurable, depending on risk perceptions. In Study 1, we demonstrate that perceived risk moderates the effect that autonomy may have on making the experience pleasurable, with a lack of risk making autonomy increase personal control. Study 2 replicates this moderating effect of risk in a field study. To test if the effects replicate using another type of perceived risk, Study 3 manipulates social risk and replicates its moderating effect on the relationship between autonomy and personal control on the pleasure observed in Studies 1 and 2. Collectively, this research draws attention to the need to consider risk when making consumers autonomous, and it offers novel contributions to the work on consumer autonomy.",autonomy; personal control; pleasure; risk,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-autonomous

If hotel management is thus unable to properly manage its responses to users' comments in a congruent way, posts related to the ambience dimension become more important. Furthermore, congruence between a published post and the subsequent management response to user comments effectively leads to higher engagement, functional brand image, hedonic brand image and booking intention than incongruent or no management response.",Management response; content type; social media; hotel; congruence; hotel experience,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-autonomous

For the data mining process and the development of customer segments, the authors selected RapidMiner Studio software and used CRISP-DM data mining methodology. Three types of activities were tested to evaluate the economic benefit of created segmentation model on overall 11321 customers. All customers were segmented into two groups based on the created predictive model - one group contained customers that were predicted to become an inactive and second group with customers that were not predicted to become inactive. All customers were split into three groups containing a similar split of predicted outcome. Three different types of activities were performed with all three groups. As a result, common characteristics of segmentation and predictive modelling were identified. The results of the empirical study show that it is possible to create customer segments by using sophisticated predictive model. This can be achieved without having to write statistical software codes. The study results also show that the organization can benefit from the implementation of segmentation based on data mining and predictive modelling in key business areas. Segmentation model created during research show economic benefit for the company. Authors also indicate that this segmentation approach can be replicated in different business areas.",segmentation; Big Data; predictive modelling; decision tree; RapidMiner,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MIA",wos-big data

Drivers of Big Data Analytics’ Adoption and Implications of Management Decision-Making on Big Data Adoption and Firms’ Financial and Nonfinancial Performance: Evidence From Nigeria's Manufacturing and Service Industries,"Egwuonwu, A; Mendy, J; Smart-Oruh, E; Egwuonwu, A",2023,10.1109/TEM.2023.3321426,"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms' financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria's. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig. 1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management's post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study's findings were used to develop Fig. 2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management's support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study's hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE's critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management's decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations' FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context.

Analyzing Bank Overdraft Fees with Big Data,"Liu, X; Montgomery, A; Srinivasan, K",2018,10.1287/mksc.2018.1106,"In 2012, consumers paid $32 billion in overdraft fees, representing the single largest source of revenue for banks fromdemand deposit accounts during this period. Owing to consumer attrition caused by overdraft fees and potential government regulations to reform these fees, financial institutions have become motivated to investigate their overdraft fee structures. Banks need to balance the revenue generated from overdraft fees with consumer dissatisfaction and potential churn caused by these fees. However, no empirical research has been conducted to explain consumer responses to overdraft fees or to evaluate alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees. In this research, we propose a dynamic structural model with consumer monitoring costs and dissatisfaction associated with overdraft fees. We apply the model to an enterprise-level data set of more than 500,000 accounts with a history of 450 days, providing a total of 200 million transactions. We find that consumers heavily discount the future and potentially overdraw because of impulsive spending. However, we also find that highmonitoring costs hinder consumers' effort to track their balance accurately; consequently, consumers may overdraw because of rational inattention. The large data set is necessary because of the infrequent nature of overdrafts; however, it also engenders computational challenges, which we address by using parallel computing techniques. Our policy simulations show that alternative pricing strategies may increase bank revenue and improve consumer welfare. Fixed bill schedules and overdraft waiver programs may also enhance social welfare. This paper explains consumer responses to overdraft fees and evaluates alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees.",banking; overdraft fees; dynamic programming; big data,INFORMS,wos-big data
An empirical case study on Indian consumers' sentiment towards electric vehicles: A big data analytics approach,"Jena, R",2020,10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.12.012,"Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study.

Hacking marketing: how do firms develop marketers' expertise and practices in a digital era?,"Hafezieh, N; Pollock, N; Ryan, A",2023,10.1108/JEIM-12-2021-0530,"PurposeDigital technologies, digitalised consumers and the torrent of customer data have been transforming marketing practice. In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper.Design/methodology/approachThis paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts.FindingsDrawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a 'hacking marketing' approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries.Practical implicationsThis study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study's results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm.",Digitalised consumers; Practice; Expertise; Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Occupations; Hacking,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-big data
Marketing ecosystem: An outside-in view for sustainable advantage,"Zhang, JZ; Watson, GF",2020,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.04.023,"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the outside-in perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities.

Previous research has paid attention to exploring the influence of marketing analytics on business performance, and rarely examined how the use of marketing analytics influences customer agility and satisfaction. According to the dynamic capabilities view and using previous studies, we developed a conceptual framework to explore the effect of marketing analytics use on customer agility and customer satisfaction. In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a threewave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction. The findings suggest that researchers should look beyond direct effects of marketing analytics use and shift their attention on how a marketing analytics can be leveraged to enable and support dynamic capabilities and customer satisfaction.",Marketing analytics use; Customer agility; Customer satisfaction; Data-driven culture; Market turbulence,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,wos-big data
What can we learn from marketers? A bibliometric analysis of the marketing literature on business model research,"Maucuer, R; Renaud, A; Ronteau, S; Muzellec, L",2022,10.1016/j.lrp.2022.102219,"Strategic management has extensively contributed to the development of business model research. Although marketing concepts (e.g., customers, value creation, delivery, and exchange) form an essential part of any business model description, from an academic standpoint, the strategy literature has been slow to incorporate contributions from the marketing literature on business model research. Drawing on mixed bibliometric techniques combining co-citation analysis (CCA) and bibliographic coupling analysis (BCA), we seek to fill this gap by exploring the origins and trends of business model research in marketing journals (285 articles published in 38 marketing journals). The CCA reveals three theoretical pillars labelled 'business model rationale in marketing', 'business model conceptual origins', and 'business model literature de-velopments' that provide a consistent base for cross-fertilization. The BCA uncovers eight con-versations organized into two research streams, namely 'holistic perspective' and 'downstream perspective'. Considering these results, we discuss the partial appropriation of marketing issues by strategists and propose a three-pronged research agenda based on consumer data as a major source of competitive advantage.",Business model research; Marketing discipline; Downstream; Demand-side; Customer-centric; Bibliometrics,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,wos-big data
Big Data as a Governance Mechanism,"Zhu, C",2019,10.1093/rfs/hhy081,"This study empirically investigates two effects of alternative data availability: stock price informativeness and its disciplining effect on managers' actions. Recent computing advancements have enabled technology companies to collect real-time, granular indicators of fundamentals to sell to investment professionals. These data include consumer transactions and satellite images. The introduction of these data increases price informativeness through decreased information acquisition costs, particularly in firms in which sophisticated investors have higher incentives to uncover information. I document two effects on managers. First, managers reduce their opportunistic trading. Second, investment efficiency increases, consistent with price informativeness improving managers' incentives to invest and divest efficiently.

Optimal rebate strategy for an online retailer with a cashback platform: commission-driven or marketing-based?,"Mu, LF; Tang, X; Sugumaran, V; Xu, W; Sun, XY",2023,10.1007/s10660-021-09485-w,"This paper analyzes an emerging rebate mode where a cashback website not only serves as a promotional device in generating more sales for an online retailer, but also makes decisions on its marketing effort autonomously under certain product availability conditions set by the online retailer. Using a game-theoretic approach, this paper analyzes the optimal decision of both parties in commission-driven rebate mode and marketing-based rebate mode in a market dominated by the online retailer and cashback website respectively. Our main findings are as follows: (1) In the Retailer Stackelberg (RS) game, which rebate mode an online retailer will adopt is related to the marketing cost of the rebate channel and the consumer utility discount (UD) factor. (2) Both rebate modes will help the retailer to expand the market and increase profit because of price differentiation. (3) There is a possible price trap in marketing-based rebate mode. (4) In RS game, the effect of consumer UD factor on the optimal marketing effort is related to the product availability in the rebate channel. (5) In both RS game and Cashback-website Stackelberg (CS) game, the online retailer should strive to become a leader. However, the cashback website prefers the online retailer to be a leader when marketing cost is relatively low in the marketing-based mode. Our results, consistent with several real-world observations, have useful implications for marketers.",Electronic commerce; Dual channel; Cashback website; Rebate strategy; Pricing strategy,SPRINGER,wos-big data
Executive decision-making in fashion retail: a phenomenological exploration of resources and strategies,"Testa, DS; Karpova, EE",2022,10.1108/JFMM-08-2020-0169,"Purpose Decision-makers must be well-informed to successfully impact the future of the business. The purpose of this study was to explore experiences of US fashion retail executives when making business decisions to understand what resources and strategies are utilized within the decision-making process. Additionally, the role of academic research within executive decision-making process was explored. Design/methodology/approach This study utilized a phenomenological approach to understand the experiences of fashion retail executives when engaging in business decision-making. Fifteen US fashion retail executives participated in the study. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews and thematically coded to gain a holistic perspective of the decision-making process within the fashion retail industry. Findings As the result of the data analysis and interpretation, three topical areas emerged:: Incredible Amounts of Information, Industry Specific Academic Research and Have a Clear Road Map. The findings suggested that while the facts gleaned from internal and external data are of great importance to fashion professionals, insights gathered from social media are equally influential within the decision-making process. The authors identified five major strategies utilized consistently by fashion retail executives regardless of the type of business they represented: collaboration, adaptability, speed, gut instinct and creativity. Research limitations/implications The results are important to fashion retail companies for improving internal decision-making processes.

Digitalization in B2B marketing: omnichannel management from a PLS-SEM approach,"Alonso-Garcia, J; Pablo-Marti, F; Núñez-Barriopedro, E; Cuesta-Valiño, P",2023,10.1108/JBIM-09-2021-0421,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish a reference model that will allow us to understand the factors that influence the omnichannel management of an organization in a business-to-business (B2B) context. Design/methodology/approach In building the model, a partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was followed. More than 1,000 executives with a C-level profile (chief executive officer, chief marketing officer or chief digital officer), from manufacturers and wholesalers, in various industries worldwide were contacted. The final sample consisted of 124 C-level executives in multinational B2B companies from 35 countries worldwide. Findings The principal finding is that optimal omnichannel management must involve a customer-centric proposition forming the basis for individualized marketing that tailors the company's portfolio of solutions to suit each client. To ensure this, customer knowledge at each touchpoint is essential. The results show that the main predictor of B2B omnichannel management is sales and marketing, even above channels. The principal conclusions are that the model shows that good omnichannel performance is measured by the performance of the industrial buyer. Loyalty and experience are primary measures of this customer's performance.

Big data and talent management: Using hard data to make the soft stuff easy,"Russell, C; Bennett, N",2015,10.1016/j.bushor.2014.08.001,"Our increasing capacity to collect, store, and analyze large volumes of data has changed the way in which organizational decision makers approach their work. The ability to accurately quantify variables that previously had been assigned to the gut instinct of grizzled veterans or subject to the wisdom of sages for interpretation can now be more objectively understood. The implications for organizational performance are clear: better data and better decisions yield better performance. In many functions, like marketing, this capability has resulted in a true revolution in how companies come to understand and most profitably serve customers. Other areas, such as talent management, have lagged behind in this regard. This is largely due to the fact that many of the relevant variables (e.g., personality) are difficult to measure. It is also because the relationship between these variables and organizational performance is not entirely understood. Recent developments regarding how we understand and then link individual characteristics and performance are enabling a data revolution in the area of talent management. Herein, we offer three examples that illustrate how data can now be used to improve talent management decisions and, ultimately, organizational performance.

Determinants of Subscription Renewal Behavior in Sport Spectatorship Services: A CHAID Decision Tree Modeling Approach,"Chang, Y; Warren, C; Katz, M",2023,10.32731/SMQ.322.062023.03,"Attempts were made to identify the prioritized determinants of season ticket holders' (STHs) renewal behavior. Also, grounded in the lens of luxury fever, we explored how the determinants are differently weighed and processed across two types of STHs, including regular (R-STHs) vs. premium seat holders (P-STHs). Through a partnership with a Big Ten athletic department, the attendance data were obtained and analyzed. This study adapted a decision tree modeling approach to predict renewal/churning behavior by setting learning decision rules in the CHAID algorithm, a supervised learning algorithm family. Results of this study indicate that discounted tickets, affordability, and entertainment were important determinants for R-STHs. By contrast, tenure as a ticket holder, game outcomes, and business use were significantly weighed for P-STHs.

Classifying the Variety of Customers' Online Engagement for Churn Prediction with a Mixed-Penalty Logistic Regression,"Simovic, PP; Chen, CYT; Sun, EW",2023,10.1007/s10614-022-10275-1,"Using big data to analyze consumer behavior can provide effective decision-making tools for preventing customer attrition (churn) in customer relationship management (CRM). Focusing on a CRM dataset with several different categories of factors that impact customer heterogeneity (i.e., usage of self-care service channels, service duration, and responsiveness to marketing actions), this research provides new predictive analytics of customer churn rate based on a machine learning method that enhances the classification of logistic regression by adding a mixed penalty term. The proposed penalized logistic regression prevents overfitting when dealing with big data and minimizes the loss function when balancing the cost from the median (absolute value) and mean (squared value) regularization. We show the analytical properties of the proposed method and its computational advantage in this research. In addition, we investigate the performance of the proposed method with a CRM dataset (that has a large number of features) under different settings by efficiently eliminating the disturbance of (1) least important features and (2) sensitivity from the minority (churn) class.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was used in this research in which interviews were conducted with top management, comprising the owners/directors and other key managers from small- and medium-sized organisations based in Penang, Malaysia. Fan and Gordon's (2014) categorisation of the social media data analysis process and Simon's (1995) concept of the interactive and diagnostic usage of data were used in the analysis of data. Findings The managers of small- and medium-sized hospitality organisations engage with social media for customer relationship management and the understanding of key main competitors. Social media is used to understand, build and manage relationships with current and potential customers; these activities are also linked to actions taken to protect a company's reputation. Even though, for the companies concerned, data gathering is still at the capture stage with no formal procedures and processes in place, the data are utilised in an interactive way to inform two areas' major business decisions-making, i.e. those related to pricing and promotion and the strategic formulation and reorientation of the business. Research limitations/implications The respondents of this study were mainly from smaller hospitality organisations. Hence, the insights gained are limited to the context of smaller hotels.

Estimating Promotion Effects Using Big Data: A Partially Profiled LASSO Model with Endogeneity Correction*,"Sun, LP; Zheng, XN; Jin, Y; Jiang, MH; Wang, HS",2019,10.1111/deci.12354,"Retailers are interested in understanding which price promotions are profitable and which are not. However, simultaneously estimating the promotion effects of a large number of products on retailer sales and profits is technically challenging for both researchers and practitioners. To address this challenge, this study proposes a Partially Profiled Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Partially Profiled LASSO) model, which can estimate ultra-high-dimensional regression relationships at a low computational cost and control for the endogeneity of promotion depth. The model can flexibly incorporate the time-varying promotion effects and the cross-over effects among the promotions of different products. We conduct an empirical study using data provided by a large retailer over a 5-month period. Our model efficiently identifies products with promotion effects and the promotion effects are significantly associated with certain promotion, product, and category characteristics. The results also show that our model with cross-over effects outperforms the benchmark models that are widely used to handle the high-dimensional predictor matrix (e.g., the standard LASSO and principal component regression methods).

Design/methodology/approach The oxygenation signals extracted from the purchase trials of each subject were temporally averaged to obtain average signals for buy and pass decisions. The obtained data were analyzed via both linear mixed models for each of the 16 optodes to explore their separate role in the purchasing decision process and a discriminant analysis to construct a classifier for buy/pass decisions based on oxygenation measures from multiple optodes. Findings Positive purchasing decisions significantly increase the neural activity through fronto-polar regions, which are closely related to OFC and vmPFC that modulate the computation of subjective values. The results showed that neural activations can be used to decode the buy or pass decisions with 85 per cent accuracy provided that sensitivity to the budget constraint is provided as an additional factor. Research limitations/implications The study shows that the fNIRS measures can provide useful biomarkers for improving the classification accuracy of purchasing tendencies and might be used as a main or complementary method together with traditional research methods in marketing. Future studies might focus on real-time purchasing processes in a more ecologically valid setting such as shopping in supermarkets. Originality/value This paper uses an emerging neuroimaging method in consumer neuroscience, namely, fNIRS.

The Value of Field Experiments,"Li, JQ; Rusmevichientong, P; Simester, D; Tsitsiklis, JN; Zoumpoulis, SI",2015,10.1287/mnsc.2014.2066,"The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: the number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments. We also discuss how to evaluate whether field experiments can help optimize other marketing decisions, such as selecting which products to advertise or promote.",field experiments; promotions; big data; sparsity,INFORMS,wos-big data
Exploring new ways to utilise the market intelligence (MI) function in corporate decisions: Case opinion mining of nuclear power,"Nuortimo, KP; Härkönen, J",2019,10.37380/jisib.v9i1.401,"The challenge in today's corporations is that even though the technology portfolio of a company plays a crucial role in delivering revenue-falling as a topic mainly under the area of technology management-technology may have a negative image due to observed risks or failing the sustainability criteria. It may influence the company's image and brand image, possibly also influencing decisions at corporate level. The monitoring of technology sentiments is therefore emphasized, benefiting from the advanced methods for business environment scanning, namely market and competitor intelligence functions. This paper utilizes a new big data based method, mostly utilized in market(MI)/competitor intelligence(CI) functions of the company, opinion mining, to analyse the global media sentiment of nuclear power and projects deploying the technology. With this approach, it is easier to understand the linkage to corporate images of companies deploying the technology and also related corporate decisions, mainly done in the areas of technology market deployment, marketing and strategic planning. The results indicate how the media sentiment towards nuclear power has been mostly negative globally, particularly in social media. In addition, results from similar analyses from a single company's images for the companies currently deploying the technology are seemingly less negative, indicating the influence of company's communication and branding activities. This paper has implications showing that a technology's media sentiment can influence a company's brand image, marketing communications and the need for actions when technology is deployed. In conclusion, there seems to be a need for better co-operation between different corporate functions, namely technology management, MI, marketing and strategic planning, in order to indicate technology image impacts and also counteract firestorms from social media.",Company media analysis; editorial media; learning machine; market intelligence; media-analysis; nuclear power; opinion mining; social media; web intelligence,"HALMSTAD UNIV, SWEDEN",wos-big data

It is helpful to deepen the understanding of reasoning theory and the process of decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on 31 independent empirical studies (including 11,600 samples) published by predecessors, meta-analysis is used to systematically integrate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance and explore the potential factors affecting their relationship. Findings The results show a positive correlation between two decision-making styles and firm performance and the influence of effectuation decision-making style in firm performance is slightly stronger. However, the application environment is different: in the emerging market, the causation decision-making style is more effective for firm performance management. When the firm chooses the effectuation decision-making style, it is more effective for performance management in the emerging market. In addition, the industry type, firm performance evaluation tools, national development level and firm scale and firm age can significantly moderate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance.

Using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines to Model Complex Consumer Shopping Patterns,"Xia, FH; Chatterjee, R; May, JH",2019,10.1287/mksc.2019.1162,"Marketers have recognized that the probability of a consumer's (or household's) purchase in a particular product category may be influenced by past purchases in the same category and also, purchases in other related categories. Past studies of crosscategory effects have focused on a limited number of product categories, and they have often ignored intertemporal effects in their analyses. Those studies have generally used multivariate logit or probit models, which are limited in their ability to analyze enormous data sets that contain consumer purchase records across a large number of categories and time periods. The availability of such enormous consumer shopping data sets and the value of analyzing the complex relationships across categories and over time (for example, for personalized promotions) suggest the need for computationally efficient modeling and estimation methods. Such models can capture associations among buying decisions across all product categories and over all time periods for which data are available, but they must also have a tractable and clear model structure that permits meaningful interpretation of the results. We explore the nature of intertemporal crossproduct patterns in an enormous consumer purchase data set using a model that adopts the structure of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs). Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach using the efficient estimation algorithm embodied in the CRBM enables us to process very large data sets and capture the consumer decision patterns for both predictive and descriptive purposes that might not otherwise be apparent.

To study the conditions for a co-branding strategy, we develop a two-stage differential game model involving two manufacturers and an online platform to explore the choice of supply chain members, incorporating consumer reference price behavior. Interestingly, a result shows that manufacturers choose to co-brand if the combined impact factor is large and the revenue-sharing factor is medium, and the response of the platform for this choice is positive. Another finding is that although the impact of co-branding on operational decisions and consumers is uncertain, it is found that proper co-branding is a powerful tool for marketing strategies. In addition, the existence of reference price behavior improves operational decisions and influences the choice of a co-branding strategy. Furthermore, the extended model proves that big data marketing effectively expands the range of co-branding strategy selections.",Co-branding; Consumer reference price behavior; Differential game; Co-branding strategy selection,SPRINGER,wos-big data
When 'significant' is not significant,"Kennedy, R; Scriven, J; Nenycz-Thiel, M",2014,10.2501/IJMR-2014-041,"Big data is here for some and coming for many. It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies. We offer insights for market research practitioners and marketers alike, to ensure they are getting the best from their data for robust marketing decision-making.",,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,wos-big data
Seize the Opportunity of Targeted Marketing Under the Platform Membership Mechanism,"Hu, L; Sun, XH; Yu, H; Chung, SH",2024,10.1109/TEM.2022.3169392,"Under the pressure of surging advertising costs and fierce market competition, a growing number of online merchants are trying to implement new advertising strategies to improve advertising efficiency and increase sales. In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.",Advertising; Electronic commerce; Costs; Analytical models; Sun; Pricing; Industries; E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,wos-big data
Exploring the complementary effects of business analytics capabilities and π-shaped skills on innovation outcomes,"Abubakar, AM; Türkmen, A; Isik, V; Mikalef, P; Turel, O",2024,10.1080/0960085X.2024.2304030,"While it is clear that business analytics (BA), on average, adds value to firms, it is less clear why some firms perform better than others in leveraging their data assets. To a large degree, prior research has attributed such differences to the human factor. Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning what impact competencies of key personnel have on generating value from BA initiatives, and to what extent such outcomes complement a firm's investment in BA. To examine these questions, this study explores the complementary relationship between BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills. It posits that the concurrent presence of both indirectly influences innovation outcomes by fostering a data-driven culture. We build on a sample of 185 individuals with supervisory positions in Turkey to unpack this process. The findings revealed that BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills influence a firm's data-driven culture, which in turn impacts the firms' marketing innovation, and subsequently its innovative performance. That is, data-driven culture and firms' marketing innovation are relevant underlying serial mechanisms by which BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills influence innovative performance.",Big data; Business analytics; data-oriented culture; Pi-shaped skills; Innovative performance; Socio-materiality theory,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,wos-big data

Developing firms' growth approaches as a multidimensional decision to enhance key stakeholders' wellbeing,"Kumar, V; Ramachandran, D",2021,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.09.004,"Firms facing a dynamic marketplace associated with the increasing adoption of new-age technology, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of stakeholders seek guidance on the investment of scarce resources across these three primary dimensions. The key questions facing firms are: How can we capitalize on the three primary dimensions (the increasing new-age technology adoption, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of key stakeholders) and overcome their associated challenges to achieve sustainable firm growth? This study aims to revive the thinking based on the growth strategy literature in the current environment, by presenting a 4E growth strategy matrix comprising of entrenching, empowering, enterprising, and enriching growth strategies. We propose that a firm can invest resources to maximize on one, two, or all three primary dimensions to produce the four growth strategies. We present an organizing frame-work based on insights from our triangulated research approach. Each of the growth strategies discussed will result in building certain types of firm capabilities, which will then lead to serving the needs and well-being of the key stakeholders. We also present an extensive research agenda that emerges from the four growth strategies. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In order to do this, the clients are demanding more data, more often. On the other hand, marketing research companies are finding it increasingly difficult to get respondents to participate in quantitative studies.

Concepts like personalization, loyalty programs, and customer valuation are used regularly to interact with and prioritize customers. Unsurprisingly, this more widespread use has changed our understanding of CRM substantially and as a consequence, the field has seen a remarkable transformation in the past 3 decades. Yet, the CRM strategies implemented by many firms today are frequently still fundamentally based on an understanding of CRM from the early days. The purpose of this article is to outline the origins of CRM and to present the main wisdoms that firms believed to be true about customers 3 decades ago. I then discuss the key insights that academics and managers have obtained in recent years that increasingly challenge those wisdoms. The article ends with an outlook of CRM in years to come and presents some of the major challenges practitioners and researchers will have to deal with in the near future.

Mapping potentials and challenges of choice modelling for social science research,"Liebe, U; Meyerhoff, J",2021,10.1016/j.jocm.2021.100270,"This paper argues that choice modelling is a useful approach for all social sciences, while at the same time disciplines such as sociology and political science can contribute significantly to the future development of choice modelling. So far choice modelling has mainly been applied in disciplines that investigate types of consumption choices, be it marketing to investigate preferences for new products, transportation to analyse mode choices, or environmental economics to elicit preferences for public goods. However, using the information that can be gained from individual choices among mutually exclusive alternatives has gained increasing popularity in other disciplines as a powerful tool to test theoretical hypotheses and generate insights into individual behaviour. Examples are the acceptance of refugee shelters in peoples' neighbourhood, the choice of where to commit a crime or the evolution of social networks. A good point of departure for an expansion of choice modelling within the social sciences is the common foundation that many disciplines share that are gathered under the umbrella of social sciences. Research traditions and theoretical models include rational choice concepts, and choice modelling can be linked to crosscutting methods, including agent-based models, network analysis, and machine learning. At the same time, disciplines can complement each other in studying choice behaviour, as they can contribute concepts and tools less familiar to the other disciplines. Finally, all social science disciplines face challenges when it comes to issues such as causal analysis, heterogeneity in decision rules, joint decision making, or big data. Choice modelling and a cross-disciplinary dialogue can contribute to meeting these challenges.",Causal analysis; Context effects; Decision rules; Machine learning; Network analysis; Rational choice; Social sciences,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,wos-big data

S1 was described by D. Kahneman as a spontaneous and automatic reaction by an unconscious way in which human decision-makers choose among multiple alternatives. Application of S1 can be seen as a simplified BWS for data eliciting and express analysis of prioritization between many compared items. In S1, a respondent picks the items with which she feels happy, and those can be one, several, all, or none items in a task. Estimation of utilities is performed by multinomial-logit modeling with different optimization criteria which produce parameters of the models and choice probabilities of the items. Numerical examples by marketing research data are encouraging and demonstrating that spontaneous choice decisions can make S1 approach very fast, efficient, and convenient for express analysis of items prioritization, especially for big data.",System 1; BWS; max diff; MNL utility; choice probability; prioritization,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-big data

We develop a descriptive model of 'locked-in' pricing practice to explain organisational routines focused on cost-plus pricing, alignment with competitor prices and historical pricing. Drivers include the complex and uncertain outcomes of pricing, and lack of investment in leading-edge pricing methodologies, together with inadequate training and pricing ownership. Outcomes comprise an aversion to price risk-taking, sees decisions guided by heuristics and a lack of openness to alternative pricing methods. We offer implications for pricing practice to overcome these locked-in behaviours and suggest that research addresses challenges encountered in the implementation of new pricing techniques in organisational settings to narrow the gap between theory and practice.",Online retail; big data; retail pricing; merchandising; pricing practices,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-big data
P2V-MAP: Mapping Market Structures for Large Retail Assortments,"Gabel, S; Guhl, D; Klapper, D",2019,10.1177/0022243719833631,"The authors propose a new, exploratory approach for analyzing market structures that leverages two recent methodological advances in natural language processing and machine learning. They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant to assortment-related decisions.",market structure analysis; product maps; machine learning; retailing; big data,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-big data
A Good Signal: How Firms Can Utilize Country of Origin as a Strategic Analytical Tool,"Rahman, RU; Heinberg, M; Banerjee, S; Katsikeas, CS",2024,10.1177/1069031X241254038,"Abundant consumer data has made decision-making more complicated, rather than simple, for marketers. This raises an important question about which variables in the data contain reliable information for retailers to predict future consumer purchase value (CPV) to guide strategic decisions. The authors address this question by exploring the variables distinctive choice of brand country of origin (DBCOO) and country of origin diversity (COO diversity) as analytical tools to extract insights from consumer purchase data. Building on signaling theory, the authors theorize and empirically test that DBCOO and COO diversity in a consumer's purchase history can signal, and therefore help predict, CPV. Moreover, the authors explore high-involvement product categories and purchase frequency as boundary conditions to develop a comprehensive framework of COO signals as strategic analytical tools. They find that DBCOO in a consumer's purchase history indeed increases CPV and that this relationship is enhanced for high-involvement product categories but moderated curvilinearly by purchase frequency. Moreover, they find that the COO diversity-CPV link is positive but interacts negatively with both moderators. This allows retailers to successfully distinguish high- from low-CPV consumers and thus enables them to manage the marketing mix and resources more effectively.",country of origin; consumer analytics; consumer purchase value; COO diversity; consumer-based strategy; high-involvement product,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-big data

Incorporating data quality into a multi-product procurement planning under risk,"Shabani-Naeeni, F; Yaghin, RG",2021,10.1108/JBIM-02-2020-0108,"Purpose - In the data-driven era, the quality of the data exchanged between suppliers and buyer can enhance the buyer's ability to appropriately cope with the risks and uncertainties associated with raw material purchasing. This paper aims to address the issue of supplier selection and purchasing planning considering the quality of data by benefiting from suppliers' synergistic effects. Design/methodology/approach - An approach is proposed to measure data visibility's total value using a multi-stage algorithm. A multi-objective mathematical optimization model is then developed to determine the optimal integrated purchasing plan in a multi-product setting under risk. The model contemplates three essential objective functions, i.e. maximizing total data quality and quantity level, minimizing purchasing risks and minimizing total costs. Findings - With emerging competitive areas, in the presence of industry 4.0, internet of things and big data, high data quality can improve the process of supply chain decision-making. This paper supports the managers for the procurement planning of modern organizations under risk and thus provides an in-depth understanding for the enterprises having the readiness for industry 4.0 transformation.

Predictive policing in hospitality and tourism venues - The case of Orlando,"Khalilzadeh, J",2021,10.1016/j.jdmm.2020.100535,"The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed.

How market orientation contributes to innovation and market performance: the roles of business analytics and flexible IT infrastructure,"Ashrafi, A; Ravasan, AZ",2018,10.1108/JBIM-05-2017-0109,"Purpose Market orientation (MO) (intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness) is known as one of the key concepts in marketing literature. Although prior research has widely focused on the meaning and application of MO, few attempts have been made to explore how market-oriented firms lead to innovation and market performance and what factors actually moderate this relationship. To fill this gap, the present study aims to explore the relationship between MO, innovation and market performance. This study also attempts to examine the intervening role of IT infrastructure, business analytics (BA) capabilities and market turbulence in the proposed model. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a questionnaire-based survey was undertaken to test the proposed hypotheses. To verify the proposed theoretical model, partial least squares (PLS)/structured equation modeling (SEM) was performed with 114 valid survey data. Findings Despite prior studies which postulated innovation performance as the final outcome of MO (Han et al., 1998; Song et al., 2015), this study focused on innovation performance as a mediating outcome which finally leads to market performance. The statistical results approve the putative relationship which means managers would be able to realize the paramount role of innovation as an integral part of achieving higher market performance. In addition, no support was found for the relationship between intelligence generation and responsiveness. This finding shows that not all obtained information can help managers in the decision-making process. Originality/value This study aims to enrich literature by developing a conceptual model to test the link between MO, innovation and market performance. The value of this study is to investigate the roles of flexible IT infrastructure, BA capabilities and market turbulence as the potential moderators in the proposed model. The results advance the understanding of the influence of BA capabilities on the link between intelligence dissemination and responsiveness. Findings also show innovation performance as remarkable and deemed valuable capability, leading to higher performance in marketing-related activities, particularly in highly turbulent markets.",Market orientation; Responsiveness; Business analytics capability; Flexible IT infrastructure; Intelligence dissemination; Intelligence generation,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-big data

The real-time data processing based on big data technology (such as NoSQL MongoDB and Apache Kafka) is utilized to handle the vast amount of customer behavior data. Design/methodology/approach In order to extract customer behavior patterns, customers' browsing history and transactional data from digital signage (DS) could be used as the input for decision making. First, the authors developed a DSOS and installed it in different locations, so that customers could have the experience of browsing and buying a product. Second, the real-time data processing system gathered customers' browsing history and transaction data as it occurred. In addition, the authors utilized the association rule to extract useful information from customer behavior, so it may be used by the managers to efficiently enhance the service quality. Findings First, as the number of customers and DS increases, the proposed system was capable of processing a gigantic amount of input data conveniently. Second, the data set showed that as the number of visit and shopping duration increases, the chance of products being purchased also increased.

Dynamic Batch Learning in High-Dimensional Sparse Linear Contextual Bandits,"Ren, ZM; Zhou, ZY",2024,10.1287/mnsc.2023.4895,"We study the problem of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits, where a decision maker, under a given maximum-number-of batch constraint and only able to observe rewards at the end of each batch, can dynamically decide how many individuals to include in the next batch (at the end of the current batch) and what personalized action-selection scheme to adopt within each batch. Such batch constraints are ubiquitous in a variety of practical contexts, including personalized product offerings in marketing and medical treatment selection in clinical trials. We characterize the fundamental learning limit in this problem via a regret lower bound and provide a matching upper bound (up to log factors), thus prescribing an optimal scheme for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first inroad into a theoretical understanding of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits. Notably, even a special case of our result-when no batch constraint is present- yields that the simple exploration-free algorithm using the LASSO estimator already achieves the minimax optimal O similar to( root ffiffiffiffiffififfi ) regret bound (s0 is the sparsity parameter or an s0T upper bound thereof and T is the learning horizon) for standard online learning in high dimensional linear contextual bandits (for the no-margin case), a result that appears unknown in the emerging literature of high-dimensional contextual bandits.",dynamic batch learning; LASSO; high-dimensional statistics; contextual bandits; sparsity,INFORMS,wos-big data
Textual analysis as a method of identifying museum attributes perceived by tourists: An exploratory analysis of Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Spain,"Orea-Giner, A; Guerrero, TV",2020,10.7200/esicm.167.0513.2,"Objective: The identification of museum attributes is essential when analysing the different factors that attract visitors and studying it in order to improve efficiency in museums, as this could affect the use of funds for developing a marketing campaign to attract visitors. This paper offers a literature review that considers museum visits and museum attributes before proposing a methodology. Methodology: The use of big data applied to tourism research is vital, as it allows for the consideration of the opinions of museum visitors. The case study in this paper is the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Madrid, Spain. The method for identifying the attributes consists of a textual analysis of TripAdvisor reviews written in English (2500) and Spanish (2500). The information is captured using WebHarvy and is analysed using Nvivo12. Results: After analysing the thousand words that were used most frequently, the main attributes were detected, as well as whether the perception of these attributes was positive or negative. The museum's location and the building itself were the most highly valued attributes. Other attributes that were valued positively were the peripheral services of the museum, such as its food and beverage services. Limitations: The main limitation is that TripAdvisor is not an entirely reliable source of information, so it will be necessary to obtain more reviews to analyse. Practical implications: The identification of attributes allows for improved decision making, as well as facilitating a better understanding of the museum's visitors' perceptions. Being aware of these aspects enables the modification of the museum's services through proposals for changes and improvements.",Cultural tourism; Textual analysis; Visitor experience; Attributes; Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum,ESCUELA SUPERIOR GESTION COMERCIAL & MARKETING,wos-big data
Doing bad by doing good? Corporate social responsibility fails when controversy arises,"Guo, SJ; Wang, CL; Hwang, S; Jin, F; Zhou, LY",2022,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.07.009,"While the benefits of CSR may offer suppliers a competitive advantage in their customer market, CSR remains a paradox as firms struggle to strike a balance between the financial, social, and environmental interests of stakeholders. Such confliction is greatly intensified for firms whose core business and/or marketing communi-cations contradict the general social and environmental interests of the society. Considering theories and con-cepts borrowed from consumer behavior that appear to have been influential in explaining pertinent B2B buyer purchasing decisions, this paper empirically investigates the contingency conditions underpinning CSR and its communication effect on organizational customer outcomes. Our results, based on panel data from Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) and Compustat database, suggest that on average B2B firms' CSR communications significantly enhance their firm value; however, this value enhancing effect is attenuated when controversies weigh in on firms' industry and/or corporate reputations. Specifically, CSR communications have significantly positive impact on firms in regular settings, but the impact becomes negligible or even negative for firms operating in controversial industries or firms face controversial advertising problems.

WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND THE INFLUENCE OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE: THE CASE OF A DAIRY COMPANY,"Cerchi, ALR; Santos, DFL",2023,,"Purpose of the study: to understand working capital management in a large dairy company in the state of Minas Gerais, based on the behavioral approach to finance. Methodology: the research strategy based on a single case was chosen, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis tools Originality: extending the analysis of behavioral biases in decisions on investments in financial assets to the management of working capital. Main results: it was found that the most liquid accounts are those influenced by more behavioral biases. The biases present in decision-making are also consistent with the conservative profile indicated by the dynamic working capital management model. Theoretical contributions: the theoretical trade-off liquidity and profitability does not occur since a higher level of liquidity can be caused precisely by the greater profitability and cash generation capacity of the company compared to the sector. Managerial contributions: the management of working capital must assume a more strategic condition in companies and attentive to the behavioral biases of managers. As a result of the direct impacts of marketing and production policies on investment in working capital, the analysis of indicators must be aligned with the company's profile.",Dynamic Working Capital Model; Profitability; Liquidity; Dairy Sector,FUNDACAO PEDRO LEOPOLDO,wos-big data

The digital traveller: implications for data ethics and data governance in tourism and hospitality,"Yallop, AC; Gica, OA; Moisescu, OI; Coros, MM; Séraphin, H",2023,10.1108/JCM-12-2020-4278,"Purpose Big data and analytics are being increasingly used by tourism and hospitality organisations (THOs) to provide insights and to inform critical business decisions. Particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty data analytics supports THOs to acquire the knowledge needed to ensure business continuity and the rebuild of tourism and hospitality sectors. Despite being recognised as an important source of value creation, big data and digital technologies raise ethical, privacy and security concerns. This paper aims to suggest a framework for ethical data management in tourism and hospitality designed to facilitate and promote effective data governance practices. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts an organisational and stakeholder perspective through a scoping review of the literature to provide an overview of an under-researched topic and to guide further research in data ethics and data governance. Findings The proposed framework integrates an ethical-based approach which expands beyond mere compliance with privacy and protection laws, to include other critical facets regarding privacy and ethics, an equitable exchange of travellers' data and THOs ability to demonstrate a social license to operate by building trusting relationships with stakeholders. Originality/value This study represents one of the first studies to consider the development of an ethical data framework for THOs, as a platform for further refinements in future conceptual and empirical research of such data governance frameworks. It contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge in data ethics and data governance in tourism and hospitality and other industries and it is also beneficial to practitioners, as organisations may use it as a guide in data governance practices.",Hospitality; Tourism; Data governance; Data ethics; COVID-19; Digital privacy,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-big data
Online dynamic group-buying community analysis based on high frequency time series simulation,"Zhu, Q; Zuo, RX; Liu, S; Zhang, F",2020,10.1007/s10660-019-09380-5,"Group-buying often fails even when there are satisfactory quantities as not enough consumers join in the required time, which can waste seller, purchaser, and platform operator time resources; therefore, the group buying features require further research. Over a 3 weeks period, around 700 million click-stream records from 1,061,770 users from a stable and continuous time series were allocated to groups of 5 min frequency, and a hybrid neural network model developed to simulate group-buying behavior in four experiments, from which it was found that adding to the cart and adding as a favorite were significant group-buying behavior features, and shopping depth was the main demographic feature, but age was not. Compared with previous ambiguous online consumer feature conclusions on gender, the results revealed that the commodity feature was the main determinant for gender feature significance. The college student feature was found to be a pseudo feature, and should connect with other fixed effects such as low income or education level. This paper is the first to construct an online dynamic group-buying community, which is a new type of social network and could provide a new perspective for social commerce research. A big data neural network-based method for examining group-buying community behavior over time is proposed that can offer novel insights to online vendors for the development of targeted marketing campaigns.",BiLSTM; Dynamic group-buying community; Social commerce; Time series,SPRINGER,wos-big data
Driving or driven by others? A dynamic perspective on how data-driven start-ups strategize across different network roles in digitalized business networks,"Mosch, P; Winkler, C; Eggert, CG; Schumann, JH; Obermaier, R; Ulaga, W",2022,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.01.023,"Digitalization transforms how actors conduct activities and exchange resources in business networks. Data-driven start-ups are key actors in this transformation as they are often the first to commercialize novel digital technologies and influence business networks through their strategizing. Extant Industrial Marketing & Purchasing (IMP) literature has investigated roles and strategizing in business networks. However, understanding how datadriven start-ups' specificities impact their roles and strategizing is still at its infancy. Specifically, the authors conceptually show that assumptions on how data-driven start-ups strategize contradict strategizing tenets of prior IMP literature. Therefore, previous knowledge on strategizing needs further differentiation. Addressing this research need, theories-in-use and multiple case study research on 23 data-driven start-ups is conducted to examine (1) in what network roles they operate and (2) how they strategize within and across different network roles. The study extends IMP and data-driven business model research by identifying four network roles (enabler, extender, transformer, orchestrator) and developing a specific classification framework for data-driven start-ups. Furthermore, the study shows that IMP tenets apply in specific network roles only to some extent to data-driven start-ups. Finally, three strategizing trajectories are identified, which provide a dynamic perspective to IMP literature for guiding entrepreneurs on strategizing opportunities.",Digitalization; IMP; Business networks; Data-driven start-ups; Strategizing; Case study research,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-big data
Small-series supply network configuration priorities and challenges in the EU textile and apparel industry,"Harper, S; Pal, R",2022,10.1108/JFMM-07-2021-0173,"Purpose Technology and market pressures are encouraging localized and small-series production in customer-driven industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the supply chain-, product- and process-design factors for small-series production in EU's textile and apparel industry, to understand configuration decisions, priorities and challenges. Design/methodology/approach An interview study was undertaken with ten companies that represent diverse small-series production models and value chain roles. Interview data was analysed to identify supply network configuration characteristics, decision priorities and challenges. Findings Three small-series production models emerged from the analysis, differing with respect to adoption of process postponement and customization. The findings confirm and extend past research regarding diverse decision priorities and product, process, supply chain structure/relationship configurations. Challenges identified relate to planning (priorities) and implementation (configuration). Whereas competence availability and digital technology challenges are common, several difficulties are linked to production model like tensions related to priorities and small volumes, which are not found with customization. Research limitations/implications Future research can make comparisons with other industry and location contexts; adopt dynamic approaches to distinguish between design and reconfiguration processes; and address indicated paradoxical-tensions. Practical implications The study findings can provide guidance for companies regarding identification of priorities and management of (planning/implementation) challenges impacting small-series production in T&A.

This paper employs Stackelberg game theory and mean variance analysis to assess the pricing decision-making process under various scenarios. Furthermore, cost-sharing contracts are introduced to coordinate the GSC.FindingsThe research results suggest that the green level of the product and the profit of the GSC under a centralized scenario are higher than those under a decentralized scenario, while the retail price is lower. Under the decentralized scenario, the green level of product, wholesale price and manufacturer's profit in the R-A scenario are lower than the values in the risk-neutrality scenario, while retailer's profit is higher. In addition, when a cost-sharing contract is utilized for coordination in the GSC, it can lead to Pareto improvement, regardless of whether the manufacturer makes risk-neutrality or R-A decisions.Originality/valueThis research provides a deeper understanding of GSC decision-making and coordination strategy under mixed carbon policy with consideration of R-A from a theoretical perspective and provides decision support for enterprises to choose strategies in practice.",Risk-averse; Mixed carbon policy; Green supply chain; Cost-sharing contract,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-big data
"Exploring embeddedness, centrality, and social influence on backer behavior: the role of backer networks in crowdfunding","Chung, YH; Li, YW; Jia, JM",2021,10.1007/s11747-021-00779-x,"This research examines the influence of backers' social networks on their backing behavior using data from a large social networking site and a reward-based crowdfunding platform. We distinguish the roles of nodes and ties in a backer's social network and assess the combined and differential effects of these two types of social relationship on the backer's pledge decisions. As backers have different motives for engaging in different crowdfunding campaigns, which range from commercially oriented technological innovation to community-based social development, we further examine how these effects differ between technology-oriented campaigns and social-oriented campaigns. We find that node-level factors (e.g., centrality) have a greater influence on technology-oriented campaigns than on social-oriented campaigns, while tie-level factors (e.g., embeddedness) have a stronger impact on social-oriented campaigns. Considering the two forms of embeddedness in tandem, we find that the effects of relational embeddedness on backers' pledge decisions are not only moderated by structural embeddedness but also contingent on campaign type. These results offer important theoretical insights into the drivers of contribution, which should be considered by crowdfunding operators and campaign proponents seeking to stimulate contribution.",Backer behavior; Centrality; Crowdfunding; Embeddedness; Social influence; Social network; Tie strength,SPRINGER,wos-big data
Governing social media: the emergence of hybridised boundary objects,"Arnaboldi, M; Azzone, G; Sidorova, Y",2017,10.1108/AAAJ-07-2015-2132,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the processes whereby organisational actors can seize the opportunities opened up through social media, and the way in which the relative information is managed. This allows these actors to move their occupational boundaries, exploiting the information for performance measurement purposes. The investigation was carried out within an organisational setting, where most occupational dynamics take place. The focus was on the role of artefacts within these occupational dynamics and the analysis drew upon the notion of boundary objects. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on case studies involving two organisations that make use of social media within and across several departments. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with social media managers, department managers, analysts and financial controllers and senior executives. The results of the qualitative analysis of the interviews were completed with secondary sources of information, company reports, communications, public policies, codes of conduct and social media platform analyses. Findings - This paper has implications for accounting studies, showing how marketing and communications managers entering the field of performance management can take the lead in social media management by collecting information from social media, constructing indicators and gaining ground in several decision-making centres. The findings highlight the role of new artefacts and organisational roles, whose purpose is to build a digital community. This process involves crossing the boundaries between internal functions and the inside and outside environment, with a driving phenomenon becoming visible: hybridisation. Faced with this change, reluctant accountants with a traditional mindset are more likely to observe the process at a distance, focusing more on their routine operations based on conventional data. Originality/value - This paper shows that information derived from social media is already a reality that has gained significance through the construction of boundary objects. The paper highlights a driving phenomenon that is emerging in the surge to occupy the organisational terrain for controlling social media: that of hybridisation. The concept of hybridisation is not new in management accounting studies, but in this study can be applied to carrying out a joint analysis on both the boundary objects and their organisational trajectory. In the context of social media accounting, hybridisation is of central importance if both actors and objects are to be effectively positioned at its boundary.",Occupation; Social media; Performance management; Management accounting; Boundary objects; Hybridization,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-big data
Service attributes for sustainable rural tourism from online comments: Tourist satisfaction perspective,"Wu, J; Yang, T",2023,10.1016/j.jdmm.2023.100822,"While there have been many tourism studies exploring business opportunities from online comments, research in the context of sustainable rural tourism is rare. In particular, practitioners involved in rural destinations are usually transformed from farmers who are relatively new to information technology and therefore unable to understand the voices of tourists in a timely and effective manner. Aiming to expand the literature on sustainable rural tourism, this study cuts from tourist satisfaction and proposes a mixed methodology to investigate insights for sustaining rural destinations from online comments. Specifically, the KMeans clustering algorithm is first utilized to discover service attributes that visitors value; then Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), an effective satisfaction analysis tool, is adopted to understand tourist satisfaction; to develop specific sustainable strategies, using an advanced opinion extraction technique this work identified dissatisfaction factors of visitors. 5832 online comments of two adjacent rural destinations (i.e. Hongcun and Xidi) were crawled to validate the proposed methodology. Results show that five service attributes were discovered, including Natural environment, Price, Food, Hospitality, and Culture & heritage; Hongcun's Natural environment and Price require urgent measures, and its Food and Hospitality are at a competitive disadvantage compared to Xidi; detailed factors dissatisfying visitors were identified through opinion extraction technique, based on which specific sustainable strategies are generated for authorities and practitioners. By excavating business opportunities from online reviews via big data analysis and text mining techniques, the proposed methodology advances the academic understanding of promoting rural tourism.",Rural destination; Sustainable tourism; Online comments; Tourist satisfaction; IPA/IPCA; Opinion extraction,ELSEVIER,wos-big data
Effective Implementation of Predictive Sales Analytics,"Habel, J; Alavi, S; Heinitz, N",2023,10.1177/00222437221151039,"Sales managers are unlikely to reap the benefits of implementing predictive analytics applications when salespeople show aversion to or lack understanding of these applications. For managers, it is essential to understand which factors mitigate or exacerbate these challenges. This article investigates these factors by studying the implementation of an application that predicts customer churn. Using 9.7 million transactions from a business-to-business company, the authors develop a predictive model of customer churn, implement it in a field experiment, and study its treatment effects using causal forests. Furthermore, the authors manipulate one specific mitigation strategy proposed by prior literature: the fostering of users' realistic expectations regarding the accuracy of an algorithm. The results show that the effectiveness of the churn prediction application strongly depends on customer characteristics (most importantly the predicted churn probability and prior revenue) and salesperson characteristics (technology perceptions, abilities, and selling orientations). Fostering realistic expectations improves the effectiveness of the churn prediction only under very specific circumstances. Two follow-up stimuli-based experiments conceptually replicate key results of the field study. Therefore, this article helps build theory on predictive sales analytics and provides specific guidance to managers aiming to increase their return on analytics investments.",predictive analytics; customer churn; sales management; personal selling; causal forest,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-big data
The provenance of loyalty card data for urban and retail analytics,"Rains, T; Longley, P",2021,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102650,"The deployment of loyalty card and other consumer data in geographic research brings opportunities to explore and understand patterns of purchasing behaviour in unprecedented detail. However, valid generalisation re-quires thorough evaluation of their potential bias. We argue that, in competitive markets where consumers can choose to shop across competing retailers, loyalty card data from just one of these may not represent a 'complete' view of all purchases, and that this 'completeness' must be controlled for when assessing bias. To this end, we undertake a UK wide analysis of loyalty card data assembled by a major UK grocery retailer and provide guidelines for their effective deployment in the domains of urban and retail analysis. We assess, for the first time, the 'completeness' of circa 500 million customer transactions recorded by a major customer loyalty programme in representing the overall purchasing patterns of circa 16 million consumers across the entire UK, and develop a method by which to do this. Moreover, no operator has complete national store coverage, and so we suggest ways of accommodating this when conducting analysis using loyalty card data. We illustrate the importance of these issues before providing recommendations for the wider use of consumer loyalty card data.",Retail geography; Loyalty card data; Consumer data; Urban analytics; Retail analytics,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,wos-big data

Twitter is a prominent social media platform for sharing experiences, and e-retail firms are rapidly emerging as the preferred shopping destination. This study explores customers' online shopping experience tweets. Customers tweet about their online shopping experience based on moments of truth shaped by encounters across different touchpoints. We aggregate 25,173 such tweets related to six e-retailers tweeted over a 5-year period. Grounded on agency theory, we extract the topics underlying these customer experience tweets using unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. The output reveals five topics which manifest into customer experience tweets related to online shopping-ordering, customer service interaction, entertainment, service outcome failure, and service process failure. Topics extracted are validated through inter-rater agreement with human experts. The study, thus, derives topics from tweets about e-retail customer experience and thereby facilitates prioritization of decision-making pertaining to critical service encounter touchpoints.",online customer experience; topic modeling; e-retail; Twitter; latent Dirichlet allocation; agency theory,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,wos-big data

Exploring destination loyalty: Application of social media analytics in a nature-based tourism setting,"Mirzaalian, F; Halpenny, E",2021,10.1016/j.jdmm.2021.100598,"User-generated content across social media platforms is playing an increasingly important role in tourism. Understanding tourists' experiences and opinions about tourism destinations has led to numerous opportunities to provide tourism providers with greater insights. Identifying sentiments, detecting topics of interest, and exploring loyalty behaviors from user-generated content can provide valuable direction for managerial decisions. This paper presents a novel and inclusive approach that uses different analytical techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to extract sentiments and topics of interest from tourists' conversational data on TripAdvisor from 2002 to 2019. Sentiment analysis revealed that some touristic locations in Jasper National Park are outperforming others in terms of sentiment scores, despite the fact that tourists less frequently reflect on their experiences at these places on social media. Such higher rankings suggest that average sentiment score can be a more informative measure than simple TripAdvisor rankings. This paper also explores destination loyalty statements using a keyword clustering approach. Previous destination loyalty literature was used to develop a keyword list that was applied to search for expressions of loyalty in online reviews. The robustness of loyalty clusters and optimal number of clusters was also assessed prior to final analysis. Four leading loyalty-focused categories of destination offerings were observed: glaciers, waterfalls, lakes and islands, and hiking and trails.

In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer's website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots.

How speaking versus writing to conversational agents shapes consumers' choice and choice satisfaction,"Schindler, D; Maiberger, T; Koschate-Fischer, N; Hoyer, WD",2024,10.1007/s11747-023-00987-7,"The use of conversational agents (e.g., chatbots) to simplify or aid consumers' purchase decisions is on the rise. In designing those conversational agents, a key question for companies is whether and when it is advisable to enable voice-based rather than text-based interactions. Addressing this question, this study finds that matching consumers' communication modality with product type (speaking about hedonic products; writing about utilitarian products) shapes consumers' choice and increases choice satisfaction. Specifically, speaking fosters a feeling-based verbalizing focus, while writing triggers a reason-based focus. When this focus matches consumers' mindset in evaluating the product type, preference fluency increases, thereby enhancing choice satisfaction. Accordingly, the authors provide insights into managing interactions with conversational agents more effectively to aid decision-making processes and increase choice satisfaction. Finally, they show that communication modality can serve as a strategic tool for low-equity brands to better compete with high-equity brands.",Conversational agent; Digital assistant; Chatbot; Speaking; Choice,SPRINGER,wos-chatbot

The results showed that chatbot (vs. human) service in-teractions automatically drew more consumer attention at the subconscious stage (i.e., a larger P2); consumers purposefully allocated more resources to regulate the negative emotions elicited by chatbots at the conscious stage (i.e., a larger LPP); and there was a lower trust in chatbots than in humans. Moreover, under subjective tasks, the differences between chatbots and human agents in emotional experience (as reflected by LPP) and trust were amplified.

Determinants affecting customer intention to use chatbots in the banking sector,"Shaikh, IAK; Khan, S; Faisal, S",2023,10.21511/im.19(4).2023.21,"The study aims to analyze the factors that influence customers' inclination to utilize chatbots in banking services. The paper employed the technology acceptance model and utilized structural equation modeling to examine the factors affecting consumers' willingness to embrace chatbot services. The survey evaluated various determinants, including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, privacy concerns, and customer satisfaction. Data were collected from 250 bank customers in the Bombay region of India through an online survey employing a random sampling method. The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS AMOS. This study identifies the aspects of chatbot technology in the banking sector, such as user interface, content, security, and convenience, that influence customers' decisions to adopt this innovative technology. The results of the analysis revealed path coefficients indicating a significant relationship between information security and perceived usefulness ((3 = 0.286; p = 0.005) and between perceived usefulness and intention to use (beta = 0.489; p < 0.001). Additionally, the path coefficients for design, security, and facilitating conditions were beta = 0.281, beta = 0.193, and beta = 0.136, respectively, all of which held nearly equal significance in the study. The inter -correlations among the variables ranged from 0.346 to 0.854 and were statistically significant.

A Video-Based Automated Recommender (VAR) System for Garments,"Lu, SS; Xiao, L; Ding, M",2016,10.1287/mksc.2016.0984,"In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers' preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper's behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.",retailing; video analysis; collaborative filtering,INFORMS,wos-computer vision
The impact of preprocessing on data mining: An evaluation of classifier sensitivity in direct marketing,"Crone, SF; Lessmann, S; Stahlbock, R",2006,10.1016/j.ejor.2005.07.023,"Corporate data mining faces the challenge of systematic knowledge discovery in large data streams to support managerial decision making. While research in operations research, direct marketing and machine learning focuses on the analysis and design of data mining algorithms, the interaction of data mining with the preceding phase of data preprocessing has not been investigated in detail. This paper investigates the influence of different preprocessing techniques of attribute scaling, sampling, coding of categorical as well as coding of continuous attributes on the classifier performance of decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. The impact of different preprocessing choices is assessed on a real world dataset from direct marketing using a multifactorial analysis of variance on various performance metrics and method parameterisations. Our case-based analysis provides empirical evidence that data preprocessing has a significant impact on predictive accuracy, with certain schemes proving inferior to competitive approaches. In addition, it is found that (1) selected methods prove almost as sensitive to different data representations as to method parameterisations, indicating the potential for increased performance through effective preprocessing; (2) the impact of preprocessing schemes varies by method, indicating different 'best practice' setups to facilitate superior results of a particular method; (3) algorithmic sensitivity towards preprocessing is consequently an important criterion in method evaluation and selection which needs to be considered together with traditional metrics of predictive power and computational efficiency in predictive data mining.

The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance.

Customer segmentation using k-means clustering for developing sustainable marketing strategies,"Gautam, N; Kumar, N",2022,10.17323/2587-814X.2022.1.72.82,"Sales and marketing is the indispensable department of an organization which leads to the generation of revenue and building customer relationship. Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns.

A probability-mapping algorithm for calibrating the posterior probabilities: A direct marketing application,"Coussement, K; Buckinx, W",2011,10.1016/j.ejor.2011.05.027,"Calibration refers to the adjustment of the posterior probabilities output by a classification algorithm towards the true prior probability distribution of the target classes. This adjustment is necessary to account for the difference in prior distributions between the training set and the test set. This article proposes a new calibration method, called the probability-mapping approach. Two types of mapping are proposed: linear and non-linear probability mapping. These new calibration techniques are applied to 9 real-life direct marketing datasets. The newly-proposed techniques are compared with the original, non-calibrated posterior probabilities and the adjusted posterior probabilities obtained using the rescaling algorithm of Saerens et al. (2002). The results recommend that marketing researchers must calibrate the posterior probabilities obtained from the classifier. Moreover, it is shown that using a 'simple' rescaling algorithm is not a first and workable solution, because the results suggest applying the newly-proposed non-linear probability-mapping approach for best calibration performance.

Decision trees do not lie: Curiosities in preferences of Croatian online consumers,"Filipas, AM; Vretenar, N; Prudky, I",2023,10.18045/zbefri.2023.1.157,"Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers' preference indicator.",decision-making; consumers' preferences; data mining; decision trees; shopping behaviour indicators,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",wos-data mining

Further, we investigate the effect of introducing diversity into the population used by our genetic algorithm. We allow the genetic algorithm to simultaneously focus on two distinct probabilistic measures-one that is risk averse and one that is risk seeking.

Chinese Customers' Evaluation of Travel Website Quality: A Decision-Tree Analysis,"Sun, P; Cárdenas, DA; Harrill, R",2016,10.1080/19368623.2015.1037977,"Web design in tourism organizations has become one of the key factors in maintaining a successful travel business. With questions of sustainability plaguing travel agencies, questions on how they should allocate their limited resources for website development to meet changing consumer needs while producing an effective and efficient website linger. This study provides a new technique and tool, decision trees and Weka, that identifies critical attributes that influence quality levels of a customer's experience when visiting a travel agency's website. The exploratory study derived eight evaluation attributes based on the attention, interest, desire, and action model. The study generated decision trees via Weka, a data-mining open-source software platform, to analyze the datasets from a web-based experiment. Results indicate that information quality is the most important attribute in designing the website of a travel agency. Then, attributes that enhance the simplicity of websites, such as ease of use, personalization, and flexible reservations, are considered by the customer when evaluating the website quality. Attractiveness can only contribute to evaluations of a website's quality after usefulness and website simplicity have been determined. Keeping the website useful, simple, and attractivein that orderwill give managers of travel agencies the guidance to design their websites and improve company performance.

Improved customer choice predictions using ensemble methods,"van Wezel, M; Potharst, R",2007,10.1016/j.ejor.2006.05.029,"In this paper various ensemble learning methods from machine learning and statistics are considered and applied to the customer choice modeling problem. The application of ensemble learning usually improves the prediction quality of flexible models like decision trees and thus leads to improved predictions. We give experimental results for two real-life marketing datasets using decision trees, ensemble versions of decision trees and the logistic regression model, which is a standard approach for this problem. The ensemble models are found to improve upon individual decision trees and outperform logistic regression. Next, an additive decomposition of the prediction error of a model is considered known as the bias/variance decomposition. A model with a high bias lacks the flexibility to fit the data well. A high variance indicates that a model is instable with respect to different datasets. Decision trees have a high variance component and a low bias component in the prediction error, whereas logistic regression has a high bias component and a low variance component. It is shown that ensemble methods aim at minimizing the variance component in the prediction error while leaving the bias component unaltered. Bias/variance decompositions for all models for both customer choice datasets are given to illustrate these concepts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Managing Dynamics in a Customer Portfolio,"Homburg, C; Steiner, VV; Totzek, D",2009,10.1509/jmkg.73.5.70,"Although highly relevant for marketing practice, few studies provide conceptual and empirical insights into customer portfolio management. Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.",customer portfolio management; customer segment value; Markov model; customer relationship management; data mining,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-data mining
Behavior-aware user response modeling in social media: Learning from diverse heterogeneous data,"Chen, ZY; Fan, ZP; Sun, MH",2015,10.1016/j.ejor.2014.09.008,"With the rapid development of Web 2.0 applications, social media have increasingly become a major factor influencing the purchase decisions of customers. Longitudinal individual and engagement behavioral data generated on social media sites post challenges to integrate diverse heterogeneous data to improve prediction performance in customer response modeling. In this study, a hierarchical ensemble learning framework is proposed for behavior-aware user response modeling using diverse heterogeneous data. In the framework, a general-purpose data transformation and feature extraction strategy is developed to transform the heterogeneous high-dimensional multi-relational datasets into customer-centered high-order tensors and to extract attributes. An improved hierarchical multiple kernel support vector machine (H-MK-SVM) is developed to integrate the external, tag and keyword, individual behavioral and engagement behavioral data for feature selection from multiple correlated attributes and for ensemble learning in user response modeling. The subagging strategy is adopted to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. Computational experiments using a real-world microblog database were conducted to investigate the benefits of integrating diverse heterogeneous data. Computational results show that the improved H-MK-SVM using longitudinal individual behavioral data exhibits superior performance over some commonly used methods using aggregated behavioral data and the improved H-MK-SVM using engagement behavioral data performs better than using only the external and individual behavioral data.

AN LDA AND SYNONYM LEXICON BASED APPROACH TO PRODUCT FEATURE EXTRACTION FROM ONLINE CONSUMER PRODUCT REVIEWS,"Ma, BZ; Zhang, DS; Yan, ZJ; Kim, T",2013,,"Consumers are increasingly relying on other consumers' online reviews of features and quality of products while making their purchase decisions. However, the rapid growth of online consumer product reviews makes browsing a large number of reviews and identifying information of interest time consuming and cognitively demanding. Although there has been extensive research on text review mining to address this information overload problem in the past decade, the majority of existing research mainly focuses on the quality of reviews and the impact of reviews on sales and marketing. Relatively little emphasis has been placed on mining reviews to meet personal needs of individual consumers. As an essential first step toward achieving this goal, this study proposes a product feature-oriented approach to the analysis of online consumer product reviews in order to support feature-based inquiries and summaries of consumer reviews. The proposed method combines LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and a synonym lexicon to extract product features from online consumer product reviews.

Textual factors in online product reviews: a foundation for a more influential approach to opinion mining,"Robinson, R; Goh, TT; Zhang, R",2012,10.1007/s10660-012-9095-7,"While data mining is well established in practice, opinion mining is still in its infancy, with issues in particular around the development of methodologies which effectively extract accurate, reliable, influential and useful information from the raw opinion data collected from informal product reviews. Current approaches adopt a single-variable approach, focusing on individual metrics-word length, the presence of keywords, or the overall semantic orientation of terms within the data-while neglecting to evaluate whether these individual artifacts are indicative of the tone of a given review. This approach has significant limitations when we move from trying to merely evaluate whether an online opinion is positive or negative, to trying to evaluate how likely it is that the opinion will influence others. Given this issue, one promising avenue would be to evaluate the general analysis approaches utilized by opinion mining algorithms and identified in the literature in terms of how accurately they reflect how people actually interpret and are influenced by electronic online reviews. Through interviewing and a follow up survey of 136 participants, the validity of the approach in terms of ascertaining the tone of a piece of text can be evaluated, as well as the identification of measurable factors within text which make a given opinionated text more or less influential in an online context, further facilitating the development of more effective multivariate opinion mining approaches. Furthermore, the identification of factors which make an online opinion text more or less persuasive helps to facilitate the development of opinion mining approaches which can evaluate how likely a review is to affect an individual's decision making.",Electronic word of mouth communication (eWOM); Online product review; Opinion mining; Consumer decision making,SPRINGER,wos-data mining

Based on the example of Telco, the article contains the results of the implementation of various models for classification, such as logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, using Python programming language. All models are characterised by high quality (the general accuracy is over 80%). So, the paper demonstrates the feasibility and possibility of implementing the model to classify customers in the future to anticipate subscriber churn (clients who may abandon the company's services) and minimise consumer outflow based on this. The main factors influencing customer churn are established, which is basic information for further forecasting client outflow. Customer outflow prediction models implementation will help to reduce customer churn and maintain their loyalty. The research results can be useful for optimising marketing activity of managing the outflow of consumers of companies on the telecommunication market by developing effective decisions based on data and improving the mathematical methodology of forecasting the outflow of consumers. Therefore, the study's main theoretical and practical achievements are to develop an efficient forecasting tool for enterprises to control outflow risks and to enrich the research on data analysis and Data Science methodology to identify essential factors that determine the propensity of customers to churn.",churn; client; consumer; Data Science; forecasting; machine learning; marketing; modelling; outflow,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY",wos-data science
Targeting customers under response-dependent costs,"Haupt, J; Lessmann, S",2022,10.1016/j.ejor.2021.05.045,"This study provides a formal analysis of the customer targeting problem when the cost for a marketing action depends on the customer response and proposes a framework to estimate the decision variables for campaign profit optimization. Targeting a customer is profitable if the impact and associated profit of the marketing treatment are higher than its cost. Despite the growing literature on uplift models to iden-tify the strongest treatment-responders, no research has investigated optimal targeting when the costs of the treatment are unknown at the time of the targeting decision. Stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct marketing and customer retention campaigns because marketing incentives are conditioned on a positive customer response. This study makes two contributions to the literature, which are evaluated on an e-commerce coupon targeting campaign. First, we formally analyze the targeting decision problem under response-dependent costs. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the treatment effect on the customer and an estimate of the customer response probability under treatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the consideration of treatment cost substantially increases campaign profit when used for customer targeting in combination with an estimate of the average or customer-level treatment effect. Second, we propose a framework to jointly estimate the treatment effect and the response probability by combining methods for causal inference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle model achieves competitive campaign profit while streamlining model building. All codes are available at https://github.com/Humboldt- WI/response- dependent-costs .

Measuring retail productivity: proposition of a new method for decision making,"Fix, R; Pecora, JE; da Veiga, CP",2023,10.7769/gesec.v14i8.2496,"This paper proposes an elegant way of estimating retail productivity through a mathematical model inspired by FGLS multivariate linear regression, using the error equation obtained as a hidden variable estimator to be used as inferred efficiency. This methodology was applied to a dataset obtained from a leading ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) manufacturer and demonstrated substantial results. Unlike conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, the proposed approach offers benchmarking information relative to the best-performing retailers, as opposed to the typical relative-to-average outcomes of regressions. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA), this methodology relies on the entire dataset to establish the efficiency index, thereby addressing limitations imposed by DEA and allowing for executive discretion and flexibility in the analysis.",Marketing Channels; Retail Productivity; Data Science; Feasible Generalized Least Squares,SINDICATO SECRETARIAS ESTADO SAO PAULO,wos-data science
Test & Roll: Profit-Maximizing A/B Tests,"Feit, EM; Berman, R",2019,10.1287/mksc.2019.1194,"Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. Whereas these tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, we reframe them as an explicit trade-off between the opportunity cost of the test (where some customers receive a suboptimal treatment) and the potential losses associated with deploying a suboptimal treatment to the remainder of the population. We derive a closed-form expression for the profit-maximizing test size and show that it is substantially smaller than typically recommended for a hypothesis test, particularly when the response is noisy or when the total population is small. The common practice of using small holdout groups can be rationalized by asymmetric priors. The proposed test design achieves nearly the same expected regret as the flexible yet harder-to-implement multi-armed bandit under a wide range of conditions. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in three different marketing contexts-website design, display advertising, and catalog tests-in which we estimate priors from past data. In all three cases, the optimal sample sizes are substantially smaller than for a traditional hypothesis test, resulting in higher profit.",A/B testing; randomized controlled trial; marketing experiments; Bayesian decision theory; sample size,INFORMS,wos-data science
Model Selection Using Database Characteristics: Developing a Classification Tree for Longitudinal Incidence Data,"Schwartz, EM; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS",2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0825,"When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the winning model before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the legwork of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e. g., the back-and-forth migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e. g., the inclusion of an off state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general recipe for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework).",model selection; machine learning; data science; business intelligence; hidden Markov models; classification tree; random forest; posterior predictive model checking; hierarchical Bayesian methods; forecasting,INFORMS,wos-data science
The influence of targeted digital advertising on consumers' purchase intention: Comparative analysis based on the perspective of ads content source,"Han, Z; Du, G",2023,10.1002/cb.2230,"Targeted digital advertising (TDA) is immensely popular among marketing practitioners; investigating its effects is increasingly becoming a subject of academic research. Brands can push advertisements of the same product from different sources to consumers in a targeted manner; however, the differences in the impact on consumers of TDA with different content sources are surprisingly understudied. Therefore, this study analyzes the consumers' purchase intentions in the context of TDA with different content sources (stars vs. bloggers vs. top e-commerce streamers), and the perceived differences between consumers with different thinking styles. Through two experimental studies, this study finds that TDA with top e-commerce streamers' recommendation source can better improve consumers' purchase intentions more than TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with a blogger evaluation. For consumers who prefer the rational thinking style, TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better; For consumers who prefer the empirical thinking style, TDA recommended by bloggers and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better. Furthermore, this study finds that consumers' mental simulation and perceived usefulness can mediate the relationships described above, and that the two play a chain mediation role. The findings contribute to the precision marketing literature by enriching the understanding of the psychological mechanism underlying consumers' perceptions of and decision factors toward the TDA.",,WILEY,wos-data science
Perceived values on hospital services: A fuzzy logic application,"Pan, FFC",2011,,"Loyal patients can bring substantial benefits to a hospital. Service quality of a hospital was one of the driving forces to patients' satisfaction and loyalty, but it was a necessary but not a sufficient factor.

This research focused on identifying the patients' perceived values toward hospitals. To capture with more confidence the misty inner of the patients' value perception, this study adopted the fuzzy logic, a method that had been develop to reflect the fuzzy nature of human mind. Being the first in adopting a fuzzy logic in this context, this research find quality of care and physician competence were the top two value aspects perceived by patients. This was consistent with previous studies, yet some new insights were further revealed. This study used a closeness index to distinguish the best hospital that was otherwise assessed by other methods as similar to the rivalries.

House of quality: A fuzzy logic-based requirements analysis,"Temponi, C; Yen, J; Tiao, WA",1999,10.1016/S0377-2217(98)00275-6,"House Of Quality (HOQ) is one of the matrices of an iterative process called Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The foundation of the HOQ is the belief that products should be designed to reflect customers' desires and taste. HOQ is performed by a multidisciplinary team representing marketing, design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and any other functions considered critical by the company. In general, it provides a framework in which all participants can communicate their thoughts about a product. More specifically, HOQ is often used to identify the relationships between requirements based on different viewpoints. There are two issues in analyzing these requirements using HOQ. First, requirements are often described informally using vague terms. However, lack of formal way in interpreting the semantics of these requirements makes it difficult to determine if a realization of the system meets its customer's needs. Second, identifying relationships between requirements is often time consuming. Sometimes, it is difficult to arrive at a group consensus on a particular relationship between requirements. To address these issues, we have developed a fuzzy logic-based extension to HOQ for capturing imprecise requirements to both facilitate communication of team members and have a formal representation of requirements. Based on this representation, we developed a heuristic inference scheme to reason about the implicit relationships between requirements. We illustrate our approach using a textile mill supply business application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Supplier segmentation using fuzzy logic,"Rezaei, J; Ortt, R",2013,10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.03.003,"Supplier segmentation means that the suppliers of a specific firm are categorized on the basis of their similarities. This supply-side business-to-business (B2B) segmentation is of special importance to companies with many suppliers. Supplier segmentation yields a manageable number of segments, each of which requires a separate strategy. Standard supplier segmentation methods have serious shortcomings, for instance because they fail to make a proper connection between supplier segmentation and other supplier-related activities such as supplier selection and development. Moreover, these standard methods typically use a limited number of segmentation criteria and different sets of criteria are suggested for each method. It is unclear for practitioners how to choose a particular method. The purpose of this paper is to form a practical tool for supplier segmentation taking into account all suggested segmentation criteria. The principal result of this paper is the design of a rule-based method to segment the suppliers of a firm based on two overarching dimensions: supplier capabilities and supplier willingness. The method is applied to a real-world situation to show how the results can be used in practice. A general sensitivity analysis procedure for fuzzy rule-based systems is proposed and then implemented, to identify the most important supplier capabilities and willingness criteria and to formulate better supplier development strategies. A major conclusion of the paper is that the fuzzy logic approach to supplier segmentation is simple to apply in practice, yet considers all available segmentation criteria and their inherent fuzziness in a way that is easily adaptable to a specific industrial context.

The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification ofnew factors which have relation to a client's creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client's creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry.

Economical user-generated content (UGC) marketing for online stores based on a fine-grained joint model of the consumer purchase decision process,"Li, SG; Zhang, YQ; Yu, ZX; Liu, F",2021,10.1007/s10660-020-09401-8,"User-generated content (UGC) is influential in reducing customer perceived risk and determining online store sales. E-sellers spend huge costs and efforts to improve UGC for it serves as a convenient and persuasive alternative for marketing and advertising purposes. Considering that consumers may set lower and/or upper limits (i.e., psychological thresholds) in which the good is expected to be, and purchase decisions are considered as a multi-stage decision process, yet models in previous research cannot uncover this decision-making process. Therefore, exploring the impact of UGC at each decision-making stage and detecting the psychological thresholds on various aspects of UGC (i.e., the fine-grained effects of UGC) contribute to optimizing the UGC with the best cost to boost sales. To this end, a fine-grained joint two-stage decision model, zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB-P) model is proposed to support economical UGC marketing. Specifically, we compile a factors system composed of various types of aggregate-level statistics of UGC, which can impact risk perception. Afterward, change point analysis is used to find multi-level consumer psychological thresholds on UGC factors and consumers' risk perception model is constructed to measure purchasing probabilities in the first decision-making stage. On the basis of consumers' risk perception model, the ZINB-P model is built to fully capture the fine-grained effects of UGC factors on each stage of the consumer purchase decision. It integrates two stages of consumer decision: the consumer risk perception and non-compensatory choice in the first stage, and the second compensatory stage. A genetic algorithm is constructed to jointly estimate the parameters in ZINB-P model. Finally, an experiment on a kind of fresh produce from Taobao.com evidences the precision of our model. We demonstrate how our model can provide with economical UGC marketing strategies using a decision support table, in which some scenarios are identified. E-sellers can use this table to find the scenarios they are located in and identify the critical UGC factors that impede the sales in each scenario, and thus economical UGC marketing strategies can be obtained by improving these critical UGC factors.",Perceived risk; Purchase decision process; Psychological threshold; Fine-grained joint model; ZINB-P model,SPRINGER,wos-genetic algorithm

Integrating Social Network Effects in the Share-Of-Choice Problem,"Gunnec, D; Raghavan, S",2017,10.1111/deci.12246,"Accounting for social network effects in marketing strategies has become an important issue. Taking a step back, we seek to incorporate and analyze social network effects on new product development and then propose a model to engineer product diffusion over a social network. We build upon the share-of-choice (SOC) problem, which is a strategic combinatorial optimization problem used commonly as one of the methods to analyze conjoint analysis data by marketers in order to identify a product with largest market share, and show how to incorporate social network effects in the SOC problem. We construct a genetic algorithm to solve this computationally challenging (NP-Hard) problem and show that ignoring social network effects in the design phase results in a significantly lower market share for a product. In this setting, we introduce the secondary operational problem of determining the least expensive way of influencing individuals and strengthening product diffusion over a social network. This secondary problem is of independent interest, as it addresses contagion models and the issue of intervening in diffusion over a social network, which are of significant interest in marketing and epidemiological settings.",Genetic Algorithm; Marketing; Optimization; Peer Influence; Product Design; Social Networks,WILEY,wos-genetic algorithm

Extending the effectiveness of simulation-based DSS through genetic algorithms,"Fazlollahi, B; Vahidov, R",2001,10.1016/S0378-7206(01)00079-9,"Many real life ill-structured problems involve high uncertainty and complexity preventing application of analytical optimization techniques in building effective decision support systems (DSS). These systems may employ simulation method and search for a good solution through what-if analysis. However, this method is very time consuming and often overlooks the consideration of many promising alternative solutions. A genetic algorithm (GA) automates the search for good solutions by finding near-optimal solutions and increases effectiveness of DSS. This paper introduces a hybrid method based on the combination of Monte-Carlo simulation and genetic algorithms. The combined method is illustrated through application to the marketing mix problem to improve the process for searching and evaluating alternatives for decisional support. The paper compares two methods: MC and MC + GA. It also discusses ways for dealing with crisp and soft constraints contained in the example problem. A business game environment is chosen for experiments. The results of the experiments show that the GA-based approach outperforms human what-if method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

"Scheduling Content on Social Media: Theory, Evidence, and Application","Kanuri, VK; Chen, YX; Sridhar, S",2018,10.1177/0022242918805411,"Content platforms (e.g., newspapers, magazines) post several stories daily on their dedicated social media pages and promote some of them using targeted content advertising (TCA). Posting stories enables content platforms to grow their social media audiences and generate digital advertising revenue from the impressions channeled through social media posts' link clicks. However, optimal scheduling of social media posts and TCA is formidable, requiring content platforms to determine what to post; when to post; and whether, when, and how much to spend on TCA to maximize profits. Social media managers lament this complexity, and academic literature offers little guidance. Consequently, the authors draw from literature on circadian rhythms in information processing capabilities to build a novel theoretical framework on social media content scheduling and explain how scheduling attributes (i.e., time of day, content type, and TCA) affect the link clicks metric. They test their hypotheses using a model estimated on 366 days of Facebook post data from a top 50 U.S. newspaper. Subsequently, they build an algorithm that allows social media managers to optimally plan social media content schedules and maximize gross profits. Applying the algorithm to a holdout sample, the authors demonstrate a potential increase in gross profits by at least 8%.",circadian rhythms; content strategy; decision support system; genetic algorithm; social media,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-genetic algorithm
How traders influence their neighbours: Modelling social evolutionary processes and peer effects in agricultural trade networks,"Kopp, T; Salecker, J",2020,10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103944,"Marketing channel choices in agricultural trade networks affect the networks' overall performance and influence rural livelihoods. This study identifies key determinants of these choices among natural rubber traders in Indonesia to evaluate four policy scenarios and their potential effects on rural incomes. Since traders' marketing decisions are based on past interactions, resulting trade networks are formed in recursive processes and can be understood as complex adaptive systems. Due to inherent endogeneity in these systems, process-based approaches such as agent-based modelling (ABM) can be effective in understanding them. Using a self-gathered primary dataset from Jambi Province, Indonesia, we implement and parameterise an ABM to simulate the formation of the rubber trading network and analyse the effects on rural livelihoods of four hypothetical policy scenarios: improved micro-credit availability, increased access to education, better infrastructure and transportation capacity, and market information availability. The model is calibrated through a genetic algorithm which maximises the similarity between the simulated network and the actual network observed in the data. Results indicate that sellers' decisions on a buyer are primarily determined by debt obligations and past peer-interactions. The most influential sellers have a similar level of formal education as their peers and live in close physical proximity. Results of the policy scenario analysis suggests that policies aimed at reducing sellers' dependence on credit from buyers and increasing education are the most effective policies for improving value chains and reducing poverty in the region under consideration.

"Nash game model for optimizing market strategies, configuration of platform products in a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) supply chain for a product family","Yu, YG; Huang, GQ",2010,10.1016/j.ejor.2010.02.039,"This paper discusses how a manufacturer and its retailers interact with each other to optimize their product marketing strategies, platform product configuration and inventory policies in a VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) supply chain. The manufacturer procures raw materials from multiple suppliers to produce a family of products sold to multiple retailers. Multiple types of products are substitutable each other to end customers. The manufacturer makes its decision on raw materials' procurement, platform product configuration, product replenishment policies to retailers with VMI, price discount rate, and advertising investment to maximize its profit. Retailers in turn consider the optimal local advertising investments and retail prices to maximize their profits. This problem is modeled as a dual simultaneous non-cooperative game (as a dual Nash game) model with two sub-games. One is between the retailers serving in competing retail markets and the other is between the manufacturer and the retailers. This paper combines analytical, iterative and GA (genetic algorithm) methods to develop a game solution algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium.

Dual Objective Segmentation to Improve Targetability: An Evolutionary Algorithm Approach,"Balakrishnan, PV; Kumar, S; Han, P",2011,10.1111/j.1540-5915.2011.00333.x,"Cluster-based segmentation usually involves two sets of variables: (i) the needs-based variables (referred to as the bases variables), which are used in developing the original segments to identify the value, and (ii) the classification or background variables, which are used to profile or target the customers. The managers goal is to utilize these two sets of variables in the most efficient manner. Pragmatic managerial interests recognize the underlying need to start shifting from methodologies that obtain highly precise value-based segments but may be of limited practical use as they provide less targetable segments. Consequently, the imperative is to shift toward newer segmentation approaches that provide greater focus on targetable segments while maintaining homogeneity. This requires dual objective segmentation, which is a combinatorially difficult problem. Hence, we propose and examine a new evolutionary methodology based on genetic algorithms to address this problem. We show, based on a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation and a case study, that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the existing methods for a wide variety of problem instances. We are able to obtain statistically significant and managerially important improvements in targetability with little diminution in the identifiability of value-based segments. Moreover, the proposed methodology provides a set of good solutions, unlike existing methodologies that provide a single solution. We also show how these good solutions can be used to plot an efficient Pareto frontier. Finally, we present useful insights that would help managers in implementing the proposed solution approach effectively.",Cluster Analysis; Dual Objective; Genetic Algorithms; Hybrid Heuristics; Marketing; Pareto-Frontier; and Segmentation,WILEY,wos-genetic algorithm

The majority of these vehicles are returned to the automotive manufacturers at the end of the contracted term and must be remarketed. In 2007, about 10 million used vehicles were sold at more than 400 auctions in the United States. Large consigners face decisions every day about when, where, and at what price to offer these vehicles, which has significant financial implications for their profitability. To address the challenges of the distribution process, Power Information Network (PIN), a division of J.D. Power and Associates, developed the PIN Optimal Distribution of Auction Vehicles System (ODAV), an automated decision optimization system that helps remarketers maximize profits through the most advantageous distribution of their auction vehicles. At the core of the system is a combination of three models that determine the distribution of the vehicles on a daily basis: a nearest neighbor linear regression model for short-term auction price forecasting; an autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis model for volume-price elasticity; and a genetic algorithm optimizer for vehicle distribution. Since its launch in 2003, PIN has been providing ODAV services on a daily basis, and to date, more than two million vehicles have been distributed through this system.

How complex do movie channel contracts need to be?,"Raut, S; Swami, S; Lee, E; Weinberg, CB",2008,10.1287/mksc.1070.0315,"The motion picture industry is characterized by a dynamic market environment, limited shelf space and product category management, and consequently, complex channel contracts specifying the split of box office revenue between distributors and exhibitors. Although such a contracting practice creates a considerable administrative effort and channel conflict, it is not clear whether such complexity is necessary for superior channel performance. This study investigates this question by analyzing the impact of movie contract structure on movie scheduling and channel member profitability. We develop and analyze a game-theoretic model using the genetic algorithm approach and a decision support system, SilverScreener, to capture strategic behaviors of channel members in a complex market environment. We find that simpler two-part tariff or 50/50 split contracts perform as well as the current contracts. Thus, the complexity of the market environment need not be reflected in the complexity of the channel contracts.

RESEARCH OF IT INFLUENCE ON THE PRICE PERCEPTION,"Filipishina, L; Gonchar, V; Bohachov, O",2020,10.31520/2616-7107/2020.4.2-5,"Introduction. The study contributes to the theoretical knowledge by expanding understanding of auditory encoding of prices, further testing the working memory capacities, and understanding the psychological underpinnings of price perceptions. From a managerial perspective, our findings will help marketers to better understand the cognitive processes of price perception while voice-ordering through smart devices, thus improving company pricing decisions and increasing number of sales. Aim and tasks. In this study, we aim to understand the psychological underpinnings of price perception during auditory price information encoding. In particular, we research how the price pronunciation order of the item on sale (first the sale price and then the usual price or vice versa) affects the sale evaluation and subsequent purchase intention. Results. Prior to making predictions about price perception through auditory sense and its subsequent evaluation, we need to understand the cognitive processes underlying numbers encoding. Numerical cognition process follows five stages: (1) initial exposure to numerical information (i.e., numerical presentation in visual or verbal format), (2) numerical information encoding, (3) representation of the numerical information in memory, (4) retrieval of that information in order to perform some cognitive task (e.g. price evaluation), and (5) consumer response based on processed information. Thus, the internal consistency reliability of the questions has already been tested using Cronbach's alpha parameter and has been proved to be of the appropriate level. Lastly, in addition to these context-related questions, we include two attention checks questions and the question on the questionnaire purpose in order to control for random box-checking and exclude responses which guessed the study reasons from further analysis. Conclusions. From a theoretical standpoint, this study contributes to two literature streams: (1) marketing literature on pricing and (2) the psychological literature on numerical cognition. In the pricing area, the findings of the study further support and shed light on the application of the anchoring effect during purchase decisions. The study taps into the area of conscious and unconscious comparisons with price anchors and helps to reconcile previous researches who found different effects of price anchors on willingness to pay for the product or service. In addition, the study provides novel insights regarding pricing decisions in auditory rather than visual domain, laying a foundation for further exploration of this area.",IT marketing; price perception; IOT; smart devices; anchoring,Dr. Viktor Koval,wos-IoT

Comparative performance of the FSCL neural net and K-means algorithm for market segmentation,"Balakrishnan, PV; Cooper, MC; Jacob, VS; Lewis, PA",1996,10.1016/0377-2217(96)00046-X,"Given the success of neural networks in a variety of applications in engineering, such as speech and image quantization, it is natural to consider its application to similar problems in other domains. A related problem that arises in business is market segmentation for which clustering techniques are used. In this paper, we explore the ability of a specific neural network, namely the Frequency-Sensitive Competitive Learning Algorithm (FSCL), to cluster data for developing strategic marketing decisions. To this end, we investigate the comparative performance of FSCL vis-a-vis the K-means clustering technique. A cluster analysis conducted on brand choice data for the coffee category revealed that the two methodologies resulted in widely differing cluster solutions. In an effort to address the dispute over the appropriate methodology, a comparative performance investigation was undertaken using simulated data with known cluster solutions in a fairly large experimental design to mimic varying data quality to reflect data collection and measurement error. Based on the results of these studies, it is observed that a combination of the two methodologies, wherein the results of the FSCL network are input as seeds to the K-means, seems to provide more managerially insightful segmentation schemes.",K-means; neural networks; segmentation; comparative performance; brand choice; data quality; marketing,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,wos-k-means

To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism. This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy. The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies.",tourism; country clustering; asymmetry factors; supranational policy; marketing strategy,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,wos-k-means

Staying on convention or leapfrogging to eco-innovation?: Identifying early adopters of hydrogen-powered vehicles,"Moon, H; Park, SY; Woo, J",2021,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120995,"Hydrogen-powered vehicles or fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) are recognized as one of the leading innovations within sustainable technologies. However, to the best of our knowledge, only few studies have been conducted regarding the consumer's perspective of the product. This study focuses on analyzing the consumer's criteria and level behind their behavior regarding these vehicles to identify consumer segments that can be potential innovators and early adopters of FCEV. The K-means clustering method was employed to identify different consumer segments based on their chosen criteria. Next, consumer characteristics and their preferences were analyzed using a multinomial logit model to derive important marketing and policy implications. The result of the analysis indicates that 44.9% of the consumers consider FCEV as a potential alternative. These consumers consist of Innovative luxury consumer group (6.2%), Advanced eco-friendly consumer group (12.6%), and Economy-oriented eco-friendly consumer group (26.1%). Among the three groups, the innovative and luxurious consumer group, who considered all traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles with FCEV, had the highest potential to leapfrog to FCEV. These findings can accelerate the diffusion of FCEVs if marketing strategies and policy plans are formulated according to suitable consumer segments.",Hydrogen-powered vehicle; Consumer preference; Innovation diffusion; Consumer profiling; Market segmentation; Unsupervised machine learning approach,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-k-means
Segmentation of financial clients by attitudes and behavior A comparison between Switzerland and Vietnam,"Phan, TC; Rieger, MO; Wang, M",2019,10.1108/IJBM-07-2017-0141,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate segmentations by finance-related attitudes and behavior of financial consumers in Switzerland and Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach - The authors replicated the questionnaire measuring attitudes toward financial affairs as used in the study of Funfgeld and Wang (2009). In order to extract factors and identify profiles of financial customers, the authors applied the same techniques including factor analysis and a two-step cluster analysis (Ward and K-means) to both samples. Linear regressions were used to examine the impact of socio-demographic variables. Findings - Factor analysis reveals surprisingly similar underlying dimensions of financial attitudes and behavior for participants in both countries. The five clusters based on these dimensions exhibit strikingly similar characteristics. The authors also find that socio-demographic variables such as gender, age and education significantly vary across groups. Research limitations/implications - There are small differences in the composition of the revealed dimensions between the two countries, mainly a mixture of intuitive decisions and free-spending aspects. Future research may investigate more countries with comparable samples to further test the reliabilities and validities of the scales. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the instruments as developed by Funfgeld and Wang (2009) can be used not only in highly developedWestern markets but also in non-Western and emerging markets. Such instruments can be very useful for offering financial advice based on market segmentation in a global market. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence on universal segmentation variables that reflect financial consumers' psychological traits and attitudes toward saving and spending.

USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR RFM SEGMENTATION: A CASINO DIRECT MARKETING COMMUNICATION CASE,"Bratina, D; Faganel, A",2023,10.22598/mt/2023.35.1.7,"Purpose - This paper explores various supervised ma-chine learning algorithms as an additional classification method to RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) mod-els with the aim of improving the accuracy in predicting target groups of customers for direct marketing response campaigns conducted by a casino. The purpose of this paper is twofold - first, to test how the addition of demo-graphic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach - Our research em-ployed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino's direct marketing activi-ties to improve the company's RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications - The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company's own RFM seg-mentation was also found to perform well.Limitations - Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models' power. While all models developed are applicable to similar data, they could lose their accuracy when applied to data from a different industry. The company's own RFM model was not analyzed but was included in the model as is. Further insight could be gained by determining its optimal pa-rameters.Originality - This study contributes to the existing litera-ture by showing how direct marketing efficiency model-ing using standard RFM could be improved with the ad-dition of a company's customer property.

Customer sentiment analysis and prediction of halal restaurants using machine learning approaches,"Hossain, MS; Rahman, MF; Uddin, MK; Hossain, MK",2023,10.1108/JIMA-04-2021-0125,"Purpose There is a strong prerequisite for organizations to analyze customer review behavior to evaluate the competitive business environment. The purpose of this study is to analyze and predict customer reviews of halal restaurants using machine learning (ML) approaches. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected customer review data from the Yelp website. The authors filtered the reviews of only halal restaurants from the original data set. Following cleaning, the filtered review texts were classified as positive, neutral or negative sentiments, and those sentiments were scored using the AFINN and VADER sentiment algorithms. Also, the current study applies four machine learning methods to classify each review toward halal restaurants into its sentiment class. Findings The experiment showed that most of the customer reviews toward halal restaurants were positive. The authors also discovered that all of the methods (decision tree, linear support vector machine, logistic regression and random forest classifier) can correctly classify the review text into sentiment class, but logistic regression outperforms the others in terms of accuracy. Practical implications The results facilitate halal restaurateurs in identifying customer review behavior. Social implications Sentiment and emotions, according to appraisal theory, form the basis for all interactions, facilitating cognitive functions and supporting prospective customers in making sense of experiences. Emotion theory also describes human affective states that determine motives and actions. The study looks at how potential customers might react to a halal restaurant's consensus on social media based on reviewers' opinions of halal restaurants because emotions can be conveyed through reviews.

We establish a dynamic and data driven framework for predicting whether a customer is going to make purchase at the company within a certain time frame in the near future. For that purpose, we propose a new set of customer relevant features that derives from times and values of previous purchases. These customer features are updated every month, and state of the art machine learning algorithms are applied for purchase prediction. In our studies, the gradient tree boosting method turns out to be the best performing method. Using a data set containing more than 10000 customers and a total number of 200000 purchases we obtain an accuracy score of 89% and an AUC value of 0.95 for predicting next moth purchases on the test data set.

Active Machine Learning for Consideration Heuristics,"Dzyabura, D; Hauser, JR",2011,10.1287/mksc.1110.0660,"We develop and test an active-machine-learning method to select questions adaptively when consumers use heuristic decision rules. The method tailors priors to each consumer based on a configurator. Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second and provide significantly and substantially more information per question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or orthogonal-design questions. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when there are response errors or bad priors. The basic algorithm focuses on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature levels). Adaptive questions outperform market-based questions when estimating heuristic decision rules.

This study outlines a modeling method that uses customer data (product offers made to each current or potential customer, features, discounts, and customer purchase decisions) to estimate a mixed logit choice model. The model is estimated via hierarchical Bayes and machine learning, delivering customer-level parameter estimates. Customer-level estimates are input into a nonlinear programming next-offer maximization problem to select optimal features and discount level for customer segments, where segments are based on loyalty and discount elasticity. The mixed logit model is integrated with economic theory (the random utility model), and it predicts both customer perceived value for and response to alternative future sales offers. The methodology can be implemented to support value-based pricing and selling efforts. Contributions to the literature include: (a) the use of customer-level parameter estimates from a mixed logit model, delivered via a hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure, to support value-based pricing decisions; (b) validation that mixed logit customer-level modeling can deliver strong predictive accuracy, not as high as random forest but comparing favorably; and (c) a nonlinear programming problem that uses customer-level mixed logit estimates to select optimal features and discounts.",B2B; Sales data; Machine learning; Mixed logit; Nonlinear programming,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,wos-machine learning
Response transformation and profit decomposition for revenue uplift modeling,"Gubela, RM; Lessmann, S; Jaroszewicz, S",2020,10.1016/j.ejor.2019.11.030,"Uplift models support decision-making in marketing campaign planning. Estimating the causal effect of a marketing treatment, an uplift model facilitates targeting marketing actions to responsive customers and efficient allocation of marketing budget. Research into uplift models focuses on conversion models to maximize incremental sales. The paper introduces uplift models for maximizing incremental revenues. If customers differ in their spending behavior, revenue maximization is a more plausible business objective compared to maximizing conversions. The proposed methodology entails a transformation of the prediction target, customer-level revenues, that facilitates implementing a causal uplift model using standard machine learning algorithms. The distribution of campaign revenues is typically zero-inflated because of many non-buyers. Remedies to this modeling challenge are incorporated in the proposed revenue uplift strategies in the form of two-stage models. Empirical experiments using real-world e-commerce data confirm the merits of the proposed revenue uplift strategy over relevant alternatives, including uplift models for conversion and recently developed causal machine learning algorithms. To quantify the degree to which improved targeting decisions raise return on marketing, the paper develops a decomposition of campaign profit. Applying the decomposition to a digital coupon targeting campaign, the paper provides evidence that revenue uplift modeling, as well as causal machine learning, can improve campaign profit substantially.

The proposed FAIR (Fully Automatic Interpretable Retail forecasting) method supports the retail planning process with multi-step-ahead category-store level forecasts, scenario evaluations, and insights. It considers category-store specific seasonality, focaland cross-category marketing, and adaptive base sales while dealing with regularization-induced confounding.

In this exploratory study, we investigate how the brain makes purchase decisions when it encounters different types of visual presentation strategies. Specifically, we use event-related fMRI to study brain activation preceding purchase decisions under three visual presentation strategies: (1) static picture, (2) image zooming, and (3) rotation video. Twenty-four (24) participants made 60 apparel purchase decisions. Utilizing machine learning, we study whether and how various neural circuits are engaged in purchase decision-making in regard to different types of visual sensory information. The functional neuroimaging results suggest high accuracy (highest: 95%, Rotation condition) in predicting purchase decisions using brain activity in the product evaluation process. Furthermore, cross-category validation reveals the activation patterns under the Rotation condition most successfully predict choices across the other two presentation conditions: this suggests a potential universal brain activity pattern in these apparel purchase decisions. Finally, we found some brain regions (such as the cerebellum) that are less likely to be associated with purchase decisions but are considered influential in predicting online apparel purchase decisions in the context of watching a rotation product video. The cerebellar activation may suggest association with spatial cognition and virtual navigation in addition to motor control. This study contributes to the research field of NeuroIS and online shopper study. The results provide empirical evidence to support the refined S-O-R theoretical model Jacoby (2002) and heuristic information process and inform the practical implications of sensory-engaging presentations in helping consumers to make online purchase decisions.

Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10-20 (13-24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients' demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%-96% or $1.6 million to $2 million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff to the health care system.",causal forests; machine learning; personalized health care marketing; cancer screening; randomized field experiment,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-machine learning
From Where to What: Distributed Representations of Brand Associations in the Human Brain,"Chen, YP; Nelson, LD; Hsu, M",2015,10.1509/jmr.14.0606,"Considerable attention has been given to the notion of a set of human-like characteristics associated with brands, referred to as brand personality. The authors combine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. The authors show that brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers' minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from work focused on cataloging brain regions associated with marketing stimuli to testing and refining constructs central to theories of consumer behavior.",consumer neuroscience; branding; brand personality; functional magnetic resonance imaging; machine learning,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,wos-machine learning
DEPART: Decomposing prices using atheoretical regression trees,"Lu, HD; van der Lans, R; Helsen, K; Gauri, DK",2023,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2023.08.009,"Regular prices and temporary discounts are important elements for retailers' and brands' pricing decisions. These two variables need to be considered separately because consumer sensitivities to their changes typically differ. Although the scope and richness of retail datasets have grown rapidly in recent years, most of them only record actual prices paid by customers and lack direct information about regular prices and discounts. A systematic review involving close to five hundred publications that investigated pricing variables using retail scanner data confirms this, as 63% of them only observed actual prices. To solve this missing data problem, these studies often adopted heuristics to decompose actual prices into regular prices and discount depths. However, there are many such heuristics and their accuracies have not been assessed. This research introduces DEPART, a new machine learning approach based on regression trees with a publicly available R package and benchmarks it against previously used heuristics in two different datasets. The results show that on average the proposed method outperforms previously used heuristics by 26.5% or more. Additional analyses illustrate the potential economic benefits of adopting DEPART to improve pricing decisions.",Regular price; Discount depth; Machine learning; Regression trees; Missing data recovery,ELSEVIER,wos-machine learning
How Does a Firm Adapt in a Changing World? The Case of Prosper Marketplace,"Li, XL; Ching, AT",2024,10.1287/mksc.2022.0198,"We propose a generalized revealed preference approach to infer how a firm adapts to a changing environment and provide a step-by-step guide to explain how to implement it in general. To illustrate this new approach, we apply it to Prosper, which is a peer-to-peer lending platform. We develop a structural model, in which Prosper uses an adaptive learning algorithm to continuously update its predictive models about borrowers' and lenders' behavior as more data become available and uses these updated models to help assign loan ratings over time. To infer which adaptive learning algorithm Prosper may adopt, we consider a set of algorithms motivated by the machine learning literature. For each algorithm, we use observed Prosper loan-rating decisions to estimate the structural parameters of Prosper's objective function. By comparing the goodness-of-fit of these algorithm-specific models, we find that Prosper most likely uses an ensemble algorithm, which selects past observations based on their economic conditions. We conduct counterfactual experiments to shed light on: (i) How does an exclusive focus on either accurately reporting loan risk or expected current revenue influence Prosper's decision making? (ii) What is the value of adaptive learning for Prosper? (iii) Is there any potential for Prosper to improve its current adaptive learning algorithm?",choice modeling; electronic commerce; machine learning; structural models,INFORMS,wos-machine learning
Timing Market Entry: The Mediation Effect of Market Potential,"Islam, T; Meade, N; Sood, A",2022,10.1177/1069031X211068072,"Timing a multinational firm's entry into a new country is a pivotal decision with long-term impact on the firm's overall performance; thus, a deeper understanding of the drivers of the decision and their interrelationship can yield significant managerial benefits. The authors explore the mediating role of market potential by decomposing the total effects of the decision's main drivers-macroeconomic attractiveness, market concentration, social heterogeneity, and population density-into direct and indirect effects. These decompositions explain the countervailing effects of some drivers that simultaneously make both positive and negative impacts. The data set encompasses mobile 4G broadband penetration in 130 countries, including market entry timings for 28 international operators in 79 countries. The authors establish the nature of the mediation effect of market potential on the drivers of entry timing. Using early penetration data, they utilize growth mixture modeling to divide the countries into four latent segments. They validate this segmentation using machine learning with the four key drivers as classifiers; the process establishes macroeconomic attractiveness as the predominant classifier.

Based on this context, this study explores the effect of influencer happiness intensity on audience purchasing using the hard archival data from TikTok, the world's top live-streaming app in terms of downloads. The influencers' facial happiness intensity, attractiveness score, and visual attributions of the live streaming room were extracted from the videos using a machine learning method, and the estimation model was built. The findings indicate an inverted U-shape relationship between influencer happiness intensity and audience purchase, with accessories having the highest sales volume and an influence happiness intensity of 0.43. The additional propensity score matching test provides causal evidence for the negative impact of influencers' happiness intensity on sales volume after exceeding the peak intensity, which is the subject of this paper. Furthermore, we investigate the probable underlying mechanism of the influencer-audience interaction.

Modeling Multimodal Continuous Heterogeneity in Conjoint Analysis-A Sparse Learning Approach,"Chen, YP; Iyengar, R; Iyengar, G",2017,10.1287/mksc.2016.0992,"Consumers' preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model.",sparse machine learning; multimodal continuous heterogeneity; conjoint analysis,INFORMS,wos-machine learning

From intuition to intelligence: a text mining-based approach for movies' green-lighting process,"Kim, J; Lee, Y; Song, I",2022,10.1108/INTR-11-2020-0651,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a predictive model for box office performance based on the textual information in movie scripts in the green-lighting process of movie production. Design/methodology/approach The authors use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to determine the hidden textual structure in movie scripts by extracting topic probabilities as predictors for classification. The extracted topic probabilities are used as inputs for the predictive model for the box office performance. For the predictive model, the authors utilize a variety of classification algorithms such as logistic classification, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector machines and artificial neural networks, and compare their relative performances in predicting movies' market performance. Findings This approach for extracting textual information from movie scripts produces a valuable typology for movies. Moreover, our modeling approach has significant power to predict movie scripts' profitability. It provides a superior prediction performance compared to previous benchmarks, such as that of Eliashberg et al. (2007). Research limitations/implications This work contributes to literature on predicting the box office performance in the green-lighting process and literature regarding suggesting models for the idea screening stage in the new product development process. Besides, this is one of the few studies that use movie script data to predict movies' financial performance by proposing an approach to integrate text mining models and machine learning algorithms with movie experts' intuition. Practical implications First, the authors' approach can significantly reduce the financial risk associated with movie production decisions before the pre-production stage. Second, this paper proposes an approach that is applicable at a very early stage of new product development, such as the idea screening stage. The authors also introduce an online-based movie scenario database system that can help movie studios make more systematic and profitable decisions in the green-lighting process.

Letting Logos Speak: Leveraging Multiview Representation Learning for Data-Driven Branding and Logo Design,"Dew, R; Ansari, A; Toubia, O",2022,10.1287/mksc.2021.1326,"Logos serve a fundamental role as the visual figureheads of brands. Yet, because of the difficulty of using unstructured image data, prior research on logo design has largely been limited to nonquantitative studies. In this work, we explore the interplay between logo design and brand identity creation from a data-driven perspective. We develop both a novel logo feature extraction algorithm that uses modern image processing tools to decompose pixel-level image data into meaningful features and a multiview representation learning framework that links these visual features to textual descriptions, consumer ratings of brand personality, and other high-level tags describing firms. We apply this framework to a unique data set of brands to understand which brands use which logo features and how consumers evaluate these brands' personalities. Moreover, we show that manipulating the model's learned representations through what we term brand arithmetic yields new brand identities and can help with ideation. Finally, through an application to fast-food branding, we show how our model can be used as a decision support tool for suggesting typical logo features for a brand and for predicting consumers' reactions to new brands or rebranding efforts.",logos; branding; machine learning; multiview learning; representation learning; image processing; Bayesian estimation,INFORMS,wos-machine learning
Optimizing User Engagement Through Adaptive Ad Sequencing,"Rafieian, O",2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1423,"In this paper, we propose a unified dynamic framework for adaptive ad sequencing that optimizes user engagement with ads.

We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that the dynamic policy generated by our framework improves the current practice in the industry by 5.76%. This improvement almost entirely comes from the increased average ad response to each impression instead of the increased usage by each user. We further document a U-shaped pattern in improvements across the length of the user's history, with high values when the user is new or when enough data are available for the user. Next, we show that ad diversity is higher under our policy and explore the reason behind it. We conclude by discussing the implications and broad applicability of our framework to settings where a platform wants to sequence content to optimize user engagement.",advertising; personalization; adaptive interventions; policy evaluation; dynamic programming; machine learning; offline reinforcement learning,INFORMS,wos-machine learning
Learning Preferences Under Noise and Loss Aversion: An Optimization Approach,"Bertsimas, D; O'Hair, A",2013,10.1287/opre.2013.1209,"Preference learning has been a topic of research in many fields, including operations research, marketing, machine learning, and behavioral economics.

We use integer optimization to address human inconsistency, robust optimization and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to address loss aversion, and adaptive conjoint analysis and linear optimization to frame the questions to learn preferences. The paper makes the following methodological contributions: to the robust optimization literature by proposing a method to derive undertainty sets from adaptive questionnaires, to the marketing literature by using the analytic center of discrete sets (as opposed to polyhedra) to capture errors and inconsistencies, and to the risk modeling literature by using efficient methods from computer science for sampling to optimize CVaR.

Customer Acquisition via Display Advertising Using Multi-Armed Bandit Experiments,"Schwartz, EM; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS",2017,10.1287/mksc.2016.1023,"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known learn-and-earn trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser's MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel.",multi-armed bandit; online advertising; field experiments; A/B testing; adaptive experiments; sequential decision making; explore-exploit; earning-and-learning; reinforcement learning; hierarchical models; machine learning,INFORMS,wos-machine learning
Dynamic Online Pricing with Incomplete Information Using Multiarmed Bandit Experiments,"Misra, K; Schwartz, EM; Abernethy, J",2019,10.1287/mksc.2018.1129,"Pricing managers at online retailers face a unique challenge. They must decide on real-time prices for a large number of products with incomplete demand information. The manager runs price experiments to learn about each product's demand curve and the profitmaximizing price. In practice, balanced field price experiments can create high opportunity costs, because a large number of customers are presented with suboptimal prices. In this paper, we propose an alternative dynamic price experimentation policy. The proposed approach extends multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms from statistical machine learning to include microeconomic choice theory. Our automated pricing policy solves this MAB problem using a scalable distribution-free algorithm. We prove analytically that our method is asymptotically optimal for any weakly downward sloping demand curve. In a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared with balanced field experiments and standard methods in dynamic pricing from computer science. In a calibrated simulation based on an existing pricing field experiment, we find that our algorithm can increase profits by 43% during the month of testing and 4% annually.",dynamic pricing; e-commerce; online experiments; machine learning; multiarmed bandits; partial identification; minimax regret; nonparametric econometrics; A/B testing; field experiments,INFORMS,wos-machine learning

Accounting for Discrepancies Between Online and Offline Product Evaluations,"Dzyabura, D; Jagabathula, S; Muller, E",2019,10.1287/mksc.2018.1124,"Despite the growth of online retail, the majority of products are still sold offline, and the touch-and-feel aspect of physically examining a product before purchase remains important to many consumers. In this paper, we demonstrate that large discrepancies can exist between how consumers evaluate products when examining them live versus based on online descriptions, even for a relatively familiar product (messenger bags) and for utilitarian features. Therefore, the use of online evaluations in market research may result in inaccurate predictions and potentially suboptimal decisions by the firm. Because eliciting preferences by conducting large-scale offline market research is costly, we propose fusing data from a large online study with data from a smaller set of participants who complete both an online and an offline study. We demonstrate our approach using conjoint studies on two sets of participants. The group who completed both online and offline studies allows us to calibrate the relationship between online and offline partworths. To obtain reliable parameter estimates, we propose two statistical methods: a hierarchical Bayesian approach and a k-nearest-neighbors approach.

The Interplay Between Online Reviews and Physician Demand: An Empirical Investigation,"Xu, YQ; Armony, M; Ghose, A",2021,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3879,"Social media platforms for healthcare services are changing how patients choose physicians. The digitization of healthcare reviews has been providing additional information to patients when choosing their physicians. On the other hand, the growing online information introduces more uncertainty among providers regarding the expected future demand and how different service features can affect patient decisions. In this paper, we derive various service-quality proxies from online reviews and show that leveraging textual information can derive useful operational measures to better understand patient choices. To do so, we study a unique data set from one of the leading appointment-booking websites in the United States. We derive from the text reviews the seven most frequently mentioned topics among patients, namely, bedside manner, diagnosis accuracy, waiting time, service time, insurance process, physician knowledge, and office environment, and then incorporate these service features into a random-coefficient choice model to quantify the economic values of these service-quality proxies. By introducing quality proxies from text reviews, we find the predictive power of patient choice increases significantly, for example, a 6%-1.2% improvement measured by mean squared error for both in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, our estimation results indicate that contextual description may better characterize users' perceived quality than numerical ratings on the same service feature. Broadly speaking, this paper shows how to incorporate textual information into an econometric model to understand patient choice in healthcare delivery.

The Impact of Advertising and R&D on Bankruptcy Survival: A Double-Edged Sword,"Jindal, N",2020,10.1177/0022242920936205,"Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm's expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand, they increase the liquidation value of the firm's assets, which decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on the influence that the firm's suppliers have, relative to other creditors, on the bankruptcy court's decision. Advertising and R&D increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low) level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies, show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least 35%-38% (18%-21%) of the bankrupt firm's debt has been borrowed from suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point. Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially improved by considering the firm's advertising and R&D.",advertising; bankruptcy; credit; R&D; suppliers; survival,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-machine learning
Sentiment Analysis as an Innovation in Inflation Forecasting in Romania,"Simionescu, M; Nicula, AS",2024,10.21272/mmi.2024.2-02,"Romania faced the highest inflation rate in the European Union at the beginning of 2024, but progress has been made compared to that in 2023 due to the increasing interest rate. This inflation stemmed from a combination of global and domestic factors (global factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and war, rising commodity prices, domestic factors such as wage and pension increases, tax and charge hikes, and a strategy of gradual increase in the monetary policy interest rate). The National Bank of Romania (NBR) uses a combination of monetary policy instruments to target inflation and provides quarterly forecasts. However, under uncertain conditions, numerical forecasts are less reliable, and the inclusion of sentiment analysis in forecasts might lead to innovation in the field by improving the prediction accuracy. Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important in the field of economics, offering valuable insights and potentially improving economic forecasting and decision-making due to rapid technological progress. Sentiment analysis can identify potential changes in consumer behaviour and business decisions before they are translated into actual economic data, providing an early warning system for economic trends and potential crises. The methodological background relies on natural language processing to extract sentiment indices for large amounts of texts in Inflation Reports provided by NBR. Moreover, the sentiment indices calculated by IntelliDocker are incorporated into autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models to provide quarterly inflation forecasts. This type of econometric model has the advantage of addressing endogeneity. Moreover, the unemployment rate is considered an inflation predictor since tensions in the labour market might impact inflation. This paper contributes to empirical forecasting by proposing sentiment forecasts that are more accurate than NBR numerical forecasts corresponding to the 2006: Q1-2023: Q4 horizon. The new forecasting method might be used to make inflation predictions for the next quarters. More accurate forecasts would be valuable for businesses, the central bank, policymakers, and the general public. However, while sentiment analysis offers valuable insights, it is important to remember that human judgment and expertise remain essential for interpreting the data and making informed economic decisions.",inflation; forecasts; sentiment index; natural language processing,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY",wos-natural language processing
Neural networks and the multinomial legit for brand choice modelling: A hybrid approach,"Bentz, Y; Merunka, D",2000,10.1002/(SICI)1099-131X(200004)19:3<177::AID-FOR738>3.0.CO;2-6,"The study of brand choice decisions with multiple alternatives has been successfully modelled for more than a decade using the Multinomial Legit model.

We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Legit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Legit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Legit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics.

Artificial neural networks are, however, nonlinear and use a different estimation procedure (feed forward and back propagation) than is used in traditional statistical models (least squares or maximum likelihood). Additionally, neural network models do not require the same restrictive assumptions about the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable(s). Consequently, these models have already been very successfully applied in many diverse disciplines, including biology, psychology, statistics, mathematics, business, insurance, and computer science. We propose that neural networks will prove to be a valuable tool for marketers concerned with predicting consumer choice. We will demonstrate that neural networks provide superior predictions regarding consumer decision processes. In the context of modeling consumer judgment and decision making, for example, neural network models can offer significant improvement over traditional statistical methods because of their ability to capture nonlinear relationships associated with the use of noncompensatory decision rules. Our analysis reveals that neural networks have great potential for improving model predictions in nonlinear decision contexts without sacrificing performance in linear decision contexts. This paper provides a detailed introduction to neural networks that is understandable to both the academic researcher and the practitioner. This exposition is intended to provide both the intuition and the rigorous mathematical models needed for successful applications. In particular, a step-by-step outline of: how to use the models is provided along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the model. We also address the robustness of the neural network models and discuss how far wrong you might go using neural network models versus traditional statistical methods. Herein, we report the results of two studies. The first is a numerical simulation comparing the ability of neural networks with discriminant analysis and logistic regression at predicting choices made by decision rules that vary in complexity. This includes simulations involving two noncompensatory decision rules and one compensatory decision rule that involves attribute thresholds. In particular, we test a variant of the satisficing rule used by Johnson et al. (1989) that sets a lower bound threshold on all attribute values and a latitude of acceptance model that sets both a lower threshold and an upper threshold on attribute values, mimicking an ideal point model (Coombs and Avrunin 1977). We also test a compensatory rule that equally weights attributes and judges the acceptability of an alternative based on the sum of its attribute values. Thus, the simulations include both a linear environment, in which traditional statistical models might be deemed appropriate, as well as a nonlinear environment where statistical models might not be appropriate. The complexity of the decision rules was varied to test for any potential degradation in model performance. For these simulated data it is shown that, in general, the neural network model outperforms the commonly used statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. An empirical study bridging the behavioral and statistical lines of research was also conducted. Here we examine the predictive relationship between retail store image variables and consumer patronage behavior. A direct comparison between a neural network model and the more commonly encountered techniques of discriminant analysis and factor analysis followed by logistic regression is presented. Again the results reveal that the neural network model outperformed the statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We conclude that neural network models offer superior predictive capabilities over traditional statistical methods in predicting consumer choice in nonlinear and linear settings.",consumer decision making; neural networks; statistical techniques,INFORMS,wos-neural network

LSTM Response Models for Direct Marketing Analytics: Replacing Feature Engineering with Deep Learning,"Sarkar, M; De Bruyn, A",2021,10.1016/j.intmar.2020.07.002,"In predictive modeling, firms often deal with high-dimensional data that span multiple channels, websites, demographics, purchase types, and product categories. Traditional customer response models rely heavily on feature engineering, and their performance depends on the analyst's domain knowledge and expertise to craft relevant predictors. As the complexity of data increases, however, traditional models grow exponentially complicated. In this paper, we demonstrate that long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which rely exclusively on raw data as input, can predict customer behaviors with great accuracy. In our first application, a model outperforms standard benchmarks. In a second, more realistic application, an LSTM model competes against 271 hand-crafted models that use a wide variety of features and modeling approaches. It beats 269 of them, most by a wide margin. LSTM neural networks are excellent candidates for modeling customer behavior using panel data in complex environments (e.g., direct marketing, brand choices, clickstream data, churn prediction).

Does demand forecasting matter to retailing?,"de Almeida, WM; da Veiga, CP",2023,10.1057/s41270-022-00162-x,"Time series forecasting in retail plays an important role for retailers due to its capacity to aid managers in strategic planning to meet demand. In this article, a comparative experiment between two demand forecasting models is conducted to forecast an aggregate time series in Brazilian food retail on a twelve-year horizon. Performance was analyzed by comparing the accuracy of a linear model, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and a non-linear model, and Wavelets Neural Network (WNN). Performance was validated by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and U-Theil, with a view to achieving the most accurate measurement of demand responsiveness, using the Fill Rate (FR). WNN had the best performance, with a FR of 98.43%, whereas SARIMA achieved a FR of 102.23%. Demand forecasting using WNN can be considered a resource for differentiation between retail organizations when it is incorporated into their operations.

INNOVATIONS IN MANAGEMENT FORECAST: TIME DEVELOPMENT OF STOCK PRICES WITH NEURAL NETWORKS,"Vochozka, M; Horak, J; Krulicky, T",2020,10.21272/mmi.2020.2-24,"Accurate prediction of stock market values is a challenging task for over decades. Prediction of stock prices is associated with numerous benefits including but not limited to helping investors make wise decisions to accumulate profits. The development of the share price is a dynamic and nonlinear process affected by several factors. What is interesting is the unpredictability of share prices due to the global financial crisis. However, classical methods are no longer sufficient for the application of share price development prediction. However, over-relying on prediction data can lead to losses in the case of software malfunction. This paper aims to innovate the prediction management when predicting the share price development over time by the use of neural networks. For the contribution, the data on the prices of CEZ, a.s. shares obtained from the Prague Stock Exchange database. The stock price data are available for the period 2012-2017. In the case of Statistica software, the multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) and the radial basis function networks (RBF) are generated. Inthe case of Matlab software, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) are generated. The networks with the best characteristics are retained and based on the statistical interpretation of the results, and all are applicable in practice. In all data sets, MLP networks show stable performance better than in the case of SVR and BPNN networks. As for the final assessment, the deviation of 2.26% occurs in the most significant differential of the maximal and the minimal prediction. It is not necessarily significant regarding the price of one stock. However, in the case of purchasing or selling a large number of stocks, the difference may seem significant. Therefore, in practice, the application of two networks is recommended: MLP 1-2-1 and MLP 1-5-1. The first network always represents a pessimistic, minimal prediction. The second one of the recommended networks is an optimistic, maximal prediction. The actual situation should correspond to the interval of the difference between the optimistic and pessimistic prediction.",Statistica software; Matlab software; stock price development; neural networks; prediction,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MIA",wos-neural network
QUALITY OF LIFE MODELLING BASED ON DECISION TREES,"Krupka, J; Kasparová, M; Jirava, P",2010,,"This paper presents one of the possibilities of the decision theory that can be used in the modelling of the quality of life in a given city in the Czech Republic. Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city. Similar results were achieved through out our research when using the mentioned algorithms. However, the best results were achieved when using the C5.0 algorithm. Finally, we summarized the presented problems, and compared its accuracy in classification on the basis of decision trees, with classification results based on the probabilistic neural network and the radial basis function neural network.",Regional management; Quality; Classification; Decision Trees,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,wos-neural network
Why retail investors traded equity during the pandemic? An application of artificial neural networks to examine behavioral biases,"Talwar, S; Talwar, M; Tarjanne, V; Dhir, A",2021,10.1002/mar.21550,"Behavioral biases are known to influence the investment decisions of retail investors. Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic.",artificial neural network (ANN); behavioral biases; behavioral finance; heuristic simplification; retail investors,WILEY,wos-neural network
A DSS-Based Dynamic Programming for Finding Optimal Markets Using Neural Networks and Pricing,"Fazlollahtabar, H",2021,10.22059/ijms.2020.269091.673397,"One of the substantial challenges in marketing efforts is determining optimal markets, specifically in market segmentation. The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets.

Specifically, the authors examine the dynamic impact of joint resources and predict differential effect scales contingent on firm capabilities.Design/methodology/approach - This study presents a combined multiple regression analysis (MRA)-multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network modeling and investigates the complex interlinkage of capabilities, resources and performance. As an innovative approach, the MRA-MLP model investigates the effect of capabilities under the combinatory deployment of joint resources.Findings - This study finds that the impact of joint resources and synergistic rents is not uniform but rather distinctive according to the combinatory conditions and that the pattern is further shaped by firm capabilities. Accordingly, besides signifying the contingent aspect of capabilities across a range of resource combinations, the result also shows that managerial sophistication in adaptive resource control is more than a managerial ethos.Practical implications - The proposed analytic process provides scientific decision support tools with control mechanisms with respect to deploying multiple resources and setting actionable goals, thereby presenting pragmatic benchmarking options to industry managers.Originality/value - Using the theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based view (RBV) and resource orchestration, this study advances knowledge about the complex interaction of key resources by presenting a salient analytic process.

Looking for potential service quality gaps to improve customer satisfaction by using a new GA approach,"Tsai, MC; Chen, LF; Chan, YH; Lin, SP",2011,10.1080/14783363.2011.593854,"Gap analysis (GA) is one of the most popular techniques which has been widely used in service marketing to help businesses make customer satisfaction (CS) decisions through a service quality perspective. However, an assumption of a linear relationship between attribute performance and CS underlies the application of the GA approach. And this assumption is challenged by Kano's two-dimensional model which indicates the possible phenomenon of a non-linear relationship between attribute performance and CS. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to propose a novel GA approach through Kano's two-dimensional conception with the application of the neural network technique in order to extract the actual contribution offered by each attribute for CS improvement. A comparative analysis with the traditional GA approach and our proposed approach was performed by using an empirical study on a Taiwanese Human Resource service online agency. Results showed that the new proposed GA approach has higher effectiveness in reflecting the impact of gap reduced on CS improvement. This implies that the new GA approach can be considered as a helpful decision-making technique for CS decision making.

A customer lifetime value model for the banking industry: a guide to marketing actions,"Ekinci, Y; Uray, N; Ülengin, F",2014,10.1108/EJM-12-2011-0714,"Purpose - The aim of this study is to develop an applicable and detailed model for customer lifetime value (CLV) and to highlight the most important indicators relevant for a specific industry - namely the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the results of the least square estimation (LSE) and artificial neural network (ANN) in order to select the best performing forecasting tool to predict the potential CLV. The performances of the models are compared by the hit ratio, which is calculated by grouping the customers as top 20 per cent and bottom 80 per cent profitable. Findings - Due to its higher performance; LSE based linear regression model is selected. The results are found to be highly competitive compared with the previous studies. This study shows that, beside the indicators mostly used in the literature in measuring CLV, two additional groups, namely monetary value and risk of certain bank services, as well as product/service ownership-related indicators, are also significant factors. Practical implications - Organisations in the banking sector have to persuade their customers to use certain routine risk-bearing transaction-based services. In addition, the product development strategy has a crucial role to increase the CLV of customers because some of the product-related variables directly increase the value of customers. Originality/value - The proposed model predicts potential value of current customers rather than measuring current value considered in the majority of previous studies.

The bold decision to go all in: Understanding the reasons behind consumers' willingness to migrate to the metaverse,"Kumar, A; Shankar, A",2024,10.1002/mar.22009,"The study explores the reasons that drive and hinder consumers' willingness to migrate to the metaverse. To determine them, a mixed-methods approach is used: phase 1 (qualitative) involves conceptual development of a model based on in-depth consumer interviews, and in phase 2, the conceptual model is empirically tested via structural equation modeling. Results show that social presence is a crucial enabler, while realistic and symbolic threats are significant inhibitors of the willingness to migrate. Preusage cognitive dissonance significantly mediates the relationships between social escapism, social pressure, realistic threat, symbolic threat, and willingness to migrate. Specifically, the mediating influence between empowerment and willingness to migrate is higher for individuals with low metaverse anxiety. Results of the artificial neural network technique indicate that social presence is the most significant antecedent of willingness to migrate, and results of the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis highlight the presence of six distinct configurations that indicate a high willingness to migrate. This study enriches the behavioral reasoning theory by examining the interplay of the reasons influencing the willingness to migrate. Further, it contributes to the intergroup threat theory by investigating the potential link between willingness to migrate and the presence of realistic and symbolic threats.",anxiety; behavioral reasoning theory; cognitive dissonance; intergroup threat theory; metaverse; willingness to migrate,WILEY,wos-neural network

As those technologies are mainly concerned with security and users' trust, the question of how security factors and trust can influence the sustainable use of those technologies within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is still unanswered. This research thus develops a theoretical model based on integrating the protection motivation theory (PMT) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), extended with perceived trust (PT) to explore the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies. Design/methodology/approach The developed model is evaluated based on data collected through a web-based survey from 523 users who used contactless payment technologies. Unlike the existing literature, the collected data were analyzed using a hybrid structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) technique. Findings The data analysis results reinforced all the proposed relationships in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results showed that PT has the largest impact on the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies with 97.2% normalized importance, followed by self-efficacy (SE) (77%), satisfaction (72.1%), perceived vulnerability (PV) (48.9%), perceived usefulness (PU) (48.2%), perceived severity (PS) (40.7%), response efficacy (RE) (28.7%) and response costs (RCs) (24.1%).

The rapidly increasing body of literature provides several comparisons between various models. Among the most frequently employed ones are logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, neural networks and decision tree-based models. Among them, logistic regression has proved to be a strong candidate both because its good performance and due to its high explainability. The present paper aims to compare four pairs of models (for imbalanced and under-sampled data) meant to predict charged off clients by optimizing F1 score. We found that, if the data is balanced, Logistic Regression, both simple and with Stochastic Gradient Descent, outperforms LightGBM and K-Nearest Neighbors in optimizing F1 score. We chose this metric as it provides balance between the interests of the lenders and those of the platform. Loan term, debt-toincome ratio and number of accounts were found to be important positively related predictors of risk of charge off. At the other end of the spectrum, by far the strongest impact on charge off probability is that of the FICO score. The final number of features retained by the two models differs very much, because, although both models use Lasso for feature selection, Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic Regression uses a stronger regularization.

As soon as there is information on companies that did not become customers, phase 2 initiates, triggering a feedback loop to optimize and stabilize the model. This phase uses logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Phase 3 combines phases 1 and 2 into a weighted list of prospects. Preliminary tests indicate the good quality of the model.

Dynamic Coupon Targeting Using Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Application to Livestream Shopping,"Liu, X",2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1403,"We present an empirical framework for creating dynamic coupon targeting strategies for high-dimensional and high-frequency settings, and we test its performance using a large-scale field experiment. The framework captures consumers' intertemporal tradeoffs associated with dynamic pricing and does not rely on functional form assumptions about consumers' decision-making processes. The model is estimated using batch deep reinforcement learning (BDRL), which relies on Q-learning, a model free solution that can mitigate model bias. It leverages deep neural networks to represent the high-dimensional state space and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The empirical application is in a multibillion-dollar livestream shopping context. Our BDRL solution increases the platform's revenue by twice as much as static targeting policies and by 20% more than the model-based solution. The comparative advantage of BDRL comes from more effective and automatic targeting of consumers based on both heterogeneity and dynamics, using exceptionally rich, nuanced differences among consumers and across time. We find that price skimming, reducing discounts for attractive hosts, and increasing the coupon discount level at a faster rate for low spenders are effective strategies based on dynamics, consumer heterogeneity, and the two combined, respectively.",dynamic pricing; coupon; deep reinforcement learning; reference price; livestream shopping; targeting,INFORMS,wos-neural network

Identifying Soccer Players on Facebook Through Predictive Analytics,"Bogaert, M; Ballings, M; Hosten, M; Van den Poel, D",2017,10.1287/deca.2017.0354,"This study assesses the feasibility of identifying self-reported sports practitioners (soccer players) on Facebook. The main goal is to develop a system to support marketers with the decision as to which prospects to target for advertising purposes. To do so, we benchmark several algorithms (i.e., random forest, logistic regression, adaboost, rotation forest, neural networks, and kernel factory) using five times twofold cross-validation. To evaluate performance and variable importances, we build a fusion model, which combines the results of the other algorithms using the weighted average. This technique is also referred to as information-fusion sensitivity analysis. The results reveal that Facebook data provide a viable basis to come up with sports predictions as the predictive performance ranges from 72.01% to 80.43% for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), from 81.96% to 83.95% for accuracy, and from 2.41 to 3.06 for top-decile lift. Our benchmark study indicates that stochastic adaboost, the fusion model, random forest, rotation forest, and regularized logistic regression are the best-performing algorithms. Furthermore, the results show that the most important variables are the average number of friends that play soccer, membership of a soccer group, and the number of favorite teams. We also assess the impact of our results on profitability by conducting a thorough sensitivity analysis. Our analysis reveals that our approach can be beneficial for a wide range of companies.

The challenge becomes even bigger for added-value third party logistics (3PL) operators, since in most cases and demand forecasting aside, they are also responsible for receiving, storing and breaking inbound quantities from suppliers, consolidating and picking retail orders and finally plan and organize shipments on a daily basis. This paper argues that data analytics can play a critical role in contemporary logistics and especially in demand data management and forecasting of retail distribution networks. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to showcase how data analytics can support the 3PL decision making process on replenishing the network stores, thus improving inventory management in both Distribution Centre (DC) and retail outlet levels and the workload planning of human resources and DC automations. To do so, this paper presents the case of a Greek 3PL provider fulfilling physical store and online orders on behalf of a large sporting goods importer operating a network of 129 stores in five different countries. The authors utilize the power of 'R', a statistical programming language, which is well-equipped with a multitude of libraries for this purpose, to compare demand forecasting methods and identify the one producing the smallest forecast error.",Demand Forecasting Decision Making; Data Analytics; Statistical Programming; Retail Sales; Third Party Logistics (3PL) Operators,SCIENDO,wos-neural network
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND BEHAVIOUR AT RETAIL OUTLETS: AN ADAPTIVE FUZZY REGRESSION MODEL WITH LINGO BASED ANALYSIS,"Rizwanullah, M; Abunar, S; Qazi, S",2020,10.21272/mmi.2020.2-20,"Increasing rivalry for-profit or non-profit is pushing companies to devote more and more attention to pleasing consumers with excellent quality customer services. This study aims to develop a model to analyse customer behaviour in a retail store and provide accurate inference for decision making. Another critical objective for this research work is the adaptation of the faceted form of neuro-response, which is substituted by the Adaptive Fuzzy Logistic Regression Model (AFLRM). AFLRM has resulting benefits over Neuro-surface and Mean Demand Heuristic methods. A sample of 100 customers who visited or walked in the retails was used as a sample. Other than neuro-response surfaces (NRSM) and The Mean Demand Heuristic models (MDSM), the present study has accustomed a generalized form known as Adaptive Fuzzy Linear Regression Model (AFLRM) to deliver the benchmark for former models and give the highest level of accuracy for future behaviour of a customer. LINGO based Markovian analysis has also been used with the above model to understand the behaviour of the system understudy. The significance of service and product attributes is implicitly derived via the fuzzy regression model for customer satisfaction measurement. It is observed that the critical gap between the quality of product and services and Customer Satisfaction is Product/Service Satisfaction, Motivation and Buying Experience, and Credibility and Security. The authors' finding indicates that the effort of listening to the customer's voice should be more critical. Result analysis based on computational results concerning the questionnaire for measuring the customer behaviour and the system validates the model under study. Appropriate, useful with reliable action plans for every critical product and service aspect can be developed by applying the adaptive regression methodology to control the quality of service or managing the customer satisfaction, thereby providing executives with a competitive gain. Also explored the behaviour of the system, i.e., whether the customer will move to the new retail outlets or they will remain in the same state by using the LINGO based software program model.",heuristic; fuzzy; Markov process; retail customer; customer behaviour; LINGO; ISM,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MIA",wos-neural network
Evaluating relative value of customers via data envelopment analysis,"Noorizadeh, A; Mandiloo, M; Saen, RF",2013,10.1108/JBIM-11-2010-0144,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method for customers' evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - This paper introduces a variable return to scale (VRS) cross-efficiency (one of the DEA models) to evaluate customers. This new model can consider ratio values and give a complete ranking of customers. Findings - It is found that the proposed model can evaluate customers in a multi criteria context; does not demand weights from the decision maker; and can consider both the ratio and absolute numbers. An aggressive form of the VRS model is formulated to evaluate the peer-appraisal value of customers instead of self-appraisal.

Consumer Attitude Metrics for Guiding Marketing Mix Decisions,"Hanssens, DM; Pauwels, KH; Srinivasan, S; Vanhuele, M; Yildirim, G",2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0841,"Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample. For managers and researchers alike, our criteria offer a verifiable explanation for differences in marketing elasticities and an actionable connection between marketing and financial performance metrics.",consumer attitude metrics; responsiveness; potential; stickiness; sales conversion; hierarchical linear model; cross-effects model; empirical generalizations; dynamic programming model; optimal marketing resource allocation,INFORMS,wos-prediction
Analysis of customer lifetime value and marketing expenditure decisions through a Markovian-based model,"Ekinci, Y; Ülengin, F; Uray, N; Ülengin, B",2014,10.1016/j.ejor.2014.01.014,"The general aim of this study is to provide a guide to the future marketing decisions of a firm, using a model to predict customer lifetime values. The proposed framework aims to eliminate the limitations and drawbacks of the majority of models encountered in the literature through a simple and industry-specific model with easily measurable and objective indicators. In addition, this model predicts the potential value of the current customers rather than measuring the current value, which has generally been used in the majority of previous studies. This study contributes to the literature by helping to make future marketing decisions via Markov decision processes for a company that offers several types of products. Another contribution is that the states for Markov decision processes are also generated using the predicted customer lifetime values where the prediction is realized by a regression-based model. Finally, a real world application of the proposed model is provided in the banking sector to show the empirical validity of the model. Therefore, we believe that the proposed framework and the developed model can guide both practitioners and researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Group Marketing: Theory, Mechanisms, and Dynamics","Harmeling, CM; Palmatier, RW; Fang, E; Wang, DW",2017,10.1509/jm.15.0495,"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates.

A new hybrid classification algorithm for customer churn prediction based on logistic regression and decision trees,"De Caigny, A; Coussement, K; De Bock, KW",2018,10.1016/j.ejor.2018.02.009,"Decision trees and logistic regression are two very popular algorithms in customer churn prediction with strong predictive performance and good comprehensibility. Despite these strengths, decision trees tend to have problems to handle linear relations between variables and logistic regression has difficulties with interaction effects between variables. Therefore a new hybrid algorithm, the logit leaf model (LLM), is proposed to better classify data. The idea behind the LLM is that different models constructed on segments of the data rather than on the entire dataset lead to better predictive performance while maintaining the comprehensibility from the models constructed in the leaves. The LLM consists of two stages: a segmentation phase and a prediction phase. In the first stage customer segments are identified using decision rules and in the second stage a model is created for every leaf of this tree. This new hybrid approach is benchmarked against decision trees, logistic regression, random forests and logistic model trees with regards to the predictive performance and comprehensibility. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and top decile lift (TDL) are used to measure the predictive performance for which LLM scores significantly better than its building blocks logistic regression and decision trees and performs at least as well as more advanced ensemble methods random forests and logistic model trees. Comprehensibility is addressed by a case study for which we observe some key benefits using the LLM compared to using decision trees or logistic regression. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A high-performance turnkey system for customer lifetime value prediction in retail brands,"Yan, Y; Resnick, N",2024,10.1007/s11129-023-09272-x,"Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling underpins modern marketing analytics, enabling the development of tailored customer relationship management strategies based on the predicted future value of their customers. As part of Amperity's enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing out of the box. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns.

Smallholder Supply Response to Marketing Board Activities in a Dual Channel Marketing System: The Case of Zambia,"Mason, NM; Jayne, TS; Myers, RJ",2015,10.1111/1477-9552.12066,"In recent years, parastatal grain marketing boards have re-emerged as important elements of grain markets in eastern and southern Africa, yet little is known about how farmers are responding to their scaled up activities. This article develops a conceptual model of farmers' production decisions in the context of dual output marketing channels (government and private sector) when output prices at harvest time and the availability of one of the marketing channels are unknown at planting time. It then applies the model to the case of Zambia and uses nationally representative household-level panel survey data to estimate the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the government parastatal maize marketing board, on smallholder crop production and fallow land. The FRA buys maize from smallholders at a pan-territorial price that typically exceeds market prices in major maize producing areas. Results suggest that increases in the farmgate FRA maize price raise farmer maize price expectations, which induces a supply response. Smallholders respond to an increase in the FRA price by extensifying their maize production. On average, a 1% increase in the FRA price is associated with 0.06% increases in smallholders' maize area planted and quantity harvested. There is also some evidence that farmers reduce the area of land under fallow in response to FRA incentives but there is no evidence of reductions in the area planted to other crops.",Grain marketing boards; maize; price expectations; strategic grain reserves; sub-Saharan Africa; supply response; Zambia,WILEY-BLACKWELL,wos-prediction
Expression of Green Marketing Developing the Conception of Corporate Social Responsibility,"Banyte, J; Brazioniene, L; Gadeikiene, A",2010,,"Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and clean products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.",green marketing; corporate social responsibility; green consumer; Lithuanian market of eco-friendly food products,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,wos-prediction
Consumers can learn and can forget - Modeling the dynamic decision procedure when watching TV,"Song, LL; Tso, GKF",2020,10.1016/j.jmse.2020.05.002,"Facing the challenge of attracting consumers and winning market share under the proliferation of TV stations and channels, the traditional TV stations often make some marketing strategies. However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies. Managerial implications are then discussed to guide the decision-making of traditional TV broadcasters and advertisers. (C) 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

Member deliveries in collective marketing relationships: evidence from coffee cooperatives in Costa Rica,"Wollni, M; Fischer, E",2015,10.1093/erae/jbu023,"This article investigates member deliveries in agricultural marketing cooperatives. Since cooperatives depend on members' contributions to achieve efficiency in processing and marketing, side-selling by members poses a threat to the economic viability of cooperatives in the long run. We develop a model for the farmers' marketing decision that relates farm size to the share of produce delivered to the cooperative. Based on survey data from cooperatively organised coffee farmers in Costa Rica, we find that the share delivered to cooperatives decreases with farm size, albeit at a decreasing rate. The empirical results thus confirm the theoretical model prediction of a u-shaped relationship between farm size and member deliveries.",cooperatives; patronage; side-selling; coffee; Costa Rica,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,wos-prediction
Making choices under conflict: The impact of decision frames,"Krishnamurthy, P; Nagpal, A",2010,10.1007/s11002-009-9079-0,"How do people make choices when they see two equally positive versus two equally negative decision alternatives? The cancel-and-focus hypothesis argues that when people see options in a sequence, they tend to overweight the unique attributes of the first alternative. This leads to the prediction that when both options are positive (approach-approach conflict), the first option is preferred more but that if they are both negative (avoidance-avoidance conflict), the first option is preferred less. Based on recent research, we argue that this finding may be contingent on an unrecognized compatibility confound with the decision frame of choosing versus rejecting. In this research, we argue that the choice biases predicted by the cancel-and-focus hypothesis will be more pronounced when the decision frame (choose/reject) is incompatible with the valence of the alternatives (reject-positive and choose-negative) because such incompatibility increases processing motivation. We report two studies with varying operationalizations of decision conflict which find that cancel-and-focus effects are more pronounced under incompatibility. Taken together, these findings suggest that conflict effects are better understood by accounting for the decision frame as well.",Decision frame; Decision conflict; Approach-approach; Avoidance-avoidance; Compatibility,SPRINGER,wos-prediction
Fare Prediction Websites and Transaction Prices: Empirical Evidence from the Airline Industry,"Mantin, B; Rubin, E",2016,10.1287/mksc.2015.0965,"The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%-6% in transactions' prices. Our results lend ample support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic behavior.",strategic consumers; decision support; revenue management; information availability; airline industry,INFORMS,wos-prediction

Accordingly, the authors also propose that prompting consumers to consider reasons why their expenses might be different than usual increases predictions-and therefore prediction accuracy-by bringing atypical expenses to mind.

Improving customer retention management through cost-sensitive learning,"Coussement, K",2014,10.1108/EJM-03-2012-0180,"Purpose - Retailers realize that customer churn detection is a critical success factor. However, no research study has taken into consideration that misclassifying a customer as a non-churner (i.e. predicting that (s)he will not leave the company, while in reality (s) he does) results in higher costs than predicting that a staying customer will churn. The aim of this paper is to examine the prediction performance of various cost-sensitive methodologies (direct minimum expected cost (DMECC), metacost, thresholding and weighting) that incorporate these different costs of misclassifying customers in predicting churn. Design/methodology/approach - Cost-sensitive methodologies are benchmarked on six real-life churn datasets from the retail industry. Findings - This article argues that total misclassification cost, as a churn prediction evaluation measure, is crucial as input for optimizing consumer decision making. The practical classification threshold of 0.5 for churn probabilities (i.e. when the churn probability is greater than 0.5, the customer is predicted as a churner, and otherwise as a non-churner) offers the worst performance. The provided managerial guidelines suggest when to use each cost-sensitive method, depending on churn levels and the cost level discrepancy between misclassifying churners versus non-churners. Practical implications - This research emphasizes the importance of cost-sensitive learning to improve customer retention management in the retail context.

Uncertainty Optimization Based Feature Selection Model for Stock Marketing,"Sinha, AK; Shende, P",2024,10.1007/s10614-022-10344-5,"Market analyzers use different parameters as features in the market data to analyze the market trends. The feature's values act as a signal to market fluctuations. Many studies have examined these features to predict market movement more effectively. However, the method to minimize the uncertainties associated with the features is not available in the literature. This exploratory study introduces the uncertainty optimization based feature selection method for stock marketing. We introduce a notion of certainty region of the feature as the set of feature values, which signify particular happening with certainty. We use rough set theory to find the feature's certainty region and uncertainty region and measure each feature's significance. The feature whose certainty region is the maximum is the most significant in the feature space. Hence we group the features by minimizing the uncertainty region of the most informative features to get feature subsets for feature selection. We propose an algorithm based on uncertainty optimization to find subsets of the feature set for effectiveness and performance enhancement in the feature selection. We obtain the decision rules with comprehensive coverage and excellent support using the selected features. The accuracy of classification using the chosen parameters is up to 85.91%, which is higher than 79.54% of the complete feature set.

The results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a significant increase in accuracy.

BUSINESS RESCUE DECISION MAKING THROUGH VERIFIER DETERMINANTS - ASK THE SPECIALISTS,"Pretorius, M; Holtzhauzen, G",2013,10.4102/sajems.v16i4.450,"Orientation: Business rescue has become a critical part of business strategy decision making, especially during economic downturns and recessions. Past legislation has generally supported creditor-friendly regimes, and its mind-set still applies, which increases the difficulty of such turnarounds. There are many questions and critical issues faced by those involved in rescue. Despite extensive theory in the literature on failure, there is a void regarding practical verifiers of the signs and causes of venture decline, as specialists are not forthcoming about what they regard as their 'intellectual property'. Research purpose: This article introduces the concept and role of 'verifier determinants' of early warning signs, as a tool to confirm the causes of decline in order to direct rescue strategies and, most importantly, reduce time between the first observation and the implementation of the rescue. Motivation for the study: Knowing how specialists confirm causes of business decline in practice could assist in analysis and deciding on strategies for the rescue earlier than can be done using traditional due diligence, which is time consuming. Reducing time is a crucial element of a successful rescue. Research design and approach: The researchers interviewed specialists with extensive experience in credit for rescue and turnaround. An experimental design was used to ensure the specialists evaluated the same real cases to extract their experiences and base their decisions on. Main findings: The specialists confirmed the use of verifier determinants and identified such determinants as they personally used them to confirm causes of decline. These verifier determinants were classified into five categories namely, management, finance, strategic, banking and operations and marketing of the ventures under investigation. The verifier determinants and their use often depend heavily on subconscious (non-factual) information based on previous experiences, rendering them 'irrational' in modern management perspectives. Practical/managerial implications: Decision makers and affected persons could benefit from the insights obtained through this study. Confirming early warning signs through verifier determinants would be beneficial for entrepreneurs who are creditors, company directors, rescue practitioners, government regulators, court officials and educators alike. Contribution/value add: Knowing the verifier determinants could assist decision making and improve the effectiveness of rescue strategies. Business rescue practitioners can improve their 'investigation of the affairs' activity by using such verifier determinants.",Turnaround; business rescue; decision making; verifier determinants,AOSIS,wos-prediction

The goals of the study were to examine whether predictions of a change in consumption-related emotions fit actual experienced change and whether original predictions are remembered correctly. A two-wave longitudinal survey with 86 consumers in Austria and the UK showed that consumers who had bought shoes overestimated the decrease of positive consumption-related emotions over time. Results indicate that the intuitive theory of adaptation is related to the prediction bias. Moreover, participants misremembered original predictions as more consistent with actual experienced emotions.

In this article, we attempt to use features to represent reviews, which contain the sentiments of the consumers, and to predict the overall attitudes of online reviews of the consumers. Further, we want to look at which words are indicative/decision driven of a positive/negative attitude of the consumers, especially we want to identify a set of features which will result in a desired class-positive attitude in our case. Data was collected from a well-known web site using a WebCrawler type technique and we applied text-mining approach for the analysis. The overall results compare favorably with those from standard numeric based quantitative prediction methods. In addition, the text-mining methodology and inverse classification help us identify the key features that are related to positive/negative overall attitudes of online users.

Assessing Designer Confidence and Prediction Accuracy in a Transnational Marketing Context,"Zhang, D",2015,10.1111/caim.12142,"In order to boost sales in foreign markets and compete with emerging local competitors, global companies from developed countries are realizing that they need to develop products specifically for the local markets. Meanwhile, companies in developing nations are building up their design staff and seeking to establish their own global brands. This recent growth in design activity targeting overseas markets suggests the need for academic research to better understand the phenomenon of design expertise transfer across national borders. The present research explores industrial designers' expertise transfer across cultures with respect to knowledge calibration. Based on the literature on expertise and Shanteau's theory of expert competence, several hypotheses are developed regarding the main effect of culture, and the interaction between culture and expertise level, on design confidence and prediction accuracy. A three-phase experimental study is conducted to test the hypotheses. Results suggest that both expert designers and non-expert designers are poorly calibrated and overconfident. Nonetheless, expert designers are better calibrated when designing products for a foreign market than for their home market. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.",,WILEY,wos-prediction
BOOTSTRAP METHOD FOR MEASURING ACCURACY OF PROBABILISTIC-CHOICE MODELS,"SOOFI, ES; GENSCH, DH",1994,10.1016/0377-2217(94)90112-0,"Probabilistic choice models that include choice-attributes are increasingly being utilized by decision makers, particularly in the business area. The output of these models are point estimates of the coefficients of the choice-attributes and rate of correct prediction. Accuracy measures of these point estimates are either based upon the asymptotic properties of the estimation procedures or are not provided. This paper indicates that bootstrap is a method by which the assumption of asymptotic properties can be empirically validated for a given model and can provide measures of accuracy on point estimates where currently no such measure exists. The empirical application of bootstrap to a real world data set indicates that decision makers will have considerably more information about their problem than is currently provided in the point estimates of the choice model.

Managing Customer Retention in Private Clubs Using Churn Analysis: Some Empirical Findings,"Maier, TA; Prusty, S",2016,10.1080/19368623.2016.1113904,"Successful private club management requires multiple leadership skill sets and managerial capabilities including but not limited to; relational marketing efforts, quality service delivery, financial/asset management, member enrollment, and member retention activities. Given the uniqueness of private club industry ownership and member governance oversight, this places a premium on member relationships and financial performance. This study set out to uncover new ways of analyzing private-club member behavioral patterns utilizing decision-tree analyses to predict private-club member resignation patterns. Results indicated that non-revenue-generating private club events are the best predictors of member resignation within 120 days of departure. These findings provide new insight into customer behavioral patterns associated with relational marketing practices in private clubs and provide club managers with practical ways to improve member retention strategies.",churn analysis; member retention; relational marketing; private clubs,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-prediction
Classification and regression tree approach for the prediction of the seasonal apparel market: focused on weather factors,"Oh, J",2023,10.1108/JFMM-12-2022-0266,"PurposeClimate change-induced weather changes are severe and frequent, making it difficult to predict apparel sales. The primary goal of this study was to assess consumers' responses to winter apparel searches when external stimuli, such as weather, calendars and promotions arise and to develop a decision-making tool that allows apparel retailers to establish sales strategies according to external stimuli.Design/methodology/approachThe theoretical framework of this study was the effect of external stimuli, such as calendar, promotion and weather, on seasonal apparel search in a consumer's decision-making process. Using weather observation data and Google Trends over the past 12 years, from 2008 to 2020, consumers' responses to external stimuli were analyzed using a classification and regression tree to gain consumer insights into the decision process. The relative importance of the factors in the model was determined, a tree model was developed and the model was tested.FindingsWinter apparel searches increased when the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, windchill, and the previous day's windchill decreased. The month of the year varies depending on weather factors, and promotional sales events do not increase search activities for seasonal apparel. However, sales events during the higher-than-normal temperature season triggered search activity for seasonal apparel.Originality/valueConsumer responses to external stimuli were analyzed through classification and regression trees to discover consumer insights into the decision-making process to improve stock management because climate change-induced weather changes are unpredictable.",Decision tree; Weather change; Consumer search; Seasonal apparel,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-prediction
Will You Purchase Environmentally Friendly Products? Using Prediction Requests to Increase Choice of Sustainable Products,"Bodur, HO; Duval, KM; Grohmann, B",2015,10.1007/s10551-014-2143-6,"Research shows that commitment-based interventions are among the most effective strategies to encourage pro-environmental behaviors, but methods to elicit commitments from a large number of individuals (i.e., door-to-door or phone campaigns) are often costly and unrealistic. Predictions requests-a commitment-type strategy-are an effective mass-communication strategy and have the potential to influence pro-environmental behavior among large audiences. This research is the first to demonstrate that prediction requests in a consumer behavior context influence preference for environmentally friendly products. In addition, this research examines the role of individual and contextual factors in influencing the efficacy of prediction requests. Study 1 shows that exposure to an advertisement with a prediction request leads to increased preferences for environmentally sustainable (vs. traditional) household cleaning products, compared to a control advertisement, and that this effect is greater when the prediction request is paired with an audience cue (vs. prediction request only). Study 2 indicates that the effect of prediction requests on preference for sustainable products is greater for individuals with interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal.

A Nonparametric Approach to Modeling Choice with Limited Data,"Farias, VF; Jagabathula, S; Shah, D",2013,10.1287/mnsc.1120.1610,"Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these models fire the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the right model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a generic model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward automating the crucial task of choice model selection.",nonparametric choice; choice models; revenue prediction; utility preference; preference list; marketing mix,INFORMS,wos-prediction
Market Share Constraints and the Loss Function in Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis,"Gilbride, TJ; Lenk, PJ; Brazell, JD",2008,10.1287/mksc.1080.0369,"Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be realistic in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or basecase scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base- case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base- case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because de. ning the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base- case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment.",Bayesian decision theory; conjoint analysis; constrained optimization; cross-validation; hierarchical Bayes; loss function; market share prediction; penalized maximum likelihood; posterior risk,INFORMS,wos-prediction

ECONOMETRIC ASSESSMENT OF CUSTOMERS' PERSONALITY BIASES AND COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES CORRELATION,"Kostelic, K; Pavlovic, DK",2018,10.15240/tul/001/2018-3-009,"The tendency of bias identification and quantification with the goal of better estimation and prediction, grows. The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer's personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers' communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents. Theoretical implications of the findings request questioning the use of the personality traits as an interim stage in decision-making predictions. In addition, these findings fill the gap in the field of communication preference based on personality traits and personality estimators.

Selecting Data Granularity and Model Specification Using the Scaled Power Likelihood with Multiple Weights,"Kim, MY; Bradlow, ET; Iyengar, R",2022,10.1287/mksc.2021.1340,"Firms employ temporal data for predicting sales and making managerial decisions accordingly. To use such data appropriately, managers need to make two major analysis decisions: (a) the temporal granularity (e.g., weekly, monthly) and (b) an accompanying demand model. In most empirical contexts, however, model selection, sales forecasts, and managerial decisions are vulnerable to both of these choices. Whereas extant literature has proposed methods that can select the best-fitted model (e.g., Bayesian information criterion) or provide predictions robust to model misspecification (e.g., weighted likelihood), most methods assume that the granularity is either correctly specified or prespecify it. Our research fills this gap by proposing a method, the scaled power likelihood with multiple weights (SPLM), that not only identifies the best-fitted granularity-model combination jointly, but also conducts doubly (granularity and model) robust prediction against their potentially incorrect selection. An extensive set of simulations shows that SPLM has higher statistical power than extant approaches for selecting the best-fitted granularity-model combination and provides doubly robust prediction in a wide variety of misspecified conditions. We apply our framework to predict sales for a scanner data set and find that, similar to our simulations, SPLM improves sales forecasts due to its ability to select the best-fitted pair via SPLM's dual weights.",data granularity; granularity-model selection; doubly robust prediction,INFORMS,wos-prediction

We analyze a direct mail field experiment in South Africa implemented by a consumer lender that randomized advertising content, loan price, and loan offer deadlines simultaneously. We find that advertising content significantly affects demand. Although it was difficult to predict ex ante which specific advertising features would matter most in this context, the features that do matter have large effects. Showing fewer example loans, not suggesting a particular use for the loan, or including a photo of an attractive woman increases loan demand by about as much as a 25% reduction in the interest rate. The evidence also suggests that advertising content persuades by appealing peripherally to intuition rather than reason. Although the advertising content effects point to an important role for persuasion and related psychology, our deadline results do not support the psychological prediction that shorter deadlines may help overcome time-management problems; instead, demand strongly increases with longer deadlines.",,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,wos-prediction
Predicting customer behavior with Activation Loyalty per Period. From RFM to RFMAP,"Vilaginés, JA",2020,10.7200/esicm.167.0513.4,"Objective: Identify a new model of predicting customer behavior based on new variables that can be used by marketing management and adapted to their business planning. Methodology: New model has been used, with the definition of new calculation systems of the traditional variables R, Recency, F, Frequency, and M, monetary value, (RFM), related to the business periods. Besides, activation in each period P becomes a key variable for constructing the purchase cohorts of customers and identifying their potential. A new variable, Activation Loyalty, is recognized as a good proxy of the likelihood of future customer purchases. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis obtaining beta for each variable, including the periods of activation, presenting the relative effect of the variables, and the best global explanation of the model. Results: This new model, RFMAP, which includes Activation Periods and Activation Loyalty, presents a higher prediction accuracy and improvements over traditional models with a clear impact, useful and manageable lines of segmentation, and prioritization for marketing management in CRM systems. Limitations: The main limitation of this model consists that it is based on data of only one company, and it should show the value in other sectors and give a full insight through its transversal application. Practical implications: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers, not only to determine the best customers but also with lapsed ones. It gives a meaningful explanation of differences in customer behavior, which are present in the data and are being reflected in the model. Also, it provides a prescriptive prioritization of variables to be managed in the marketing plan and how to be implemented.",RFM model; RFMAP; activation periods; activation loyalty; customer base analysis,ESCUELA SUPERIOR GESTION COMERCIAL & MARKETING,wos-prediction

However, current BI predictions are rather inaccurate and short term. We therefore developed a new approach for BI prediction. Here, we describe the validation of our BI prediction approach using oncology drugs as a case study. Methods We used Dutch population-level data to estimate BI where BI is defined as list price multiplied by volume. We included drugs in the antineoplastic agents ATC category which the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered a New Active Substance and received EMA marketing authorization (MA) between 2000 and 2017. A mixed-effects model was used for prediction and included tumor site, orphan, first in class or conditional approval designation as covariates. Data from 2000 to 2012 were the training set. BI was predicted monthly from 0 to 45 months after MA. Cross-validation was performed using a rolling forecasting origin with e<^>|Ln(observed BI/predicted BI)| as outcome. Results The training set and validation set included 25 and 44 products, respectively. Mean error, composed of all validation outcomes, was 2.94 (median 1.57). Errors are higher with less available data and at more future predictions. Highest errors occur without any prior data. From 10 months onward, error remains constant. Conclusions The validation shows that the method can relatively accurately predict BI. For payers or policymakers, this approach can yield a valuable addition to current BI predictions due to its ease of use, independence of indications and ability to update predictions to the most recent data.",Budget impact; Oncology; Medicines; Budget impact estimation; Prediction modeling; Validation study,SPRINGER,wos-prediction

Is a 70% Forecast More Accurate Than a 30% Forecast? How Level of a Forecast Affects Inferences About Forecasts and Forecasters,"Bagchi, R; Ince, EC",2016,10.1509/jmr.12.0526,"Consumers routinely rely on forecasters to make predictions about uncertain events (e.g., sporting contests, stock fluctuations). The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing).

The impact of advisory services on Iranian SME performance: An empirical investigation of the role of professional accountants,"Kamyabi, Y; Devi, S",2012,10.4102/sajbm.v43i2.184,"The role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is recognized globally given their contribution to total productivity and job opportunities. However, the majority of SMEs tend to fail due to a lack of marketing knowledge and managerial skills or technical expertise. Professional accountants are in a unique situation to help SME owner/managers to achieve their business objectives and bridge the skills gap. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the factors that affect the decisions of owner/managers of SMEs in Iranian manufacturing sector to utilise the professional accountants' advisory services and to examine the impact of these advisory services on SME performance using the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm. Based on a questionnaire survey data of 658 Iranian manufacturing SMEs, our regression analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services and three independent variables, namely, knowledge of owner/manager, competitive intensity and complexity of marketing decisions. Furthermore, we evidence that the use of advisory services is significant and positively associated with SME performance. More importantly, utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services partially mediates the relationship between knowledge of owner/manager, competitive intensity and complexity of marketing decisions and firm performance. Therefore, we provide a specific, theoretically and empirically grounded prediction of how utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services influences performance with implications for theory and practice.",,AOSIS,wos-prediction
SilverScreener: A modeling approach to movie screens management,"Swami, S; Eliashberg, J; Weinberg, CB",1999,10.1287/mksc.18.3.352,"Managing the allocation of shelf space for new products is a problem of significant importance for retailers. The problem is particularly complex for exhibitors-the retailers in the motion picture supply chain-because they face dynamic challenges, given the short Life cycles of movies, the changing level of demand over time, the scarcity of shelf space, and the complex revenue sharing contract between the exhibitor and the distributor. In the face of this complexity, the aim of current research is to provide a structure for analyzing management problems of exhibitors in the movie industry. Using a mathematical programming approach and a fast, but readily accessible algorithm, we propose a decision support model, SilverScreener, whose aim is to help exhibitors make effective and timely decisions regarding theater screens management. The major objective is to help select and schedule movies for a multiple-screens theater over a fixed planning horizon in such a way that the exhibitor's cumulative profit is maximized. By treating the multiple screens as parallel machines and the movies as jobs, we provide an analogy of the current problem to the parallel machine scheduling problem. We formulate the resulting problem as an integer program. We depart from the typical parallel machine scheduling problems by introducing the time-indexed formulation that is particularly useful for solving the current problem. An important distinction between the current problem and typical machine scheduling problems is that the present approach allows for the choice of which movies to play; typically, in machine scheduling, all jobs have to be scheduled. We provide various analyses of normative versus actual decision making, based on publicly available data. The developed model is readily implementable and appears to lead to improved profitability in different comparative cases. Through sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the above results are robust to variations in various parameters of the problem. The main findings and insights from the normative policy suggest the following: Based on SilverScreener's recommendations, the exhibitor can achieve substantially higher cumulative profit. The improvement over actual decisions in terms of profitability appears to result from a combination of better selection and scheduling of the movies. The general structure of the exhibitor's normative decision is: choose fewer right movies and ran them longer. We propose a two-tier integrated application of the model to show how the model can be applied to realistic decision making. The first tier involves development of a movie selection plan to help the manager plan an entire season and bid for movies before the start of that season. An ex ante revenue prediction scheme is developed, based intuitively on a matching of the forthcoming movies with similar movies played in this theater previously. If the forthcoming season's scheduling plan can be visualized as a two-dimensional (week-by-screen) matrix, then that matrix contains only empty cells before the first tier. After a bid plan is developed, the exhibitor can fill some of those empty cells. The remaining empty cells represent slots, which can be decided during the season by either extending movies the exhibitor booked before the season or by scheduling other movies which may become available later in the season, This motivates the second tier-adaptive scheduling approach-of the integrated approach. The second tier helps the exhibitor in weekly decision making during the season. This application involves rolling, and updating data, from one time window to another. The approaches followed in the two tiers of the integrated application are quite general in that they can incorporate a sophisticated demand prediction model, managerial judgments, or a combination of both. We also propose an alternative behavioral decision rule (heuristic), which exemplifies relationship dilemmas in the movie industry. This heuristic shows that the exhibitors need to be selective in their choice of movies and may suffer a substantial loss in profitability if they place too much emphasis on accommodating distributors.",movies; decision support systems; retailing; scheduling; integer programming,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,wos-prediction
Using copulas to model repeat purchase behaviour - An exploratory analysis via a case study,"Meade, N; Islam, T",2010,10.1016/j.ejor.2009.02.033,"We develop a model of the evolution of inter-purchase times for a consumer-packaged product. After the introduction of the product, a consumer waits to make the initial purchase, then either waits to repurchase or decides not to. A repurchasing consumer repeats this decision process. The components of the model are the repurchase probability and the density function of the time to repurchase at each stage of the purchasing cycle. Issues of interest are: the strength of the dependency between successive repurchase times; the number of repeat purchases before stability occurs; the effects of consumer characteristics on inter-purchase times. The model of individual purchasing behaviour can be transformed via simulation to produce sales time series for a given population. As an example, the model is estimated for a product using Australian panel data. The accuracy of the model's prediction is compared with an existing model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

On managerially efficient experimental designs,"Toubia, O; Hauser, JR",2007,10.1287/mksc.1060.0244,"In most marketing experiments, managerial decisions are not based directly on the estimates of the parameters but rather on functions of these estimates. For example, many managerial decisions are driven by whether or not a feature is valued more than the price the consumer will be asked to pay. In other cases, some managerial decisions are weighed more heavily than others. The standard measures used to evaluate experimental designs (e.g., A-efficiency or D-efficiency) do not accommodate these phenomena. We propose alternative managerial efficiency criteria (M-errors) that are relatively easy to implement. We explore their properties, suggest practical algorithms to decrease errors, and provide illustrative examples. Realistic examples suggest improvements of as much as 30% in managerial efficiency.

In all studies, sense of understanding was unassociated with objective risk measures. Risk perceptions increased when the authors degraded sense of understanding by presenting company information in an unstructured versus structured format (Study 4). Sense of understanding also influenced downstream investment decisions. In a portfolio construction task, both novices and seasoned investors allocated more money to hard-to-understand companies for a risk-tolerant client relative to a risk-averse one (Study 5).

What People Want (and How to Predict It),[Anonymous],2009,,"Historically, neither the creators nor the distributors of cultural products such as books or movies have used analytics - data, statistics, predictive modeling - to determine the likely success of their offerings. Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation. They then discuss two aspects of the prediction market.

The fallout from French nuclear testing in the South Pacific - A longitudinal study of consumer boycotts,"Ettenson, R; Klein, JG",2005,10.1108/02651330510593278,"Purpose - The frequency and sophistication of consumer boycotts continue to increase from already high levels. Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study I show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers.",international business; consumer behaviour; brands,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,wos-prediction
Hedonic Evaluations of Cars: Effects of Payment Mode on Prediction and Experience,"Hoelzl, E; Pollai, M; Kastner, H",2011,10.1002/mar.20419,"The paper examines the effect of different payment modes on hedonic post-purchase product evaluations over time. Two theoretical frameworks-mental accounting and cognitive dissonance-suggest such an effect, but are contradictory regarding its direction. Additionally, the paper examines whether prospective consumers are able to correctly predict post-purchase evaluations and the effect of payment mode over time. In an online survey, hedonic evaluations of 346 car owners in three ownership phases (one, two, and three years after purchase) were measured and compared to predictions of 75 prospective car owners. Two different payment modes (down payment vs. installments) were distinguished. Results showed an interaction between payment mode and the hedonic evaluation of the car over time. In the first and third year, the evaluations by both groups were similar; in the second year, the installments group rated their cars more favorably than the down payment group. Neither of the two theoretical frameworks-mental accounting or cognitive dissonance-is sufficient to explain the observed relationship between payment mode and evaluation over time. The results suggest that mental accounting theory should be expanded with elements of cognitive dissonance. Regarding predictions, prospective car owners did not foresee the effect of payment mode on evaluations over time. Mispredictions are of practical relevance because they can influence consumer decisions. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,WILEY,wos-prediction

Comparative Price and the Design of Effective Product Communications,"Allard, T; Griffin, D",2017,10.1509/jm.16.0018,"The authors propose amodel relating a product's comparative price to the construal level of its associated communications and show how perceived expensiveness shapes consumers' response to the wording of marketing communications. A series of six studies shows that for both absolute low-and high-cost product categories, comparatively expensive (inexpensive) products are preferred when accompanied by high-construal (low-construal) messages, due to the conceptual fluency of the match between price-induced psychological distance and construal level. The model provides novel implications for designing effective marketing communications: comparatively expensive versions of objectively low-priced products (e.g., an expensive chocolate truffle) are best promoted through more abstract slogans, whereas comparatively affordable versions of objectively high-priced products (e.g., an inexpensive diamond pendant) are best promoted using more concrete slogans. By emphasizing the link between comparative price and the matching level of construal, the authors contribute to a richer view of the interplay between price and product communication in marketing.",price; construal level; psychological distance; expensiveness; advertising,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-prediction
Identifying Popular Products at an Early Stage of Sales Season for Apparel Industry,"Wang, JY; Wu, SS; Jin, QW; Wang, YJ; Chen, C",2024,10.1287/inte.2023.0022,"The early phase of launching a new apparel product is critical for gaining insights of its performance and classifying it into different categories such as fast selling, average selling, and slow selling. This information is crucial for optimizing product management strategies and making decisions regarding inventory planning, pricing, and marketing. Many apparel companies rely on rule-based methods conducted by experienced sales managers, which consume significant time and energy from managers and often result in delayed information and low prediction accuracy. We propose a new ranking based method to identify the product popularity that predicts regional and national rankings of products based on sales data at an early stage of a sales season. Our method enables companies to efficiently identify popular products within a remarkably short span of two to four weeks. To validate its efficacy, we compare the model's predictions with actual orders from a fashion company in 2021, showcasing a notable 5.9% increase in sales volume when using our approach to guide order decisions.",applications; predictive analytics; ranking-based method,INFORMS,wos-prediction
Estimating Social Influences from Social Networking Sites-Articulated Friendships versus Communication Interactions,"Guo, H; Pathak, P; Cheng, HK",2015,10.1111/deci.12118,"Despite the ubiquity of social networking sites, the online social networking industry is in search of effective marketing strategies to better profit from their established user base. Social media marketing strategies build on the premise that the social network of online users can be predicted and social influences among online users can be estimated. However, the existence of various heterogeneous social interactions on social networking sites presents a challenge for social network prediction and social influence estimation. In this article we draw upon the literatures on self-presentation on social networking sites and signaling in online social networking to categorize six heterogeneous online social interactions on social networking sites into two typesarticulated friendships and communication interactions. This article provides empirical evidence for the differences between articulated friendships and communication interactions and the corresponding articulated and communication networks. In order to compare the impacts of the social influences based on these two networks, we utilize support vector machines to build a classifier to predict virtual community membership and we further estimate the marginal effects of these social influences using a two-stage probit least squares method. We find significant explanatory power of social influences in predicting virtual community membership. Although the communication network is much sparser than the articulated network, social influences based on the communication network achieve similar performance as the articulated network. These findings provide important implications for social media marketing as well as the management of virtual communities.",Computer-Mediated Communication; Online Social Influences; Social Networking Sites; Support Vector Machines; Virtual Community Membership,WILEY,wos-prediction
The nested consideration model: Investigating dynamic store consideration sets and store competition,"Pancras, J",2011,10.1016/j.ejor.2011.04.027,"The nested logit model has been widely used to study nested choice. A typical example of such nested choice is store patronage and brand choice. An important limitation of the nested logit model is that it assumes that all alternatives at both levels of the nest are available in the choice set of the consumer. While there is a wide literature on the incorporation of restricted choice sets into the logit model, the logical extension of this analysis to nested restricted choice sets has not been pursued in the literature. In this study we develop a nested consideration model that integrates store choice and brand choice incorporating the formation of dynamic restricted choice sets of both stores and brands. We term the model the nested consideration model and derive the related probabilities in a manner analogous to the well-known nested logit model. In an empirical illustration, we find that the nested consideration model shows better prediction than nested logit models (with the same explanatory variables). We find that it is important to account for dynamic store consideration sets rather than static sets or store loyalty measures. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate the importance of the nested consideration set model for correct pricing and store location decisions of business managers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, our finding is that the introduction of Baidu Index, both in-sample and out-of-sample, can improve the prediction accuracy of the model significantly. The extended model provided a 55.2% out-performance relative to benchmark one. This can not only make up for official data release lag, but also help firms gain near-real-time insight into the consumer demand trends and reduce inventory costs.

The Importance of Social Embeddedness: Churn Models at Mobile Providers,"Benedek, G; Lublóy, A; Vastag, G",2014,10.1111/deci.12057,"This article argues the importance of social embeddedness at mobile providers by examining the effects of customers' network topological properties on churn probabilitythe probability of a customer switching from one telecommunication provider to another. This article uses data from regional snowball samplingthe only practically feasible network sampling methodto identify groups with significantly different churn ratios for customers with different network topological properties. Clear evidence indicates that individual network characteristics (node-level metrics) have considerable impact on churn probabilities. The inclusion of network-related measures in the churn model allows a longer-term projection of churners and improves the predictive power of the model. With no possibility to carry out repeated sampling, sample stability was checked through simulation results. On the one hand, this article highlights the importance and effectiveness of the provider's tailored marketing campaigns by showing that customers targeted by direct marketing campaigns are less threatened by churn than nontargeted customers. On the other, this article shows that social embeddedness blocks the impact of the very same marketing efforts.

Modeling purchase behavior at an E-commerce web site: A task-completion approach,"Sismeiro, C; Bucklin, RE",2004,10.1509/jmkr.41.3.306.35985,"The authors develop and estimate a model of online buying using clickstream data from a Web site that sells cars. The model predicts online buying by linking the purchase decision to what visitors do and to what they are exposed to while at the site. To overcome the challenges of predicting Internet buying, the authors decompose the purchase process into the completion of sequential nominal user tasks and account for heterogeneity across visitors at the county level. Using a sequence of binary probits, the authors model the visitor's decision of whether to complete each task for the first time, given that the visitor has completed the previous tasks at least once. The results indicate that visitors' browsing experiences and navigational behavior predict task completion for all decision levels. The results also indicate that the number of repeat visits per se is not diagnostic of buying propensity and that a site's offering of sophisticated decision aids does not guarantee increased conversion rates. The authors also compare the predictive performance of the task-completion approach with single-stage benchmark models in a holdout sample.

In particular, this research draws on an expected-utility model of risky sexual behavior to test its basic prediction that in certain conditions, changes in risk perceptions induced by HIV testing can result in an increase in risky sexual behavior. The results of two experimental studies using projective scenarios provide general support for the predictions that stem from the expected-utility model, particularly in conditions of low infection likelihood.

It Could Be Better Can Make It Worse: When and Why People Mistakenly Communicate Upward Counterfactual Information,"Li, XL; Hsee, CK; O'Brien, E",2023,10.1177/00222437221112312,"Imagine you are a real estate agent and are showing a prospective buyer a house with a lake view, but it is foggy, and the view is less than ideal. Are you inclined to tell the prospective buyer, Unfortunately, it is foggy outside. If it were not foggy, the view would be even better!? Eight studies, spanning diverse domains, reveal a novel discrepancy: most presenters (e.g., the seller) choose to communicate such upward counterfactual information (UCI) to experiencers (e.g., the prospective buyer), believing it will enhance experiencers' impressions (e.g., of the house)-yet UCI actually worsens their impressions. This discrepancy arises because presenters insufficiently account for the fact that they possess more knowledge about the presented target than experiencers do; they fail to realize that noting an imperfection reveals it. Accordingly, when experiencers are knowledgeable about the target, either because the imperfection is obvious or because they can easily envision the upward counterfactual, the discrepancy attenuates. Finally, the presenter-experiencer discrepancy occurs only when the counterfactual information is upward, such that presenters do not overcommunicate downward counterfactual information, which rules out a desire to share any information as an alternative mechanism for presenters' communication decisions. Together, this research highlights the prevalence and costs of sharing UCI.",prediction errors; self-other asymmetry; communication; egocentrism; counterfactual thinking,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-prediction

We add to this growing body of literature by proposing a model based on the idea of a satisficing decision maker. In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which alternatives are evaluated. We therefore conduct a visual conjoint experiment to collect search and choice data. We model search and product evaluation jointly and allow for interdependence between them. The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and, contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the satisficing stopping rule. Finally, we perform a holdout prediction task and find that the proposed model outperforms a standard multinomial logit model.",noncompensatory choice; eye tracking; visual conjoint experiment,INFORMS,wos-prediction

CONSUMER SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS OF MULTICHANNEL AND MULTISTAGE CONSUMPTION: A LATENT CLASS MNL APPROACH,"Wang, QS; Yang, X; Song, PJ; Sia, CL",2014,,"The prevalent multichannel shopping environment is driving many consumers to choose between online and offline channel at the information search and product purchase stages of a shopping experience. Consequently, multichannel retailers face the challenges of identifying different target consumer groups and maximizing the value of each channel by understanding and serving each group more effectively. Hence, this study attempts to identify consumer segments by examining consumers' perceived channel values at different shopping stages. The latent class MNL (LC-MNL) method, as a powerful tool that is able to detect consumer heterogeneity in the same consumption scenarios, is applied to conduct consumer segmentation analysis based on the consumer's perceived values, including channel benefits and costs, as well as different channels' characteristics. By using the survey data of 1325 consumers, results indicate two segments comprising innovative consumers and conventional consumers in terms of online vs. offline channel usage. Furthermore, the logit regressions for segments estimation illustrate that the two segments are significantly different in terms of channel attributes and consumers' intrinsic channel preferences. This study contributes to the extant electronic commerce and multichannel marketing literature by designing a rigorous consumer segmentation method which incorporates both interpretation and prediction capabilities and analyzing the underlying influential factors for different segments. The results can further provide useful guidance to marketing and sales practitioners in designing effective channel attributes to meet the needs of consumers belonging to different segments.",Multichannel and multistage shopping; Consumer segmentation; Perceived channel value; Latent class MNL approach,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV,wos-prediction

Subsequently, it offers an equity-theory-based prediction of the attribute's declining relevance/trivialization and quantifies its trade-offs with other attributes by calculating global/local price premiums. Conjoint experiments in two countries (Austria and India) reveal that (1) emerging- (developed-) market consumers exhibit relative preference for global (local) products, (2) emerging-market consumers perceive higher preference inequity between global and local products than developed-market consumers, and (3) the corresponding inequity triggers consumers' cognitive inequity regulation (manifested through attribute trivialization in developed markets) and behavioral inequity regulation (manifested through asymmetrical willingness to pay for global/local products across developed/emerging markets). In addition, attribute trivialization and price premium tolerance are moderated by consumers' spatial identities and price segment.

We consider that a client with low heterogeneity is not highly dependent on the business and is more likely to defect. To check if this intuition is true, we will test the dependence of heterogeneity and churn with real data.

When consumers follow their feelings: The impact of affective or cognitive focus on the basis of consumers' choice,"Scarabis, M; Florack, A; Gosejohann, S",2006,10.1002/mar.20144,"The authors assumed that automatic preferences based on lowerorder affective processes have a greater impact on choice when people focus on their affective response to choice options (affective focus) than when they try to find reasons for their preferences (cognitive focus). They further supposed that the impact of the focus during decision making is less important when the cognitive resources of consumers are constrained. In an experiment, participants had to choose between two options while the cognitive or affective focus and processing resources were manipulated. Measures of automatic preferences correlated with choice under an affective, but not under a cognitive, focus. In contrast to expectations, this effect of focus was not moderated by the manipulation of processing resources. Interestingly, the automatic measures contributed to the prediction of choice under an affective focus independently and apart from self-report measures.

By modeling the coevolution of individual users' friendship tie formations (when and with whom) and their concurrent online activities, the authors uncover important drivers underlying individuals' friendship decisions and, at the same time, quantify the resulting peer effects on individuals' actions. They estimate their model using a novel data set capturing the continuous development of a network and users' entire action histories within the network. The results reveal that similarity (homophily) with a potential friend, the properties of a potential friend's network, and the potential friend's domain expertise all play a role in friendship formation. Via prediction exercises, the authors find that stimulating anime watching is the most effective sitewide intervention, which leads to the highest overall site traffic and the largest number of active users, and that recommending a friend of a friend as a potential friend is the most effective strategy in stimulating friendship tie formation. In contrast to the common finding for static networks, the results indicate that seeding to users with the most friends is not the most effective strategy to increase users' activity levels in an evolving network.",social network formation; product adoption; user-generated content; peer effects,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-prediction
Simulated maximum likelihood estimation of the sequential search model,"Chung, JH; Chintagunta, P; Misra, S",2024,10.1007/s11129-024-09281-4,"We propose a new approach to simulate the likelihood of the sequential search model. By allowing search costs to be heterogeneous across consumers and products, we directly compute the joint probability of the search and purchase decisions when consumers are searching for the idiosyncratic preference shocks in their utility functions. Under the assumptions of Weitzman's sequential search algorithm, the proposed procedure recursively makes random draws for each quantity that requires numerical integration while enforcing the conditions stipulated by the algorithm. In an extensive simulation study, we compare the proposed method with existing likelihood simulators that have recently been used to estimate the sequential search model. The proposed method attributes the uncertainty in the search order to the consumer-product-level distribution of search costs and the uncertainty in the purchase decision to the distribution of match values across consumers and products. This results in more precise estimation and an improvement in prediction accuracy. We also show that the proposed method allows for different assumptions on the search cost distribution and that it recovers consumers' relative preferences even if the utility function and/or the search cost distribution is mis-specified. We then apply our approach to online search data from Expedia for field-data validation. From a substantive perspective, we find that search costs and position effects affect products in the lower part of the product listing page more than they do those in the upper part of the page.",Simulated maximum likelihood; Consumer search; Sequential search; Search cost; C51; D43; D83; M3,SPRINGER,wos-prediction
COMPARING BETWEEN PRODUCT-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL IMPULSE BUYING TENDENCY: DOES SHOPPERS' PERSONALITY INFLUENCE THEIR IMPULSE BUYING TENDENCY?,"Parsad, C; Prashar, S; Vijay, TS",2019,10.21315/aamj2019.24.2.3,"The sudden urge to buy, referred to as impulsive buying, is triggered by both a gamut of extraneous, market-related stimuli and internal psychological factors. The extant literature on this has majorly focused on the antecedents of impulsive shopping, prominent among these include traits (like sensation-seeking and impulse buying tendency or IBT), motives (utilitarian, hedonic), shoppers' resources (time and money), and marketing stimuli. Although personality is a key determinant of consumer decision-making, the role of personality traits, specially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, in impulse buying is not conclusive. Also, there exists a need for analysing impulse buying behaviour with respect to product-specific situations rather than general IBT. The present study fills this gap by analysing the role of three personality traits on impulse buying. A scenario-based online experiment was conducted, and the sample respondents were randomly categorised into two groups. The former group had respondents with an instrument to measure their IBT in general, while the later had respondents for whom the instrument was shared with a scenario built around the product category of apparel. With the data set of 386 respondents, the study reveals that the relationships between the two personality traits-extraversion and neuroticism, and IBT-are independent of the product category. However, the influence of conscientiousness on impulsive buying tendency depends on the product category. The study concludes with managerial implications.",extraversion; impulse buying; neuroticism; conscientiousness; impulsive buying tendency,PENERBIT UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA,wos-prediction
A case study for predicting the success possibility of supply chain practices implementation using AHP approach,"Gorane, S; Kant, R",2016,10.1108/JBIM-05-2014-0098,"Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to predict the success possibility of supply chain practices (SCPs) implementation based on ten selected SCPs using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted, and for the same, data were collected from two organizations. The data collected from both the organizations were analyzed using AHP. The pair-wise comparisons of SCPs (usually, alternatives and attributes) are established using a scale indicating the strength with which one SCP dominates another with respect to higher-level SCPs. This scaling process then translated into priority weights. Once the priority weights of the elements/determinants of the module have been calculated, the presence of the corresponding element in the organization was evaluated. An evaluation rating of these elements multiplied by the established priority weights have determined the prediction weight for each SCP. Findings - The application of this procedure is described for the institutionalization module and can be similarly extended to the other SCPs/SCM implementation modules. By establishing the prediction weight for each module, the organizations will be able to evaluate the strength of the corresponding factors present before embarking on the SCPs. The organization can identify and create awareness of the essential elements in the SCPs implementation process and identify the actions necessary before implementing SCPs. The AHP can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation, especially for medium-and large-scale organizations. Research limitations/implications - The priority weights are subjective and assigned as per the judgment of SCM managers from both the organizations. Further, the priority weights can be obtained from more industry experts through a questionnaire. Second, in this model, only ten practices are taken into consideration for successful SCPs implementation; more practices may be included in future research. Practical implications - The methodological approach presented can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation in an organization. The outcome will aid practitioners to know the SCPs and benchmark the organizations on the basis of the methodological research conducted. Again, this model can simply act as a possible research model and the data can act as an example that can be utilized for other studies. Originality/value - This is the first kind of study which identified ten SCPs and further deployed AHP approach to see the success possibility of combined SCPs that influence the SCM implementation in an organization.",AHP; Case study; Supply chain management; Supply chain practices,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-prediction
When does an ethical attribute matter for product evaluation? The role of warm-glow feelings for low-rated products,"Bezençon, V; Girardin, F; Lunardo, R",2020,10.1002/mar.21403,"Research on the effects of ethical attributes has recently gained traction. However, limited research has addressed consumer response to ethical attributes in the current context where product ratings have become of primary importance to make decisions. Specifically, this study examines the relative effect of ethical attributes on product evaluations across different product ratings. Building on cue consistency theory and the negativity bias, we suggest that ethical attributes gain weight when consumers evaluate a low-rated product. This process leads consumers to anticipate more warm-glow feelings, generating better evaluations for such low-rated products featuring an ethical attribute (vs. another type of attribute). Two experiments provide consistent empirical support for this prediction, and demonstrate that, compared to other attributes or no attribute, an ethical attribute increases product evaluations to a larger extent when the product received low (vs. higher) ratings. We show that this effect occurs because of warm-glow feelings: when product ratings are low, consumers anticipate more warm-glow feelings from purchasing a product with an ethical attribute (vs. another type of attribute), leading to better product evaluations. These findings have direct managerial and ethical implications for practitioners.",cue consistency; ethical attribute; ethical product; negativity bias; product ratings; sustainable attribute; sustainable product; warm-glow feelings,WILEY,wos-prediction
Toward a unified theory of consumer acceptance technology,"Kulviwat, S; Bruner, GC; Kumar, A; Nasco, SA; Clark, T",2007,10.1002/mar.20196,"In the last few decades, scholars and practitioners have increasingly tried to understand the factors that influence technology acceptance. Theories and models developed by scholars have tended to focus on the role of cognition and have rarely included affect. The few studies that have incorporated affect have tended to measure a single emotion rather than modeling it comprehensively. This research addresses that inadequacy in our understanding of technology adoption by merging two previously unrelated models: TAM (the Technology Acceptance Model) and PAD (the Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance paradigm of affect). This study also examines an enhanced view of cognition. The product of this unified theoretical framework is referred to as the Consumer Acceptance of Technology (CAT) model. The results of a test using structural equation modeling provide empirical support for the model. Overall, the CAT model explains over 50% of the variance in consumer adoption intentions, a considerable increase compared to TAM. These findings suggest that substantial improvement in the prediction of technology adoption decisions is possible by use of this model with its integration of affect and cognition.

Cumulative Timed Intent: A New Predictive Tool for Technology Adoption,"Van Ittersum, K; Feinberg, FM",2010,10.1509/jmkr.47.5.808,"Despite multiple calls for the integration of time into behavioral intent measurement, surprisingly little academic research has examined timed intent measures directly. In two empirical studies, the authors estimate individual-level cumulative adoption likelihood curves curves calibrated on self-reported adoption likelihoods for cumulative time intervals across a fixed horizon of 478 managerial decision makers, self-predicting whether and when they will adopt a relevant technology. A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a fixed period of two years. The results hold great promise for further research on using and optimizing cumulative timed intent measures across a variety of application domains.",self-reported intentions; cumulative timed intent; technology adoption; predictive accuracy; hierarchical Bayes,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-prediction
Observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity in brand-choice models,"Horsky, D; Misra, S; Nelson, P",2006,10.1287/mksc.1050.0192,"This paper extends the scanner-based choice literature by explicitly incorporating individual-level brand-preference data. We illustrate our model using a unique data set that combines survey and scanner data collected from the same individuals. The addition of individual-specific brand-preference information significantly improves fit and prediction. Furthermore, this observed heterogeneity better explains choice than does unobserved heterogeneity in the standard scanner model's parameters. More importantly, we find that the standard model underestimates the importance of consumers' brand preferences and overestimates both brand loyalties and price sensitivities. Brand loyalty is overestimated because models without preference information confound state dependence, heterogeneity, and preference effects. Price sensitivities are inflated because the average preference-based consumer is implicitly assumed to be more willing to switch from his preferred brand than is the real preference-based consumer. Further, standard models overestimate the heterogeneity in price and loyalty sensitivities and misidentify both price- and loyalty-sensitive consumers. The managerial implications of our findings and the applicability of our methodology when survey data are collected infrequently and for only a subsample of consumers are pursued. We demonstrate that even under these circumstances better populationwide pricing and promotion decisions are identified and more accurate targeting results.",discrete choice; heterogeneity; scanner data,INFORMS,wos-prediction
To neglect or to consider? Opportunity cost consideration during product sampling can accelerate satiation,"Bilgin, B; Lefkeli, D",2023,10.1002/mar.21836,"Sampling provides limited experience with an offering to promote its purchase, either now or later. Sampling involves an ongoing choice about whether to buy the sampled option. We propose that ongoing choice feels more like a choice when people consider opportunity costs. Consequently, we predict that opportunity cost consideration will accentuate the impact of ongoing choosing on enjoyment over time of the sampled option (i.e., a slope effect). It follows that when ongoing decision evolves toward not choosing the sampled option today, its negative impact on enjoyment should become more pronounced when people consider their opportunity costs, decreasing overall enjoyment. Studies 1, 2, and 3 provided support for this key prediction. Studies 4 and 5 showed that when the best alternative use of a resource people considered was more attractive, they experienced accelerated satiation from an unchosen sampled option. While previous research showed that opportunity cost consideration accentuated the impact of one-time choice on evaluation (i.e., intercept effect), we showed that it accentuated the impact of ongoing choice on enjoyment over time (i.e., slope effect). We also contribute to the understanding of the factors that increase overall enjoyment of a sampling experience, which should influence future purchase likelihood.",enjoyment; financial constraints; ongoing choice; opportunity costs; sampling; satiation,WILEY,wos-prediction
Testing a theory of strategic multi-product choice,"Fox, EJ; Pulgar, H; Semple, JH",2024,10.1007/s11129-024-09280-5,"This paper tests a theory of strategic multi-product choice (SMPC) using empirical evidence from a large-scale choice experiment, two smaller longitudinal choice experiments, and multi-market panel data. Multi-product choice involves two stages. In the first stage, the consumer chooses a set of substitutable products, where set refers to both the variety of alternatives and the quantities of each. In the second stage, the set is consumed. Assuming consumers are strategic, their consumption decisions will consider both the utility of whichever product is selected for consumption and the expected utility (i.e., value) of the set that remains. SMPC therefore requires a dynamic model. We test two such dynamic models in this paper. These models are derived from a basic random utility framework with a stochastic error term for the utility of each product alternative at the moment of consumption. Despite maintaining state variables for the quantity of every alternative, these SMPC dynamic models offer both a value function and optimal consumption policy in closed form. These structures allow us to test for strategic consumption in the second stage and for optimality of the choice sets selected in the first stage. Data from the large-scale choice experiment and the smaller longitudinal choice experiments support strategic consumer decision-making, consistent with SMPC theory. SMPC theory further predicts that the amount of variety consumers select will be higher for lower consumption rates and lower for higher consumption rates. Evidence from panel data of yogurt purchases supports this prediction. While we find that consumption choices are consistent with SMPC theory, they are not consistent with alternative explanations such as variety seeking or diversification bias. Viewed in its entirety, the empirical evidence presented in this paper confirms that both the choice set selected and the way it is consumed are consistent with dynamic models of future preference uncertainty.",Multi-product choice; Dynamic programming; Discrete choice modeling; M310,SPRINGER,wos-prediction
Demand Estimation Under Uncertain Consideration Sets,"Jagabathula, S; Mitrofanov, D; Vulcano, G",2024,10.1287/opre.2022.0006,"To estimate customer demand, choice models rely both on what the individuals do and do not purchase. A customer may not purchase a product because it was not offered but also because it was not considered. To account for this behavior, existing literature has proposed the so-called consider-then-choose (CTC) models, which posit that customers sample a consideration set and then choose the most preferred product from the intersection of the offer set and the consideration set. CTC models have been studied quite extensively in the marketing literature. More recently, they have gained popularity within the operations management (OM) literature to make assortment and pricing decisions. Despite their richness, CTC models are difficult to estimate in practice because firms typically do not observe customers' consideration sets. Therefore, the common assumption in OM has been that customers consider everything on offer, so the consideration set is the same as the offer set. This raises the following question: When firms only collect transaction data, do CTC models provide any predictive advantage over classic choice models? More precisely, under what conditions do CTC models outperform (if ever) classic choice models in terms of prediction accuracy? In this work, we study a general class of CTC models. We propose techniques to estimate these models efficiently from sales transaction data. We then compare their performance against the classic approach. We find that CTC models outperform standard choice models when there is noise in the offer set information and the noise is asymmetric across the training and test offer sets but otherwise lead to no particular predictive advantage over the classic approach. We also demonstrate the benefits of using CTC models in real-world retail settings. In particular, we show that CTC models calibrated on retail transaction data are better at long-term and warehouse level sales forecasts. We also evaluate their performance in the context of an online platform setting: a peer-to-peer car sharing company. In this context, offer sets are even difficult to define. We observe a remarkable performance of CTC models over standard choice models therein.",choice-based demand; consideration sets; consider-then-choose models; peer-to-peer platforms; retail operations; market analytics,INFORMS,wos-prediction
"The more I err, the less I pay Effect of firm recall experience, firm type and recall severity on remedy to consumers","Muralidharan, E; Bapuji, H; Hora, M",2019,10.1108/EJM-12-2017-0964,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of firm characteristics and crisis characteristics on remedies offered to consumers by firms in the event of a product recall crisis. Design/methodology/approach Published data on 868 product recalls in the US toy industry from 1988 to 2011 have been used to investigate the effects of firm experience in product recalls, type of firm (company versus intermediary) and product recall severity in predicting remedies offered to consumers in the event of a product recall. Findings The findings show that firm recall experience, firm type and recall severity are negatively associated with recall remedies offered. Specifically, firms offer lower remedies if they have higher recall experience, if they are upstream firms in the supply chain (farther from consumers) and if the recall is more severe. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses on the toy industry and does not consider product complexity, firm reputation and the role of external regulatory agencies in the prediction of remedies offered by firms. Future research may extend this study to include the above factors. Practical implications - Offering a high remedy to consumers of a recalled product may be a responsible decision by a firm, but it may also attract shareholder wrath.

Experimental evidence for agency models of salesforce compensation,"Ghosh, M; John, G",2000,10.1287/mksc.19.4.348.11792,"Academic work on sales compensation plans features agency models prominently, and these models have also been used to build decision aids for managers. However, empirical support remains sketchy. We conducted three experiments to investigate three unresolved predictions involving the incentive-insurance trade-off posited in the model. First, compensation should be less incentive loaded with greater effort-output uncertainty so as to provide additional insurance to a risk-averse agent. Second, flat wages should be used for verifiable effort so as to avoid unnecessary incentives. Third, less incentive-loaded plans should be used with more risk-averse agents so as to provide additional insurance. Our design implemented explicit solutions from a specific agency model, which offers greater internal validity, compared to extant laboratory designs that either did not implement explicit solutions or excluded certain parameters. In Experiment I, data from working manager subjects supported the first prediction but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. We interpret this as disclosing the model's core circumstance, wherein it orders the data when the incentive-insurance trade-off is relevant. Thus, when verifiable effort made incentives moot, as is the case for the second prediction, the model failed to order the data. Building on these results, we reasoned that the third prediction should find support among risk-averse agents but not among risk-neutral agents, because insurance is a moot point with the latter agents. To this end, we added risk-neutral utility functions for agents in Experiment II. Data from MBA-candidate student subjects supported the predictions, but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. In those cells in which the incentive-insurance trade-off was moot (either because of risk-neutrality or else verifiability), the data did not support the predictions. We confronted several validity threats to these results. To begin, Experiment I used the standard agency solution, which equalizes an agent's expected utility from the predicted plan with his expected utility from rejecting it. Subjects might have broken these ties on such grounds as fairness. To assess whether this confounded the results, we derived new solutions in Experiment II that broke ties in favor of the predicted plan (by a 10% margin in the expected utility). Our results were robust to this change. Second, our agents' behavior in Experiments I and II was much more consistent with predictions, compared to the principals' behavior, which brought up task comprehension as a validity threat because our principals faced a more complex experimental task than the agents. To address this threat, we used three decision rounds in Experiment III to reduce the principals' task comprehension problems. A related validity threat arose from the relatively small gap in some cells between a principal's predicted expected utility and the principal's next best choice. To address this threat, we derived new solutions with larger gaps to make the principal's choices easier. The results were again robust to these changes, which removes these validity threats. We also addressed two alternative explanations. Might principals be predisposed to pick salary plus commission plans regardless of the model's predictions? If so, we should find such plans chosen uniformly across different experimental conditions. Pooling the data from our three experiments, we rejected this predisposition explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with treatment differences across cells. Second, might agents choose higher effort levels because of a demand bias? If so, we should find agents picking high effort regardless of the plan actually offered to them. Using pooled data, we rejected this explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with a utility-maximizing reaction to the plan actually offered to them. Finally, we included manipulation checks to assess whether principals and agents perceived experimental stimuli identically, as per the common knowledge assumption in game theory. These data showed no differences between agents' and principals' perceptions of stimuli. Our experiments move the literature from simply asking whether the model works to pinpointing the circumstances in which it orders behavior. The primary stylized fact we uncovered is the persistent and striking lack of support for the agency model outside of the circumstance in which risk-averse agents undertake nonverifiable effort. The model's failure when there is no material insurance-incentive tradeoff deserves scrutiny in future work.",experimental economics; agency theory; sales compensation; salesforce,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,wos-prediction
Trusting Humans and Avatars: A Brain Imaging Study Based on Evolution Theory,"Riedl, R; Mohr, PNC; Kening, PH; Davis, FD; Hekeren, HR",2014,10.2753/MIS0742-1222300404,"Avatars, as virtual humans possessing realistic faces, are increasingly used for social and economic interaction on the Internet. Research has already determined that avatar-based communication may increase perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3) the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.",agent; avatar; brain; cognitive neuroscience; evolutionary psychology; evolution theory; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); medial frontal cortex (MFC); mentalizing; NeuroIS; theory-of-mind (TOM),"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-prediction
A Multiactivity Latent Attrition Model for Customer Base Analysis,"Schweidel, DA; Park, YH; Jamal, Z",2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0832,"Customer base analysis is a key element in customer valuation and can provide guidance for decisions such as resource allocation.

In addition to finding evidence of coincidence between the activities while customers are alive, we find that the latent attrition processes are related.

"Exchange characteristics, capability upgrading and innovation performance: evidence from Latin America","Nuruzzaman, N; Singh, D",2019,10.1108/JKM-07-2018-0447,"Purpose This paper aims to attempt to examine the effect of firm-customer exchange characteristics, frequency and specificity, on the likelihood of the firm to generate customer-driven innovation. The authors draw from social capital theory and argue that repetitive and customer-specific exchange improves the trusts between firm and customers, which in turn ease the flows of tacit knowledge from customers to the firm. From the perspective of customer knowledge management, the authors contribute by examining the mechanism by which a firm can acquire knowledge from and about customers. The authors further argue that a firm's ability to absorb knowledge from customers and turn them into innovation also depends on its internal capability. A firm that consistently upgrades its capacity is more likely to generate customer-driven innovation than those that do not. Also, the authors argue that the joint effect of exchange characteristics and internal capability upgrading can further increase the likelihood of customer-driven innovation. Such a joint force implies the positive moderating effect of internal capability upgrading to the relationship between exchange characteristics and customer-driven innovation. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the hypotheses on 3,000 firms from six countries in Latin America. They take advantage of the 2017 World Bank Enterprises Survey. This most recent of the survey asks questions on various types of innovation and firm-customers exchange characteristics and other firm-level variables. Findings The authors find support for our hypotheses that repeated exchange and exchanges tailored to specific customers have a positive effect on customer-driven innovation. Also, they find the support that internal capability upgrading, in the form of investment in product design, marketing and organizational development has a positive effect on customer-driven innovation. The authors also find that investment in product design positively moderates the impact of exchange characteristics on the likelihood of customer-driven innovation. Originality/value While past studies focus on strategies to acquire and manage customers' knowledge, little has been said about how exchange attributes can encourage or discourage innovation? This question is important because various theoretical perspectives may have a different prediction on the effect of firm-customer relationship and innovation.

Across five experiments, spanning four domains of indulgence-related decisions and relying on different methods of curiosity elicitation, the present research sheds light on an unexpected yet crucial consequence of curiosity-that unsatisfied curiosity tempts indulgent consumption in domains unrelated to the source of the curiosity. This effect is explained by a generalized desire for rewards. Experiments 1-3 establish and replicate the proposed mediation model of curiosity -> desire for rewards -> indulgence, employing manipulation-of-process, moderation-of-process, and measurement-of-process experimental designs. Experiment 4 utilizes neurophysiological data to indicate brain activation in the insular cortex for unsatisfied (vs. satisfied) curiosity. Experiment 5 addresses the role of cognitive depletion as a possible alternative mechanism. In summary, this article demonstrates that the hunger for information that accompanies unsatisfied curiosity is converted into a generalized desire for rewards, which in turn tempts indulgence.",curiosity; desire for rewards; indulgent consumption; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; insula; multimethod mediation,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,wos-prediction
Differences and Similarities between Impulse Buying and Variety Seeking: A Personality-based Perspective,"Olsen, SO; Tudoran, AA; Honkanen, P; Verplanken, B",2016,10.1002/mar.20853,"Although personality is a key determinant of consumer purchasing decision making, the role of personality traits in impulse buying and variety seeking is not conclusive. This research uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among impulse buying tendency (IBT), variety seeking tendency (VST), and the Big Five personality traits within one integrated framework. Based on data from a nationally representative sample of 1644 Norwegian adults, the results show that while IBT and VST might be correlated, they differ significantly with respect to two major personality aspects: neuroticism and openness to experience. Specifically, the present study indicates that neuroticism predicted IBT positively and VST negatively, while openness was a strong predictor of VST and unrelated to IBT.

A note on modeling consumer reactions to a crisis: The case of the mad cow disease,"Pennings, JME; Wansink, B; Meulenberg, MTG",2002,10.1016/S0167-8116(02)00050-2,"What drives the behavior of consumers when faced with a product-related crisis, such as that involving food contamination or life-threatening design flaws? For both consumers and companies, these crises have become of increasing importance because of the globalization of markets and an increased coverage by the media. Marketers need to understand why and how consumers react to a crisis. We show that by decoupling risk response behavior of consumers into the separate components of risk perception and risk attitude, a more robust conceptualization and prediction of consumers' reactions is possible. Such a framework helps provide answers on how marketers can deal with such types of crises. The merits of this conceptualization are illustrated in two field studies that examine the reactions of German, Dutch, and American consumers to the BSE (mad cow disease) crisis.

The red and the black: Mental accounting of savings and debt,"Prelec, D; Loewenstein, G",1998,10.1287/mksc.17.1.4,"In the standard economic account of consumer behavior the cost of a purchase takes the form of a reduction in future utility when expenditures that otherwise could have been made are forgone. The reality of consumer hedonics is different. When people make purchases, they often experience an immediate pain of paying, which can undermine the pleasure derived from consumption. The ticking of the taxi meter, for example, reduces one's pleasure from the ride. We propose a double-entry mental accounting theory that describes the nature of these reciprocal interactions between the pleasure of consumption and the pain of paring and draws out their implications for consumer behavior and hedonics. A central assumption of the model, which we call prospective accounting, is that consumption that has already been paid for can be enjoyed as if it were free and that the pain associated with payments made prior to consumption (but not after) is buffered by thoughts of the benefits that the payments will finance. Another important concept is coupling, which refers to the degree to which consumption calls to mind thoughts of payment, and vice versa. Some financing methods, such as credit cards, tend to weaken coupling, whereas others, such as cash payment, produce tight coupling. Our model makes a variety of predictions that are at variance with economic formulations. Contrary to the standard prediction that people will finance purchases to minimize the present value of payments, our model predicts strong debt aversion-that they should prefer to prepay for consumption or to get paid for work after it is performed. Such pay-before sequences confer hedonic benefits because consumption can be enjoyed without thinking about the need to pay for it in the future. Likewise, when paring beforehand, the pain of paying is mitigated by thoughts of future consumption benefits. Contrary to the economic prediction that consumers should prefer to pay, at the margin, for what they consume, our model predicts that consumers will find it less painful to pay for, and hence will prefer, flat-rate pricing schemes such as unlimited Internet access at a fixed monthly price, even if it involves paying more for the same usage. Other predictions concern spending patterns with cash, charge, or credit cards, and preferences for the earmarking of purchases. We test these predictions in a series of surveys and in a conjoint-like analysis that pitted our double-entry mental accounting model against a standard discounting formulation and another benchmark that did not incorporate hedonic interactions between consumption and payments. Our model provides a better fit of the data for 60% of the subjects; the discounting formulation provides a better fit for only 29% of the subjects (even when allowing for positive and negative discount rates). The pain of paying, we argue, plays an important role in consumer self-regulation, but is hedonically costly. From a hedonic perspective the ideal situation is one in which payments are tightly coupled to consumption (so that paying evokes thoughts about the benefits being financed) but consumption is decoupled from payments (so that consumption does not evoke thoughts about payment). From an efficiency perspective, however, it is important for consumers to be aware of what they are paying for consumption. This creates a tension between hedonic efficiency and what we call decision efficiency. Various institutional arrangements, such as financing of public parks through taxes or usage fees, play into this tradeoff. A producer developing a pricing structure for their product or sen iee should be aware of these two conflicting objectives, and should try to devise a structure that reconciles them.",,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,wos-prediction
Manufacturer's returns policies and retail competition,"Padmanabhan, V; Png, IPL",1997,10.1287/mksc.16.1.81,"Manufacturers' returns policies are a common feature in the distribution of many products. The obvious rationale for returns policies is insurance. Practitioners, not surprisingly, have a different perspective and view returns as a cost of doing business. In this paper, we study the strategic effect of returns policies on retail competition and highlight its profitability implications for a manufacturer. The setting for our research is the distribution of products with uncertain demand, limited shelf lives, and retail competition. Our objective is to provide a better understanding of when manufacturers should adopt returns policies. The insights are obtained with a model based on the economics of strategy and decision making under uncertainty. We show that when retailing is competitive and there is no uncertainty in demand, a returns policy subtly induces retailers to compete more intensely. The provision of a returns policy reduces retail prices without affecting wholesale prices, thereby reducing retailer margins and improving manufacturer profitability. The intuition is that with a returns policy, Cournot-like levels of retail stocks cannot be sustained. Each retailer will order stocks so that it will not be constrained by stocks, and so, intensifying retail competition. When, however, demand is uncertain and there is a single retailer, a returns policy encourages the retailer to over-stock, and so decreases (upstream) manufacturer profits. While the provision of a returns policy leads to lower retail margins, the optimality of returns policy depends on the overall uncertainty and marginal cost. A returns policy reduces the dispersion in retail prices between the high and low states of demand and the range of retail prices in the returns case is contained within the range of retail prices for the no-returns case. In the general setting, when there are competing retailers and demand is uncertain, there is a trade-off for the manufacturer between the benefits (more intense retail competition) and the costs (excessive stocking) of a returns policy. We find that a manufacturer should accept returns when the marginal production cost is sufficiently low and demand uncertainty is not too great. To validate the results of our theory, we conduct an empirical test with data from a major U.S. retailer. The tests confirm our prediction that a returns policy intensifies retail competition and reduces retailer margins. Our theory and empirical test should interest practitioners and researchers in distribution, especially those concerned with managing retail competition.",,INFORMS,wos-prediction
A business sustainability model: a European case study,"Hogevold, NM; Svensson, G",2012,10.1108/08858621211197001,"Purpose-Business sustainability refers to the total effort of a company including its demand and supply chain networks to reduce the impact on the Earth's life-and eco-systems. The objective of this paper is to describe a business sustainability model based upon a case study of a European manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was applied describing the efforts of business sustainability in the demand and supply chain networks of a Norwegian office chair producer. It is based upon a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews with top executives of the company as well as observations and content analyses of internal and external documents about the company's efforts of business sustainability. Findings-The case study shows that business sustainability is not about doing just one thing, but that a multitude of simultaneous efforts (e.g. actors, resources and activities) should be in place. Furthermore, business sustainability is not only about a company's own business operations, but its whole demand and supply chain networks which need to be included and taken into consideration. Research limitations/implications-The case study in focus is limited to just one company's effort of business sustainability and its demand and supply chain networks. It provides a business sustainability model that offers opportunities for further research. Practical implications-Focusing on the corporate impact of the natural environment can be highly profitable. Business sustainability and by extension the carbon footprint of demand and supply chain networks is becoming a criterion in the decision-making process of customers across industries. Business sustainability is a concern to everybody in society as the indicatives of climate change and global warming become more evident and troublesome. No one can have missed the fact that the weather is becoming more extreme, causing damage around the globe. Originality/value-The authors argue that research into business sustainability needs at this stage of development to be inductive rather than deductive it may be an irreversible mistake to try to re-package existing theory into business sustainability, as climate change prediction and the poor condition of the Earth have not been fully understood or comprised in previous theory.",Business model; Business sustainability; Carbon footprint; Network; Demand chain; Supply chain; Norway; Supply and demand,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-prediction
Local food sales and point of sale priming: evidence from a supermarket field experiment,"Brecic, R; Coric, DS; Lucic, A; Gorton, M; Filipovic, J",2021,10.1108/EJM-07-2019-0604,"Purpose An intention-behavior gap often occurs for socially responsible consumption, where despite positive consumer attitudes, sales remain disappointing. This paper aims to test the ability of in-store priming to increase sales of local foods vis-a-vis imported, cheaper equivalents. Design/methodology/approach Laboratory and field experiments in three countries (Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia), working with an international grocery retailer, assess the ability of textual and pictorial-based point of sale (PoS) materials to increase the purchase of local foods. Field sales data, for the purchase of local apples and cherries and their imported equivalents, are complemented by an analysis of loyalty card transactions. Findings Field data indicate that both pictorial and textual PoS materials, significantly increase the likelihood of purchasing local foods, against cheaper imported equivalents. Pictorial PoS materials appear more effective than textual equivalents. Laboratory study data indicate that PoS materials increase the salience of goal consistent mechanisms in decision-making at the expense of mechanisms to achieve non-primed goals. Research limitations/implications The field experiment lasted for only two weeks and focused on seasonal produce. Practical implications PoS materials offer a low cost intervention for modifying consumer behavior in stores. Originality/value The paper develops a theory regarding how priming works and its application in a supermarket setting. This is investigated and validated in the context of local foods. The study offers encouragement for the usefulness of other in-store primes, such as relating to diet, to improve socially desirable outcomes without economic incentives or coercion and in a cost-effective manner.",Supermarkets; Field experiment; Priming; Local foods,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-prediction

Brand loyalty has fascinated a number of researchers to conduct studies for so many years; however, its relationship with future anticipation has remained untouched by academia. Design/methodology/approach This study proved the proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. The empirical approximated for the main-effects model and model goodness of fit indexes. The results signified a good fit of the data to our conceptual model in both samples. Findings The research shows that the influence of future anticipation is very essential in creating a brand relationship, autobiographical memory or even market performance and all in Asia; also Europe has similar significance with regard to this matter. Thus, it is important for companies to emphasize the importance of future anticipation and also delivers or informs it well to customers to create a positive perception in customers' mind. Originality/value Future anticipation concept is anchored in philosophy theory and psychology. With respect to the study objectives, the focus is on the perspective of time which refers to thought and attitude toward past, present and future. In exploring what kind of behavior is related with future, the authors views are based on the futurology, a concept from sociology that studies generalizations about the nature of prediction.

A longitudinal study of franchisor failure according to Altman's Z model,"Rodríguez-Rad, CJ; Rondán-Cataluña, FJ; Macías-Molina, JA",2017,10.1080/1051712X.2018.1381416,"Purpose: The foremost objective of this study is to obtain segments/clusters of franchisors that are more likely to fail. A second aim is to evaluate the influence of the usual variables of the franchise contract on the solvency of franchises. Design/methodology/approach: This study set up a database with information collected from several Spanish franchising yearbooks and franchisors' websites to establish the census of Spanish franchisors. This article worked with a census of the franchises operating in Spain from 2001 to 2011. Latent class regression analysis is used. Findings: This research found four segments or classes of franchisors with regard to their failure pattern. In addition, this article defined the most influential variables in the franchisors' risk of failure. The relationships between the variables that define a franchise contract and the Z scores of Altman's model have been extracted. The dependent variable has been the Altman's Z model and the independent variables are those that define the franchise contract. Research implications: This methodology offers potential franchisees a new criterion for assessing the franchise chains they are investigating, taking into account their risk of failure. This allows franchisees to better highlight those franchisors that have a lower crash risk and avoid the damage incurred by the closure of the chain. The information provided for franchisees should be accessible, usable, and suitable to help franchisees to choose the best franchise systems in which to invest. This methodology is of course very useful for franchisors, because they can comprehend their financial situation and how they could manage the franchising variables in order to improve their solvency. Practical implications: All the segments are solvent, except Segment 3. The distinguishing feature of this segment is that over 64 percent of the firms are retailer chains. In addition, more than 20 percent of the franchises from our database are in financial danger, and this is the group where the number of service companies is lower. Originality/value: This research is unique in two ways. First, this study presents a new methodology in this field that allows researchers to use the historical-financial data of franchisors, and the information of the franchise contract to predict franchisor failure. Second, this article helps franchisees to make their own decisions on the basis of the franchisors' level of risk of failure. Third, this research offer a theoretical contribution about franchisor failure, this topic is scarcely treated by academic literature.",Franchising; franchisor; failure; latent class regression; Altman's Z Model,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-prediction
Contextual influences on judgment based on limited information,"Sanbonmatsu, DM; Kardes, FR; Posavac, SS; Houghton, DC",1997,10.1006/obhd.1997.2686,"When judging objects described by incomplete evidence, people often make judgments on the basis of what is known and fail to adjust for what is unknown. However, contextual factors may increase sensitivity to the limited weight of the given information. Consistent with this hypothesis, four experiments show that sensitivity to the limitations of the evidence and the likelihood of judgmental moderation increases when (a) a target is judged in the context of a similar object described on dimensions different from those used to describe the target, or (b) a target is judged in the context of a completely different type of object described by a relatively large amount of information. Considered together, the results suggest that judgment is moderated when contextual objects or cues alert judges to specific omissions or when contextual cues imply a general lack of information. The findings illuminate the diverse effects that even context objects of a different category have on information integration judgment. Context objects may affect the weighting as well as the valuation of the evidence about targets described by limited information and thereby contribute to judgmental moderation. Finally, the findings illustrate the contextually sensitive nature of the weighting criteria that guide information integration.

Task-Dependent Algorithm Aversion,"Castelo, N; Bos, MW; Lehmann, DR",2019,10.1177/0022243719851788,"Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task's perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms' perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.",algorithms; new products; technology adoption,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-prediction

This study explored the effects of six variables derived from the theory of planned behaviour, ethics theory, and deterrence theory on young consumers in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach - Using a convenience sampling approach, researchers hand delivered 400 questionnaires to undergraduate students at one large private university and one major public university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Findings - The results showed that consumers' intention to pirate digital products was strongly influenced by consumers' attitude towards digital piracy. Interestingly, fear of legal consequences and perceived likelihood of punishment were not significant predictors of consumers' attitude towards digital piracy. This suggests that the principles of deterrence theory have a limited impact on consumers' attitudes in Indonesia.

Recommendation systems with purchase data,"Bodapati, AV",2008,10.1509/jmkr.45.1.77,"Many firms use decision tools called automatic recommendation systems that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data.

Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this model-based recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%.

Findings - Results of two online experiments showed that when consumers used RAs, low search led to better decision quality, whereas when consumers did not use RAs, medium search led to optimum decision quality. When consumers use RAs, SK had a U-shaped influence on the decision quality indicating that decision quality was the lowest for those with medium SK. When consumers did not use RAs, the effect of SK on decision quality was an inverted U-shape, indicating optimum decision quality for medium SK consumers. When consumers did not use RAs, subjects with high involvement made better choices, whereas when consumers used RAs, low involvement subjects made better choices. However, subjects who searched more had higher decision confidence and decision satisfaction even if their choices were not better.

A possibilistic-valued multi-criteria decision-making support for marketing activities in e-commerce: Feedback Based Diagnosis System,"Denguir-Rekik, A; Montmain, J; Mauris, G",2009,10.1016/j.ejor.2007.11.020,"In this paper we propose a mufti-criteria decision making support system, called a Feedback Based Diagnosis System (FBDS), to aid the marketing team of an e-commerce (EC) organisation in its activities. The FBDS database is composed of customers' satisfaction measures. These measures are related to the different services an EC offers to its customers. Thus, they constitute a mufti-criteria (MC) evaluation of EC performances. In the general framework of recommender systems, these available MC evaluations are considered as useful information for other customers to help them to objectively, rationally and exhaustively assess and compare the numerous ECs among the ones likely to meet their needs. Our FBDS is not concerned with improving or automating such a recommendation process for customers. Indeed, it is merely EC management team oriented. In fact, the MC feedback database is used to diagnose the EC health and improve its strategy. In the proposed FBDS, a possibilistic framework is combined with the multi criteria representation to capture the variability and the divergence of customers' evaluations w.r.t. each criterion. Then, an aggregation based on a weighted arithmetic mean (WAM) is proposed to obtain a synthetic appraisal of ECs. The WAM aggregation models the strategy agreed on by the EC management team. Computing the synthesis score of an EC consists in propagating the uncertainty related to its partial scores through the WAM. The possibilistic representation guarantees that no information is lost in the collective evaluation process by the consumers' community. However, diagnosis indicators are finally proposed to the marketing team to make the interpretation of some possibilistic results more comprehensive when necessary. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Consumer participation in online product recommendation services: augmenting the technology acceptance model,"Sheng, XJ; Zolfagharian, M",2014,10.1108/JSM-04-2013-0098,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the complex role of consumer participation by empirically testing a theoretical model within the online context of consumer using product recommendation agents (RAs) that integrates consumer participation into the technology acceptance model (TAM). Recent research starts questioning whether consumer participation is a double-edged sword, although its positive effects have been widely documented in the services marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 243 respondents comprising both genders with varied age groups, education levels, household income and ethnicities. Participants interacted with an existing RA, searching product information for a simulated purchase involving either high or low financial risk. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural equations modeling (SEM) were used for assessing construct validity and testing hypotheses, respectively. Findings - Consumer participation was found to positively affect enjoyment but negatively affect perceived ease of use of an RA, which was exacerbated when the purchase was of high financial risk. Predictions based on TAM were all supported in this study. Research limitations/implications - This research evidenced consumer participation's dual-effect and identified financial risk as a moderator of consumer participation' negative effect.

Recommendation Influence: Differential Neural Responses of Consumers During Shopping Online,"Guo, F; Zhang, XF; Ding, Y; Wang, XS",2016,10.1037/npe0000051,"In diverse social environments, recommendations from others have the power to change consumer behavior. In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from high-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing.",recommendation; neural responses; event-related potentials; propensity; value measurement,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,wos-recommendation
Personalized digital marketing recommender engine,"Behera, RK; Gunasekaran, A; Gupta, S; Kamboj, S; Bala, PK",2020,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.03.026,"E-business leverages digital channels to scale its functions and services and operates by connecting and retaining customers using marketing initiatives. To increase the likelihood of a sale, the business must recommend additional items that the customers may be unaware of or may find appealing. Recommender Engine (RE) is considered to be the preferred solution in these cases for reasons that include delivering relevant items, hence improving cart value, and boosting customer engagement. The paper describes a model for delivering real-time, personalised marketing information concerning the recommended items for online and offline customers, using a blend of selling strategies: up-selling, cross-selling, best-in-class-selling, needs-satisfaction-selling and consultative-selling. The model further defines the e-marketplace by clustering items, customers and unique selling proposition (USP), and then gathering, storing, and processing transactional data, and displaying personalised marketing information to support the customer in their decision-making process, even when purchasing from large item spaces. An experimental study using a quantitative research methodology was conducted in a mid-size healthcare retailer, based out of India, to determine the tangible benefits. The model was tested with 100 online customers and, with the adoption of the proposed methodology, the results indicated growth in average monthly revenue (33.49%), Average Order Value (AOV) (32.79%) and Items per Order (IPO) (1.93%).",Personalized digital marketing; Recommender engine; Customer relationship management,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,wos-recommendation

Recommend or not: A comparative analysis of customer reviews to uncover factors influencing explicit online recommendation behavior in peer-to-peer accommodation,"Ding, K; Gong, XY; Huang, T; Choo, WC",2024,10.1016/j.iedeen.2023.100236,"In the fiercely competitive landscape of the peer-to-peer accommodation platform Airbnb, understanding customers' online recommendation behavior is essential for optimizing competitiveness and harnessing the potential of electronic word-of-mouth. This study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the factors driving customers' issuance of positive or negative recommendations based on their experiences. Leveraging 10,101 online reviews from Airbnb users, we employ the Structural Topic Model to determine latent topics relating to customers' recommendation intentions. This study reveals that positive recommendations are primarily influenced by hedonic values tied to the overall experience, including crucial aspects such as convenience for exploring points of interest, local authenticity, social interaction, and emotional fulfillment. These findings highlight the significance of providing memorable and enriching experiences to elicit positive reviews from customers. On the other hand, negative recommendations are closely linked to utilitarian values focused on practical concerns such as check -in procedures, cleanliness, comfortableness, and amenities. Understanding these utilitarian factors is vital for hosts and platform administrators to improve service quality and address potential issues that may lead to negative reviews. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the significant role of hosts in shaping both positive and negative recommendations.

Standing up for or against: A text-mining study on the recommendation of mobile payment apps,"Verkijika, SF; Neneh, BN",2021,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102743,"Mobile payment systems offer enormous potential as alternative payment solutions. However, the diffusion of mobile payments over the years has been less than optimal despite the numerous studies that have explored the reasons for its adoption. Consequently, there is an increased interest in exploring alternative actions for promoting its diffusion, especially user recommendation of the technology. This is because positive recommendations can enormously influence the decisions of potential consumers to use the technology while negative recommendations can increase resistance to it. The few extant studies in this domain have followed the traditional survey approach with hypothetic-deductive reasoning, thus limiting an understanding of factors outside their conceptual models that could influence recommendations. To address this shortcoming, this study uses a qualitative text-mining approach that explores themes from user reviews of mobile payment applications (apps). Using 5955 reviews from 16 mobile payment apps hosted on the Google Play store, this study applied the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) text-mining method to extract themes from the reviews that help to explain why users provide positive or negative recommendations about mobile payment systems. A total of 13 themes (i.e. ease of use, usefulness, convenience, security, reliability, satisfaction, transaction speed, time-saving, customer support, output quality, perceived cost, usability and trust) were generated from the LDA model which provides both theoretical and practical insights for advancing mobile payments diffusion and research.",Mobile payment; Text-mining; Positive recommendation; Negative recommendation,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,wos-recommendation

The recommendation technique uses general consumer perception about product attributes of multiattributed products such as smartphones as input and gives consumers' sequential preference of the products as output. The recommendation technique explains the power of an attribute in predicting other attributes, especially in fuzzy and uncertain environments, through the conceptualisation of consumers' innate associations between the attributes. Our technique provides an understanding of consumer preference through the articulation of buyers' trade-offs amongst attributes of a product. (c) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

A fundamental solution to this issue is how to accurately and comprehensively model user interest. To resolve such a significant and challenging task, our study constructed a user interest graph represented by a hierarchical tree structure that covers a wide range of topics, from coarse-grained to fine-grained three-level interest topics, such as food, entertainment and shopping, with a total of 167 nodes. In addition, considering that a user's interests are always changing over time, an exponential interest decay scheme is employed in this study. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model by comparing it with three benchmarks designed based on the proposed algorithm and two similar hierarchical user interest models. The experimental results demonstrate our model works well to predict user interests.

Bias-driven marketing that instigates pledging to a crowdfunding campaign: An experimental consideration of behavioral anomalies,"Panneerselvam, T; Arun, CJ",2022,10.1111/ijcs.12795,"Bias-driven marketing leverages the behavioral biases of investors for greater marketing gains. To transform cognitively biased individuals from antagonists into allies, the marketers need to decipher the critical crowdfunding attributes, which ultimately motivate behaviorally biased crowdfunders to invest in crowdfunding campaigns. Hence, this study seeks to investigate the influential factors concerning four behavioral biases that accelerate crowdfunding adoption. A conceptual model, parameterized using conjoint analysis, is developed and administered in an agent-based behavior model to effectively determine the influential crowdfunding attributes, which will induce the biased investors to adopt crowdfunding. The results revealed that status quo biased individuals adopted the crowdfunding campaign when launched by well-known and reputed fund raisers. Whereas, hyperbolic discounting bias accelerated the adoption when the campaign reached more than 75% of subscription and duration was lesser than 30 days. The results also indicated that framing bias enhanced the adoption when the risk inherent in the project is disclosed. Finally, the results also claimed that individuals liable to loss aversion bias expected a known funder, who posts frequent updates and preferred the All-or-Nothing crowdfunding model. The experimental results of the study provide insights to the marketers that crowdfunding campaigns can be successfully strategized through the exploration of underlying cognitive biases and the corresponding motivational cues that accentuate the pledging behavior of the funders. Given the importance of an effective marketing strategy in crowdfunding adoption, this study offers one such recommendation to the crowdfunding campaigners by demonstrating how bias driven marketing strategy enhances the adoption rate of the campaigns. With the strong pieces of evidence obtained from this study, it is anticipated that behavioral biases, drawn from the neuromarketing theory, will no longer be viewed as cognitive errors from the investor's perspective. Rather, it will be viewed as a boon from the marketer's perspective as the bias-based marketing strategies have the potential to achieve a fully subscribed crowdfunding campaign.",agent based behavior model; behavioral bias; bias driven marketing; crowdfunding adoption; modeling biased funders,WILEY,wos-recommendation

In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context.

For both, these effects are due to a sense of social empowerment, which also stimulates recommenders' desire for a product and positive behavioral intentions. However, recommenders' communication motives impose boundary conditions.

Consumer decision making in online shopping environments:: The effects of interactive decision aids,"Häubl, G; Trifts, V",2000,10.1287/mksc.19.1.4.15178,"Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aims for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives x attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making In particular, rye focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality RA the efficiency of purchase decisions-shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort, This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.",,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,wos-recommendation

The authors used partial least squares technique to analyze the model. Findings Recommendation trust and positive utilities (economic benefits and perceived enjoyment) positively affect the intention of mobile coupon redemption. Perceived risk, as a negative utility, negatively influences coupon redemption intention. In addition, swift trust (structure assurance, perceived similarity, trust propensity, and expertise of the recommender), knowledge-based trust (familiarity with the retailers), and emotion-based trust (social tie strength) are key drivers that promote recommendation trust.

In this paper, we report on an empirical study which considered the problem of designing a university and involved more than 300 respondents. Because of this large-scale design, we performed a paper-and-pencil investigation and selected methods which could concisely be applied in such a setting: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the conjoint analysis (CA). The results show that both methods give useful models of the respondents' preferences. However, inspecting the utility functions determined in detail reveals considerable discrepancies between them. Most of the measures used for comparison indicate AHP to be the better choice for the special decision situation considered. In order to get a more general recommendation, we categorize different types of MADP and discuss the applicability of AHP and CA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive and more undesirable role from the perspectives of both the recommending agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.",recommendations; intelligent agents; decision support systems; internet marketing,INFORMS,wos-recommendation
The Effect of Expertise on Consumers' Satisfaction with the Use of Interactive Recommendation Agents,"Su, HJ; Comer, LB; Lee, S",2008,10.1002/mar.20244,"Based on cost-benefit theory and the value-percept diversity model, this study investigates the underlying mechanism that makes consumers feel satisfied with the use of interactive recommendation agents (IRAs). The format of IRAs was manipulated experimentally (attribute-based format/benefit-based format/no agent) and participants were classified as either expert or novice consumers. The dependent measures were the perceived costs and benefits of the information search process, the perceived costs and benefits of the decision-making process, and the degree of satisfaction with the outcome. The results explain the mechanisms underlying consumers' satisfaction when using an IRA. The findings also suggest the presence of an interaction between the expertise of consumers and the preferred type of IRA on various dependent variables.

Determinants of retail bank choice in Nigeria: a focus on gender-based choice decisions,"Omar, OE",2008,10.1007/s11628-008-0039-1,"As the Nigerian retail banks customers become more sophisticated, it is now very important that retail banks determine the factors that are important and relevant to the customers' retail bank choice decisions. By using a survey of retail bank customers, this study evaluates the relative importance attached to retail banks' choice criteria used by male and female customers in Nigeria. The results show that there are some differences in choice factors used by male and female customers in selecting a retail bank for patronage. The recommendation is that bank managers should take both female and male market segments into consideration when making retail bank strategic planning in order to become competitive. The findings can assist retail bank managers in refining their marketing strategies as a means of overcoming the intense competition that exists in the Nigerian banking system.",Nigerian bank customers; Male and female customers; Retail banking; Choice of retail banks,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,wos-recommendation
Consumer self-construal and trust as determinants of the reactance to a recommender advice,"Aljukhadar, M; Trifts, V; Senecal, S",2017,10.1002/mar.21017,"Commercial recommendation agents (RAs) represent an important type of the decision support systems (DSSs) that are widely used by online retailers and firms. To date, little is known about the factors that shape the user's decision making and reactance toward the recommendations of these agents. Building on theories from psychology and information systems domains, this research proposes that a user's self-construal and trust are two relevant factors that interact to shape the behavior toward the RA advice. Two studies, the first conducted using potential online customers and the second conducted at a behavioral laboratory, provided support to this proposition. The first study considered RA trust and showed that activating the interdependent self leads users with low (high) trust to exhibit high reactance behavior toward the RA advice. The second study variated trust using trust cues and corroborated the latter finding, while showing no important impact for the psychological reactance trait. As expected, in both studies the reactance behavior of independent users was not affected by trust. These results contribute by underscoring that social interdependence extends to RAs because the role of trust becomes salient when the interdependent self is activated for a user.",decision making; DSS impact; reactance behavior; recommendation agents; self-construal; trust,WILEY,wos-recommendation
Consumer Decision Making on the Web: A Theoretical Analysis and Research Guidelines,"Punj, G",2012,10.1002/mar.20564,"Recent empirical data on online shopping suggests that consumers have the potential to make better quality decisions while shopping on the web. But whether such potential is being realized by most consumers is an unresolved matter. Hence, the purpose of this research is to understand how (1) certain features of electronic environments have a favorable effect on the abilities of consumers to make better decisions, and (2) identify information-processing strategies that would enable consumers to make better quality decisions while shopping online. A cross-disciplinary theoretical analysis based on constructs drawn from economics (e.g., time costs), computing (e.g., recommendation agents), and psychology (e.g., decision strategies) is conducted to identify factors that potentially influence decision quality in electronic environments. The research is important from a theoretical standpoint because it examines an important aspect of online consumer decision making, namely, the impact of the electronic environment on the capabilities of consumers. It is important from both a managerial and public policy standpoint because the ability of shoppers to make better quality decisions while shopping online is directly related to improving market efficiency and enhancing consumer welfare in electronic markets.",,WILEY,wos-recommendation
The Impact of Social Networking Sites on Luxury Vehicles Purchase Decision Process in Gulf Cooperation Council Countries,"Al-Abdallah, G; Khair, N; Elmarakby, R",2021,10.1080/08961530.2020.1867023,"Social networking sites are becoming an essential part of consumer daily activities, with profound changes in purchasing behavior compared to traditional buying formats. This study investigates the possible impact of social networking sites on the purchasing decision process concerning luxury vehicles in one of the most important markets for such products, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The study also investigates the possible impact of relative demographics on the direct relationship between social networking sites (independent variable) and the purchase decision process (dependent variable) of luxury vehicles. In order to achieve this aim, a descriptive analytical methodology is utilized with quantitative survey strategy, with a five-point Likert-type questionnaire. Of 1,500 personally submitted questionnaires distributed over a non-probability quota sample to the main showrooms and dealerships in the GCC, 1,257 were retrieved (a response rate of 83.8%); after the filtration and screening process, 1,224 valid questionnaire forms were statistically analyzed. The results indicate that social networking sites have a significant positive direct impact on the purchasing decision process of luxury vehicles in the examined population, with the highest impact being for the first two stages of the process (need recognition and information search). As for the moderation effect of relative demographics, only income and time daily time spent on social media had positive significant moderating effects on the direct relationship between social networking sites and purchasing decision process, while education had a negative significant effect. The results also indicated particular roles of certain social networking sites, like YouTube, and the fact that females prefer Snapchat over other digital platforms.

In a laboratory study (Study 1), we found that regulatory fit increase consumers' click-through behaviors of new product recommendations. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 in a controlled online experiment and found support for regulatory fit-click-through intentions relationship. Study 3 found that regulatory fit increases click-through intentions for new products but not for existing products. Study 4 supported the mediating role of perceived efficacy and boundary condition of consumer innovativeness in the relationship between regulatory fit and click-through intentions.

Product set granularity and consumer response to recommendations,"Tsekouras, D; Dellaert, BGC; Donkers, B; Häubl, G",2020,10.1007/s11747-019-00682-6,"Many consumer decisions are assisted by product recommendations. When retailers provide such recommendations, there is an inherent tension between (1) presenting a set of products that are close in attractiveness (fine product set granularity) and (2) presenting a wider range of products that are more different in attractiveness (coarse product set granularity). While the former can maximize the attractiveness of the recommended set of products, the latter makes it easier for consumers to determine which of the recommended products is most attractive, thus boosting consumer response. Evidence from a large-scale field study (with naturally occurring variation in the granularity of online recommendation sets) provides strong support for this tension and shows that less fine-grained product recommendation sets promote consumer response. We also find that, in line with our theorizing, coarser set granularity increases the time consumers spend processing detailed information about individual products relative to time they spend comparing products at the set level. These effects are less pronounced when consumer engagement in the decision process is low. The key insights from the field study are replicated in a tightly controlled experiment (using a different product domain). The findings of this research have important implications for how best to integrate large online assortments and product recommendations to stimulate consumer response.",Product recommendations; Product set granularity; Online assortments; Consumer response; Consumer decision-making,SPRINGER,wos-recommendation

Based on key informant literature we discuss the difficulties of gaining reliable information from respondents and we identify potential sources for heterogeneous perceptions among different respondents. We assume that NPD research may be subject to response biases, if it is based on sole informants only. We apply an existing benchmarking approach for NPD processes in a comprehensive case study in order to illustrate sources and effects of single informant biases We find that perceptions differ substantially among the individual respondents. In particular, we observe different functional perceptions between respondents from Marketing and Research and Development. The results are consistent with expectations from interface theory, these perceptual differences have a severe impact on the managerial conclusions drawn from benchmarking. There appears to be no single reliable source of information within an organization. Furthermore, variances among informants' assessments should be recognized and regarded as valuable information. It is our recommendation that multiple informants ought to be included in future NPD research and benchmarking studies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Competing for Recommendations: The Strategic Impact of Personalized Product Recommendations in Online Marketplaces,"Zhou, B; Zou, TX",2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1388,"We study how an online marketplace's personalized product recommendations and its consumer profiling accuracy affect third-party sellers' competition and the market outcomes. Sellers strategically adjust prices to compete for the marketplace's recommendations. As the marketplace more accurately predicts consumers' preferences, the equilibrium price first decreases and then increases, and both the marketplace's and the sellers' profits may decrease despite the improved recommendation accuracy. Moreover, recommending the most profitable product for each recommendation may reduce profits of the marketplace and the sellers, and the marketplace can benefit from excluding pricing information in its recommendation decisions to prevent sellers' recommendation competition. Counterintuitively, regulations that bar recommendations from considering profit margin information can lead to higher prices and thus harm consumers. These results are driven by competing sellers' three distinctive incentives: competing for recommendations, exploiting targeted consumers, and undercutting rivals' prices. We also find that our key insights remain qualitatively unchanged if the marketplace recommends products based on consumer surplus, and the equilibrium price will be lower in comparison. Finally, various extensions demonstrate the robustness of these results.",online marketplace; personalization; recommendation system; platform bias; retail platform; platform regulation; search engine optimization,INFORMS,wos-recommendation
Ranking of choice cues for smartphones using the Best-Worst scaling method,"Pinto, L; Kaynak, E; Chow, CSF; Zhang, LDL",2019,10.1108/APJML-01-2018-0004,"Purpose The number of studies on the use of choice cues in the purchase decision of a smartphone does not appear to be extensive, given the size and rate of growth of the market. Surprisingly, it appears that no study of this type in the Chinese context has been undertaken. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach Best-Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important.

Based on the information gathered through a questionnaire with a sample of 190 international students studying at a Portuguese HEI, a quantitative, cross-sectional and causal study was conducted using the estimation of a structural equation model calculated through PLS, in order to investigate the impact of choice factors and information sources on international students' loyalty, mediated by satisfaction with the choice made. The findings indicate that the choice factors with the greatest impact on satisfaction of the international students were: the perception of the country, the environment and location of the HEI, and the sources of information provided by the HEI. It was also concluded that a positive global perception of the HEI influences the recommendation from significant others, and increases the satisfaction and loyalty of all the international students.

How Customer Referral Programs Turn Social Capital into Economic Capital,"Van den Bulte, C; Bayer, E; Skiera, B; Schmitt, P",2018,10.1509/jmr.14.0653,"Customers acquired through a referral program have been observed to exhibit higher margins and lower churn than customers acquired through other means. Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program. Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer-referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.",customer referral programs; customer relationship marketing; referral marketing; social networks; word-of-mouth marketing,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,wos-recommendation
Effects of Social and Temporal Distance on Consumers' Responses to Peer Recommendations,"Zhao, M; Xie, JH",2011,10.1509/jmkr.48.3.486,"This article examines the interplay of social and temporal distance on consumers' responses to others' recommendations. Drawing on research on psychological distance and the fit literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. Instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance.

Ads are watching me A view from the interplay between anthropomorphism and customisation,"Puzakova, M; Rocereto, JF; Kwak, H",2013,10.2501/IJA-32-4-513-538,"With the advancement of technological platforms, the use of recommendation agents that can provide highly customisable solutions has become more ubiquitous. Marketing academics and practitioners alike have begun to investigate various communication styles and functionality designs of such decision aid systems. One variant of a design of a recommendation agent is to imbue it with humanlike features (i.e. to anthropomorphise it). However, academic research is silent with respect to whether this type of design would lead to more favourable consumer evaluations. To fill this gap, our research investigates the downstream consequences of anthropomorphising a recommendation agent, when the recommendation itself may require the exchange of personally sensitive information, and the message is customised. The results of two experiments reveal that, when a message is customised, the effect of an anthropomorphised recommendation agent on attitude towards the advertisement is predominantly negative and is mediated by consumers' unwillingness to provide personal information to an anthropomorphic recommendation agent, as well as by greater psychological resistance towards the advertisement. Our research concludes with theoretical and practical implications, as well as further research directions.",,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-recommendation
Complaint or recommendation? The impact of customers' state and trait goal orientations on customer engagement behaviors,"Chen, XX; Yu, HY; Gentry, JW; Yu, F",2017,10.1002/cb.1629,"The importance of customer engagement behaviors (CEBs) has been widely acknowledged in marketing. CEB encompasses an interactive relationship with the engaged object. A customer's personality characteristics play an important role in the interactive process. So it is necessary to examine how customer's personality characteristics influence customer engagement behaviors. However, there has been relatively less empirical research examining the impact of a customer's personality characteristics on CEBs. Customer goal orientation (promotion orientation vs. prevention orientation) is one such important personality characteristic. This research examined how customer goal orientation influenced CEBs. We used a priming technique to examine the relationships between the customer's state goal orientation and the customer's recommendations and complaints in study 1. The results showed that customers with state promotion-focused goal orientations initiated more recommendations than the customers with state prevention-focused goal orientations. For complaints, the difference between these two groups was not significant. Study 2 investigated the impact of trait goal orientation on the customer's recommendations and complaints. The results showed that the trait promotion-focused goal orientation customers were more likely to initiate both recommendations and complaints behaviors than the trait prevention-focused goal orientation customers. The findings of the research demonstrate that customer goal orientation is an important influence on positive and negative CEBs, and state and trait goal orientations have different impacts on CEBs. This research helps companies aiming to improve their customers' CEBs by suggesting which type of customers (in terms of goal orientation) are more likely to engage.

Analysis of an industrial component commonality problem,"Jans, R; Degraeve, Z; Schepens, L",2008,10.1016/j.ejor.2007.01.008,"We discuss a case study of an industrial production-marketing coordination problem involving component commonality. For the product line considered, the strategic goal of the company is to move from the current low volume market to a high volume market. The marketing department believes that this can be achieved by substantially lowering the end products' prices. However, this requires a product redesign to lower production costs in order to maintain profit margins. The redesign decision involves grouping end products into families. All products within one family use the same version of some components. This paper fits in the stream of recent literature on component commonality where the focus has shifted from inventory cost savings to production and development cost savings. Further, we consider both costs and revenues, leading to a profit maximization approach. The price elasticity of demand determines the relationship between the price level and number of units sold. Consequently, we integrate information from different functional areas such as production, marketing and accounting. We formulate the problem as a net-present-value investment decision. We propose a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model to find the optimal commonality decision. The recommendation based on our analysis has been implemented in the company. In addition, the application allows us to experimentally validate some claims made in the literature and obtain managerial insights into the trade-offs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the Pension Builder, and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer-online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.

Regulatory focus and investment advisers' recommending behavior,"Ewe, SY; Lee, CKC; Gul, FA",2021,10.1108/IJBM-12-2019-0452,"Purpose This study examines the effect of a regulatory-focused prime (i.e. a brochure with a picture and message) on the recommending behavior of investment advisers in the context of an investment decision. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were conducted with 468 participants, mostly from the financial services industry. Study 1 examined the direct effect of a regulatory-focused prime on an investment adviser's recommending behavior, whereas Study 2 examined the moderating role of regulatory fit on such behavior. Study 3 validated the findings. Findings The results provide evidence that a message using visual and textual cues based on a promotion and prevention regulatory focus may trigger a preference in an investment adviser's product recommendation. A promotion (prevention)-focused framed message will trigger the recommendation of an investment plan with a higher but riskier (safe and stable) potential return. However, when the same prime is presented with details of a performance incentive scheme, the effect of the prime is reduced when there is a regulatory nonfit between the prime and the message relating to the performance incentive scheme. Practical implications The findings highlight the importance of understanding how regulatory-focused stimuli may subconsciously influence the recommendation of investment advisers as heuristics used in decision-making, thereby influencing their clients' investment decisions. Originality/value Past studies have focused on how regulatory-focused visual and message cues influence consumer decision-making.

The evaluations in terms of accuracy, diversity, computation time, and trade-offs among these metrics reveal that the best-performing algorithm in terms of accuracy remains consistent regardless of the input-data characteristics. However, for diversity and computation time, the best-performing model varies with the input characteristics. This framework allows e-commerce companies to decide on the optimal CF configuration as a function of their specific binary purchase data sets. They also gain insight into the impact of changes in the input data set on the preferred algorithm configuration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Social commerce and buying intention post COVID-19: Evidence from a hybrid approach based on SEM - fsQCA,"Elshaer, IA; Alrawad, M; Lutfi, A; Azazz, AMS",2024,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103548,"In the post COVID-19 era, social commerce witnessed significant growth due to increasing numbers of consumers choosing online channels as their preferred means of shopping. Consumer attitude and trust are key factors influencing customers purchase decision of buying products and services marketed through online platforms such as social commerce. A positive consumer attitude towards a brand or product can lead to greater level of perceived trust and, hence, increase the likelihood of purchasing. Further, a negative consumer attitude or low trust may deter individuals from purchasing, even if they are interested in the product. This study aims at investigating the mediating role of customers attitude and perceived trust on the relationship the relationship between social commerce and buying intention post-COVID-19 pandemic. Using a full-structured questionnaire directed to 570 e-commerce consumers, the obtained data were analyzed by hybrid approach based on PLS-SEM and fsQCA.

Activist engagement and industry-level change: Adoption of new practices by observing firms,"Taylor, KM; Hajmohammad, S; Vachon, S",2021,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.007,"Activists strive to create industry-level change and institutionalize socially and environmentally responsible practices by engaging with high profile and legitimate firms. In doing so, they reach a broad audience of firms who carefully observe and evaluate the activists-target interaction. Drawing on legitimacy theory and using a vignette-based roleplaying experiment, this paper investigates how different characteristics of both the activists' campaign and the targeted firms' response jointly affect the likelihood that observing firms' decision makers will support the sustainability practice recommended by the activists. Specifically, we assess how observers' evaluations of both the legitimacy of the target firms' decision and the legitimacy of activists' recommendation affect their support for the activists' recommendations. Subsequently, we evaluate the ways in which different characteristics of the activists-target interaction (including activists' engagement style, their evidence quality, and target firm adoption decision) drive these two legitimacy evaluations. Our results highlight the importance of both target decision legitimacy and activists' recommendation legitimacy on the relationship between target's practice adoption and observer support for the practice.",Legitimacy theory; Sustainable supply chain; Activist engagement; Vignette-based experiment,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-recommendation
Regretting your brand-self? The moderating role of consumer-brand identification on consumer responses to purchase regret,"Davvetas, V; Diamantopoulos, A",2017,10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.04.008,"Extending the study of consumer-brand relationships in the post-purchase stages of consumer decision making and in situations involving unfavorable comparisons with foregone brands, this research investigates the role of consumer-brand identification on consumer responses to purchase regret. Drawing on regret theory and consumer-brand relationship literature, the authors argue that consumer-brand identification immunizes the brand from the negative consequences of purchase regret through the amplification of consumers' cognitive regret regulation and the attenuation of consumers' behavioral regret coping. An empirical study using scenario manipulation of regret for participants' favorite brands provides support to the protective role of consumer brand identification. The results indicate that consumer-brand identification attenuates the negative effects of regret on satisfaction and behavioral intentions and strengthens the positive impact of satisfaction on brand repurchase/recommendation intent. The findings enrich regret and consumer-brand relationship theories and provide managerial insights for effective branding strategy development under conditions of intense competitive pressure.",Consumer-brand identification; Regret; Satisfaction; Consumer-brand relationships,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,wos-recommendation

The research sample was 120 consumers purchasing the private label products in modern stores using a purposive sampling technique. The data were then analyzed using SEM PLS. The result revealed that all hypotheses were accepted and each variable studied showed a strong and significant influence on each other, especially in terms of its influence on the purchase intention. In-store promotion is a more influencing variable of purchase intention in private label products than customer value. The result also pointed out the three most dominant items forming in-store promotion, customer value, and purchase intention. Those items are the frequency of discount program, the products' quality, and the reference group that helps the company promoting private label products, usually friends' recommendation.

Prick filter bubbles by enhancing consumers' novelty-seeking: The role of personalized recommendations of unmentionable products,"Lv, LX; Kang, KQ; Liu, GR",2024,10.1002/mar.22057,"Personalized recommendation algorithms inadvertently foster filter bubbles, wherein consumers are predominantly exposed to information that aligns with their existing preferences, limiting their exposure to novel items. This phenomenon raises ethical concerns regarding consumer well-being, as it potentially compromises the quality of consumption decisions by reinforcing a homogeneity of information. Introducing novelty into recommendation systems is a viable strategy to counteract this issue, as the predominance of homogeneous information plays a crucial role in the formation of filter bubbles. However, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding self-directed strategies for consumers to break through these filter bubbles. Grounded in social identification theory and utilizing a series of experimental studies, our research employs a range of analytical techniques, including ANOVA, mediation, and moderated-mediation analysis. Our findings suggest that personalized recommendations of unmentionable products, defined as products eliciting disgust, offense, or anger due to delicacy, ethics, or fear, (vs. ordinary products) can increase consumers' novelty-seeking by enhancing their motivation to change their implicit social labels given by intelligent recommendation systems. Nonetheless, we observe that this drive for novelty-seeking diminishes during social-focused recommendations because this recommendation is based on the behaviors of others in consumers' social networks rather than their actions.",filter bubbles; identity management; novelty-seeking; personalized recommendations; unmentionable products,WILEY,wos-recommendation

TOWARD FARM-BASED POLICY ANALYSIS - CONCEPTS APPLIED IN HAITI,"MARTINEZ, JC; SAIN, G; YATES, M",1991,10.1016/0169-5150(91)90045-M,"Many policies - on the delivery of inputs or on marketing systems, credit, or extension-influence the potential utilization of new technologies. Through 'farm-based policy analysis' it is possible to use data generated in on-farm research (OFR) to identify policy constraints to the use of new technologies, and to effectively communicate that information to policy makers. This paper describes a tentative framework for farm-based policy analysis and suggests a sequence of five steps for the analysis: (1) identify the policy-induced constraints; (2) determine the rationale behind the policy; (3) identify the decision makers to whom the results should be communicated; (4) identify solutions or policy options; and (5) communicate results to decision makers. A case of farm-based policy analysis from Haiti illustrates the concepts and methods described in the first part of the paper. On-farm experiments in Les Cayes, Haiti, confirmed a response to nitrogen in maize, but adoption of the recommended practice and consequent gains in productivity and income were constrained by the scarcity of urea in the local market. An analysis of local supply and potential local demand for urea and the potential benefits of urea application was conducted, and results communicated to two target groups of decision makers: representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for fertilizer distribution policy, and representatives of private fertilizer enterprises. These groups responded by making larger supplies of urea available to local farmers. Adoption of the fertilizer recommendation and urea sales increased.

When Does Retargeting Work? Information Specificity in Online Advertising,"Lambrecht, A; Tucker, C",2013,10.1509/jmr.11.0503,"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.",retargeting; online advertising; field experiments; online decision process; construal level theory,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-recommendation
When is more really more? The effect of brands on choice overload in adolescents,"Misuraca, R; Ceresia, F; Nixon, AE; Abbate, CS",2021,10.1108/JCM-08-2020-4021,"Purpose-Research on choice overload with adult participants has shown that the presence of a brand significantly mitigates the phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether these findings can be expanded to a population of adolescents, where it has already been shown that choice overload occurs in a similar way as adults. Design/methodology/approach-Studies 1 and 2 aim to test whether the presence of a brand name mitigates the adverse consequences of choice overload in adolescents. In line with prior research on choice overload, in both studies, the authors compared between-subjects differences in the levels of reported dissatisfaction, difficulty and regret in a choice condition where adolescents chose among either 6 or 24 options associated with brand names and in another choice condition where adolescents chose among the same 6 or 24 options but not associated with brand names. Findings-This paper presents evidence from two studies that when facing either a large or a small amount of choice options that are associated with brand names, choice overload disappears among adolescents. Conversely, when no brands are associated to the choice options, adolescents report choice overload, that is a greater dissatisfaction, difficulties and regret with larger (versus smaller) assortments. Practical implications-Prior research on choice overload has led to recommendations that marketers and other choice architects should simply reduce choice options or assortments to improve consumers' satisfaction. However, our finding suggests that this recommendation may be invalidated when brands are present, at least for certain age groups. Adolescents cope indeed very well with large assortments of branded products. Originality/value-The research adds to the existing understanding of choice overload, demonstrating that the brand is a moderator of the phenomenon for adolescents, who currently represent a large portion of the market. A second important contribution of this work is that it extends prior research on choice overload to real-world consumer scenarios, where consumers choose among products with a brand, rather than among products described only by technical characteristics or nutritional values, as in classical studies on choice overload.",Brands; Adolescents; Decision-making; Choice overload,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-recommendation

Recent work suggests that conservatives are less likely to complain than liberals. Building on that work, the present research examines how political identity shapes customer satisfaction, which has broad implications for customers and firms. Nine studies combine different methodologies, primary and secondary data, real and hypothetical behavior, different product categories, and diverse participant populations to show that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more satisfied with the products and services they consume. This happens because conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to believe in free will (i.e., that people have agency over their decisions) and, therefore, to trust their own decisions. The authors document the broad and tangible downstream consequences of this effect for customers' repurchase and recommendation intentions and firms' sales. The association of political identity and customer satisfaction is attenuated when belief in free will is externally weakened, choice is limited, or the consumption experience is overwhelmingly positive.",political identity; belief in free will; customer satisfaction; repurchase intention; sales; political ideology,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-recommendation
The Impact of Online and Offline Information Sources on Automobile Choice Behavior,"Kulkarni, G; Ratchford, BT; Kannan, PK",2012,10.1016/j.intmar.2012.02.001,"The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The third study examined the relative effectiveness of two recommendation sources. The experimental results revealed that subjects used the choices and evaluations of others as cues for making their own choices. However, herding effects are offset significantly by negative comments from others.

Optimal Referral Bonuses with Asymmetric Information: Firm-Offered and Interpersonal Incentives,"Kornish, LJ; Li, QP",2010,10.1287/mksc.1080.0484,"Referral bonuses, in which an existing customer gets an in-kind or cash reward for referring a new customer, are a popular way to stimulate word of mouth. In this paper, we examine key firm decisions about such bonuses. Others have studied referral bonus programs; a key difference is that we study the role of recommendations not just in spreading awareness (as they do) but also in providing assessments. We start with the idea that people have a variety of reasons for making product recommendations, including placing a value on a friend's outcome with a product they recommend. We apply that idea in a context of asymmetric information: A customer combines his knowledge about the product and his familiarity with friends' tastes, making him more informed than the friends. Thus, the recommendation is a signal about the value of the product to the friend. In this setting, we consistently find that the greater the concern for others' outcomes, the higher the referral bonus should be, as long as the firm cannot more efficiently motivate recommendations with a lower price. Moreover, if price is the more efficient lever, the optimal bonus is zero, and the optimal price is low. We also show that greater concern tends to reduce firm profit and, in some cases, actually reduces consumer welfare as well.",word of mouth; reward programs; pricing,INFORMS,wos-recommendation

Why analyst overconfidence about the functional form of demand models can lead to overpricing,"Montgomery, AL; Bradlow, ET",1999,10.1287/mksc.18.4.569,"Generally, profit predictions are made conditional upon a particular functional form. The typical caveat offered is that this is not the true demand model, but is instead some reasonable approximation. We show how the notion of an approximation can be explicitly represented using a random coefficient model. Our model nests the usual situation of complete model certainty as a special case. We go on to show how ignoring the uncertainty in functional form induced by approximation will lead to erroneous pricing decisions that may frequently lead to overpricing. For example, an inelastic, double-log demand model implies infinite optimal prices. This is clearly a nonsensical, analyst recommendation. We propose a more general form of the double-log model that allows for high confidence in the observed price range, but incorporates increased uncertainty about the adequacy of the double-log approximation as prices move beyond the observed range. The optimal pricing solutions for this new model are lower than those for the usual case with complete certainty. In fact, we find well-defined optimal pricing solutions even for inelastic double-log demand models. This is a finding of great practical importance, given that aggregate demand models tend to be inelastic for grocery categories, and that log demand models are frequently used (Hoch et al. 1995). We argue that the lack of recognizing uncertainty in the modeling process may partially account for why there is a seeming disparity between observed retail prices and the optimal prices implied by maximizing total category profits using estimated demand models (Little and Shapiro 1980). The problems of making optimal pricing decisions using double-log demand models calibrated with store-level scanner data have been recognized. Previous solutions are to constrain the results to achieve reasonable solutions (Reibstein and Gatignon 1984, Montgomery 1997) or to avoid these models altogether in favor of household choice models aggregated to the store-level (Vilcassim and Chintagunta 1995). Our assessment of the problem is that it is not necessarily an issue of model specification, but one of inference. In other words, double-log models fit well, but optimization leads to out-of-range predictions. Our suggestion is that inferences from an estimated demand model need to be approached with some caution. Specifically, uncertainty about predictions will always exist. If this uncertainty is incorporated into models such as the double-log form, then much better inferences can be made. It is our hope that this research will encourage others to think not only about model specification and estimation, but also inference.",approximations; demand estimation; pricing research; random; coefficient models; retailing,INFORMS,wos-recommendation
The anatomy of non-Muslim consumers' halal fashion buying behaviour: a quantitative approach,"Tarofder, AK; Sultana, US; Ismail, R; Salem, SF; Musah, AA",2022,10.1108/JIMA-05-2020-0156,"Purpose The purpose of this study is two-fold: classifying non-Muslim halal fashion buyers by applying quantitative techniques and identifying the persuading determinants of the non-Muslim women' halal fashion buying behaviour (HFBB). Design/methodology/approach By adapting items from prior studies, a structured questionnaire was developed and distributed face-to-face to various Muslim fashion stores in Malaysia. After a one-month effort, 221 responses were obtained from non-Muslim consumers by using convenience sampling. Next, a clustering analysis was used to classify them from a contrasting perspective. Finally, regression and Andrew F. Hayes's process procedures were applied to examine the three independent variables' effect and the moderating variables. Findings The results revealed the characteristic behaviour of the non-Muslim women explicitly, which is related to their halal fashion purchasing decision. Based on the ANOVA results, there were different motives for buying halal fashion by non-Muslim women. Additionally, it was found that the most crucial determinants for non-Muslim's HFBB are cultural adaptation, albeit, there is no substantial proof of a significant moderating effect of age and income on the consumers. Research limitations/implications These discoveries are advantageous for halal fashion retailers and provide an appealing domain for further investigations in the context of the global halal study. Practical implications This study provided an idea for an untapped segment on the halal fashion sellers' segmentation and positioning strategy. The study's results suggested specific managerial and practical recommendation that the sellers can use to attract non-Muslim consumers. Originality/value This study was amongst the uncommon investigations within the halal fashion context that will enlighten the managers' selling strategy on the most neglected market segment. The results of this study provided an empirical understanding of how to sell halal fashion to non-Muslim consumers.",Segmentation; Strategy; Fashion consciousness; Cultural adaptation; Fashion uniqueness; Halal fashion,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-recommendation
INNOVATIONS AND TOURISM REGIONS: ARE INNOVATIONS PERCEIVED AS A PROBLEM IN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPEAN TOURISM?,"Kubickova, V; Labudova, V; Benesova, D; Mura, L",2023,10.21272/mmi.2023.3-17,"This article examines innovative aspects of the development of tourism regions in Europe. The article aims to determine the intensity of the perception of innovation in the tourism region as a problem in its development. The ambition of the article is to assess the problems in the development of tourism regions in Europe in the field of innovation as a possible starting point for optimizing changes in local and regional tourism policy. The research analyses the positions of 95 regional tourism experts from 17 European countries. The database was based on a databank of 150 representatives of academia and 275 representatives of regional tourism organizations. To analyse the properties of categorical data and the relationships between them, we used Gamma, Kendall's Tau-b, Somers' D C vertical bar R, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi Coefficient, Contingency Coefficient, Cramer's V and the decision tree algorithm. The maturity of the innovation environment of tourism regions and their level of development influence the perception of innovations as a problem in their development. Southern European tourism regions perceive innovation as a problem in their development most intensively. Tourism regions with stronger innovation activity have a well-established quality management system and a comprehensive and systematically addressed supply of seasonal and off-season products. Tourism regions ranked in the emerging innovator group perceive the specified problems in the implementation of innovations more intensively. This reflects the lack of coordination of the product portfolio, both in terms of range and quality, in countries where the innovation environment is poorly developed. A key recommendation to mitigate the perception of innovations as a problem in the development of Europe's tourism regions is to focus attention on the implementation of regional policy instruments that stimulate the participation of tourism in the synergy effects of the existing innovation environment of the economy.",innovation; innovation environment; perception of innovations; regional development; tourism region,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY",wos-recommendation
The impact of digital transformation on the retailing value chain,"Reinartz, W; Wiegand, N; Imschloss, M",2019,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2018.12.002,"Consumers have traditionally made purchase decisions at the store shelf, giving institutional brick-and-mortar retailers great power to learn about and influence behaviors and preferences. With the rise of e-commerce, mobile shopping, and most recently smart technologies, new competitors threaten this long-standing supremacy. Adopting a value-creation perspective, we analyze how digitization started the erosion of institutional retailing as the primary interface to the customer. We develop a framework that identifies five new sources of value creation and propose how these advance and transform competition for this interface. Depending on the importance of the new sources of value creation (in different purchase situations), stationary retailing may prevail as an important interaction point in a multichannel decision journey. However, increasing diffusion of branded-product platforms including connected devices and online retail platforms is shifting this authority to new players. For the parties involved in this multilayered competition, acknowledging the changes and actively managing their position in the evolving eco-systems is crucial. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

I love the product but will you? The role of interpersonal attachment styles in social projection,"David, ME",2018,10.1002/mar.21080,"Individuals often have a need to predict the preferences of others (e.g., offering a recommendation, gift giving). In doing so, it is not uncommon that individuals project their attitudes and preferences onto others. Extant consumer research literature related to social projection focuses largely on particular situational variables that influence social projection. The current research adds to a smaller body of consumer research which focuses on specific characteristics of consumers' selves that may drive an individual's tendency to project his/her attitudes onto others. Specifically, the present paper explores an individual-level moderator of social projection, namely, interpersonal attachment style. Across five studies, interpersonal attachment style, and attachment anxiety, specifically, is shown to influence social projection. In addition, the mechanism underlying this relationship is demonstrated. The results show that high (vs. low) anxious attachment individuals tend to naturally consider more counter-valence attributes of a product, that is., liked attributes of a disliked product and disliked attributes of a liked product, and this availability of counter-valence attributes lowers social projection. Important theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",attachment anxiety; attachment theory; counter-valence attributes; interpersonal attachment styles; social projection,WILEY,wos-recommendation
Brand identity fit in co-branding The moderating role of C-B identification and consumer coping,"Xiao, N; Lee, SH",2014,10.1108/EJM-02-2012-0075,"Purpose - This paper aims to introduce brand identity (BI) fit as an important factor that influences co-branding success. Based on motivated reasoning theory, the authors propose consumer-brand (C-B) identification moderates the effect of BI fit on co-branding attitudes. In addition, they investigate the role of consumer coping and perceived BI fit on consumers' attitude toward co-branding. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were conducted to test the research hypotheses. Findings - Study 1 results reveal that when C-B identification is low, consumers' co-branding evaluations and the loyalty of the focal brand are higher in the low BI fit condition than those in the high BI fit condition. When C-B identification is high, such effects are not observed. Study 2 results reveal that when the BI fit is low, decoupling is more effective than biased assimilation at defending the positive evaluations of the focal brand. Research limitations/implications - First, while the authors focus particularly on BI fit, it may be fruitful for marketers to combine BI fit with other types of fit such as functional dimension fit and product category fit. For example, while the results suggest marketers should co-brand with low BI fit pairs when targeting at low C-B identification consumers, this recommendation should be taken in conjunction with how consumers respond to other co-branding fit strategies. Second, the authors encourage future researchers to explore deeper into the consumer coping in other contexts. As these elements are critical to consumers' attitudes, it will be beneficial to see how decoupling or biased assimilation strategies differ in other co-branding fit contexts. Practical implications - The authors advise marketers to consider both the level of BI fit and the level of C-B identification when looking for a co-brand partner. When targeting low C-B identification consumers, it is better for marketers to find a co-branding partner with a low BI fit than high BI fit. This is a counterintuitive finding given that higher fit (e. g. product category fit and brand image fit) is often associated with positive evaluations. For high C-B identification consumers, BI fit does not adversely affect consumer attitudes (and loyalty). Thus, these consumers are safer targets for marketers in terms of maintaining attitudes. Second, the authors find that when perceived BI fit is low, decoupling strategy is more effective than biased assimilation strategy at defending the positive evaluations of the focal brand. However, when perceived BI fit is high, the two coping strategies have little difference in influencing co-branding attitudes. Thus, the authors advise marketers to encourage their consumers to cope using a decoupling strategy to garner higher attitudes. Originality/value - The authors introduce BI fit as an important abstract dimension of brand image fit when facing co-branding decisions. Overall, our results demonstrate C-B identification moderates the effects of BI fit on co-branding attitudes. Counter-intuitively, the results suggest that low BI fit co-branding can also generate higher attitudes depending on consumers' level of brand identification. Moreover, marketers must also be wary of how consumers cope with co-branding, as coping explains the underlying mechanism of how consumers deal with high or low perceived BI fit. Specifically, our findings suggest that consumer coping moderates the relationship between perceived BI fit and co-branding attitudes.",Brand identity fit; Co-branding; Consumer coping; Consumer-brand identification,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,wos-recommendation
Reducing deviant consumer behaviour with service robot guardians,"Dootson, P; Greer, DA; Letheren, K; Daunt, KL",2023,10.1108/JSM-11-2021-0400,"Purpose The purpose of this research is to understand whether service robots can safeguard servicescapes from deviant consumer behaviour. Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour.",Service innovation; Consumer deviance; Robotics; Servicescape,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-robot
Customer Perceptions among Product and Brand Alternatives: Analysis and Consolidation of Models of Brand Choice Behavior,"Teleaba, F; Popescu, S; Ilesan, H",2021,,"Understanding how consumers evaluate product and brand alternatives and perceive their quality should be of paramount importance to marketing, product development and quality management. Several brand choice behavior models have been researched in literature, from utility maximization models in traditional economics, to attributebased sequential elimination or selection models and heuristics in behavioral economics, to two-stage models combining some of these principles. Previous attempts to provide an overview of these models have been incomplete. We provide an analysis and exhaustive, up to date, consolidation of brand choice behavior models, and conclude selected shortcomings and opportunities for improvement in current research literature. This consolidation is a one-stop shop for consumer behavior researchers, and marketing, product development and quality management professionals, who want to understand the different models, processes or steps adopted by consumers in evaluating brand and product alternatives and making their choice.",brand choice behavior; customer behavior; consumer choice,SOC ROMANA PENTRU ASIGURAREA CALITATII,wos-robot
A decision support system framework to track consumer sentiments in social media,"Nave, M; Rita, P; Guerreiro, J",2018,10.1080/19368623.2018.1435327,"With the evolution of web 2.0 and social networks, customers and companies' online interaction is growing at a fast pace, containing valuable insights about consumers' expectations that should be monitored and explored in a day-to-day basis. However, such information is highly unstructured and difficult to analyze. There is an urgent need to set up transparent methods and processes to integrate such information in the tourism industry technological infrastructure, especially for small firms that are unable to pay for expensive services to monitor their online reputation. The current paper uses a text mining and sentimental analysis technique to structure online reviews and present them on a decision support system with two different dashboards to assist in decision-making.

Designing marketing content for social commerce to drive consumer purchase behaviors: A perspective from speech act theory,"Wang, F; Xu, HF; Hou, RL; Zhu, Z",2023,10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103156,"With the emergence of content-driven social commerce, designing marketing content that better stimulates consumer purchase behaviors has become increasingly essential. However, it remains unclear what and how linguistic features of marketing content in emerging social commerce influence consumer purchase behaviors. Drawing on speech act theory, this paper proposes a multi-level research model to conceptualize the linguistic features of content from the aspects of word usage (micro level), within-content argument development (macro level), and between-content linguistic mimicry (meta level), and investigate their impact on consumer purchase behaviors. With a unique dataset that includes 44,256 textual posts from JD WeChat shopping circle (a content -driven social commerce platform), this paper combines text mining methods with a series of regression analyses to test the research model. The empirical analyses find that the number of customers who make a purchase increases 1) at the micro-level due to self-referencing and detailing, 2) at the macro-level due to argument structuring, and 3) at the meta-level due to linguistic style matching, while linguistic content matching nega-tively affects the number of customers. These findings reveal how content creators strategically use language to design marketing content that encourages consumer purchase behaviors in emerging social commerce.

Efficient Methods for Sampling Responses from Large-Scale Qualitative Data,"Singh, SN; Hillmer, S; Wang, Z",2011,10.1287/mksc.1100.0632,"The World Wide Web contains a vast corpus of consumer-generated content that holds invaluable insights for improving the product and service offerings of firms. Yet the typical method for extracting diagnostic information from online content-text mining-has limitations. As a starting point, we propose analyzing a sample of comments before initiating text mining. Using a combination of real data and simulations, we demonstrate that a sampling procedure that selects respondents whose comments contain a large amount of information is superior to the two most popular sampling methods-simple random sampling and stratified random sampling-in gaining insights from the data. In addition, we derive a method that determines the probability of observing diagnostic information repeated a specific number of times in the population, which will enable managers to base sample size decisions on the trade-off between obtaining additional diagnostic information and the added expense of a larger sample. We provide an illustration of one of the methods using a real data set from a website containing qualitative comments about staying at a hotel and demonstrate how sampling qualitative comments can be a useful first step in text mining.",consumer-generated media; consumer-generated content; customer feedback on the Web; text mining; qualitative comments; large-scale qualitative data sets; sampling open-ended questions,INFORMS,wos-text mining
Understanding what concerns consumers: a semantic approach to product feature extraction from consumer reviews,"Wei, CP; Chen, YM; Yang, CS; Yang, CC",2010,10.1007/s10257-009-0113-9,"The Web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions (more specifically, consumer reviews) about products. Consumer reviews are essential for retailers and product manufacturers to understand the general responses of customers to their products and improve their marketing campaigns or products accordingly. In addition, consumer reviews enable retailers to recognize the specific preferences of each customer, which facilitates effective marketing decisions. As the number of consumer reviews expands, it is essential and desirable to develop an efficient and effective sentiment analysis technique that is capable of extracting product features stated in consumer reviews (i.e., product feature extraction) and determining the sentiments (positive or negative semantic orientations) of consumers for these product features (i.e., opinion orientation identification). Product feature extraction is critical to sentiment analysis, because its effectiveness significantly affects the performance of opinion orientation identification, as well as the ultimate effectiveness of sentiment analysis. Therefore, this study concentrates on product feature extraction from consumer reviews. Specifically, we propose a semantic-based product feature extraction (SPE) technique that exploits a list of positive and negative adjectives defined in the General Inquirer to recognize opinion words semantically and subsequently extract product features expressed in consumer reviews. Using a prevalent product feature extraction technique and the SPE-GI technique (a variant of SPE) as performance benchmarks, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed SPE technique outperforms both benchmark techniques.",Consumer review; Sentiment analysis; Product feature extraction; Opinion summarization; Text mining,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,wos-text mining
More Than Words: The Influence of Affective Content and Linguistic Style Matches in Online Reviews on Conversion Rates,"Ludwig, S; de Ruyter, K; Friedman, M; Brüggen, EC; Wetzels, M; Pfann, G",2013,10.1509/jm.11.0560,"Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.",online customer reviews; affective content; linguistic style match; conversion rate; Internet marketing,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-text mining
Effects of online customer reviews on sustainable clothing purchase intentions: The mediating role of perceived diagnosticity,"Huang, CH; Chen, CH; Wang, HJ",2024,10.1002/cb.2344,"Online customer reviews play a vital role in evaluating product or service performance and serve as an important reference for other customers' purchase decisions.

The results showed that online customer reviews focused on four dimensions: material ecology, clothing fashion, clothing functionality, and price reasonableness. Online customer reviews have a positive impact on consumers' sustainable purchase intentions, and perceived diagnosticity mediates the relationship between online customer reviews and purchase intentions. In addition, customers' prior sustainability knowledge moderates the relationship between material ecology, price reasonableness, and perceived diagnosticity.

Modeling the role of message content and influencers in social media rebroadcasting,"Zhang, YC; Moe, WW; Schweidel, DA",2017,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.07.003,"We develop a model that examines the role of content, content-user fit, and influence on social media rebroadcasting behavior. While previous research has studied the role of content or the role of influence in the spread of social media content separately, none has simultaneously examined both in an effort to assess the relative effects of each. Our modeling approach also accounts for a message's fit with users, based on the content of the message and the content of messages typically shared by users. As an empirical application, we examine how Twitter posts originating from top business schools are subsequently rebroadcasted (or retweeted) by other users. We employ an individual-level split hazard model that accounts for variation in rebroadcasting decisions related to (1) content, (2) the content-user fit and (3) the influence of other users. We find that the rebroadcasting a message depends not only on message content but also on the message's fit with a user. Our analysis also yields measures of influence and susceptibility to influence for each user, which can be used to identify influential social media users. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to evaluate different types of seeding strategies designed to increase the reach of social media messages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Effects of Comparative Reviews on Product Sales,"Zhang, M; Li, YZ; Sun, L; Wang, GA; Du, JA",2024,10.1177/10949968231196578,"Consumers increasingly rely on online reviews to make their purchase decisions. Drawing from linguistics and sociology research, the authors posit that comparative reviews, which highlight the similarities and differences between a focal product and its alternatives, may influence consumers' regulation systems and perceived credibility, thereby affecting product sales. The authors examined 61,480 reviews on e-commerce platforms to explore the effects of comparative reviews and their valence on product sales. By using a supervised learning approach, they identified positive and negative comparative reviews, as well as positive and negative regular reviews, and then applied a two-way fixed-effects model. The results show that comparative reviews positively impacted product sales. Specifically, positive comparative reviews had a greater effect than positive regular reviews, whereas negative comparative reviews had a lesser absolute effect than negative regular reviews on product sales. Moreover, positive comparative reviews exerted a greater absolute effect than negative ones. A follow-up controlled lab study further substantiated the authors' results and insights. The findings offer new insights and practical guidance for marketers and practitioners in promoting more comparative review posts and optimizing online review presentations.",comparative reviews; product sales; attribution theory; online reviews; text mining,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-text mining
