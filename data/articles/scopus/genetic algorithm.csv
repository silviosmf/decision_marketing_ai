The considered network is comprised of a central warehouse, a set of distribution centers, and a set of retailers and wholesalers. The objective of the problem is to maximize the supply chain profit. The decisions include the location of distribution centers and the allocation of retailers and wholesalers to them, order-size for each distribution center and product price at retail and wholesale channels for different payment conditions. A mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model was formulated and solved using the Lagrangian relaxation method and a Genetic algorithm. Computational results indicate that Lagrangian relaxation algorithm has good performance in terms of objective function value and runtime, even in large sized problems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Competitive retailing; Distribution network design; Dual-channel distribution planning; Fast-moving consumer goods; Inventory management; Lagrangian relaxation; Pricing policy","competition (economics); consumption behavior; Lagrangian analysis; network design; price dynamics; pricing policy; stochasticity; supply chain management","","","","","","","Ahmadi G., Torabi S.A., Tavakkoli-Moghaddam R., A bi-objective location-inventory model with capacitated transportation and lateral transshipments, Int.

Allocation of marketing budgets to these valuable assets is critical; because the way companies allocate their marketing budgets to customers affects their profitability. The purpose of this research is to provide a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments in a long-term view and a dynamic process. The contribution of the model is as follows: (1) unlike the previous modeling efforts where a predefined budget level was assigned to acquisition and retention, the suggested model sets and allocates marketing budgets simultaneously; (2) the model is multi-period which means the strategies for setting and allocation of marketing budgets may be different in each period. The proposed approach aims at maximizing customer equity in a long-term planning horizon with several periods. Decision variables determine how the budgets should be assigned to customer acquisition and retention in each period. Formulation of the model is followed by a numerical illustration. Since the model is nonlinear and non-convex, none of exact mathematical programming approaches may solve it. Therefore, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing approaches were employed. The results showed the effectiveness of the model compared with other extant models. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Budget allocation; Customer acquisition; Customer equity; Customer retention; Decision calculus; Genetic algorithm; Simulated annealing","","","","","","","","Albadvi A., Koosha H., A robust optimization approach to allocation of marketing budgets, Manag Decis, 49, 4, pp. 601-621, (2011); Bazaraa M.S., Sherali H.D., Shetty C.M., Nonlinear programming, (2006); Berger P.D., Bechwati N.N., The allocation of promotion budget to maximize customer equity, Omega Int J Manag Sci, 29, 1, pp. 49-62, (2001); Blattberg R.C., Deighton J., Manage marketing by the customer equity test, Harv Bus Rev, 74, 4, pp. 136-144, (1996); Chan S.L., Ip W.H., A dynamic decision support system to predict the value of customer for new product development, Decis Support Syst, 52, 1, pp. 178-188, (2011); Ching W.K., Ng M.K., Wong K.K., Altman E., Customer lifetime value: stochastic optimization approach, J Oper Res Soc, 55, 1, pp. 860-868, (2004); Chuang Y.F., Chian S.H., Wong J.Y., Customer value assessment of pharmaceutical marketing in Taiwan, Ind Manag Data Syst, 113, 9, pp. 1315-1333, (2013); Dong W., Swain S.D., Berger P.D., The role of channel quality in customer equity management, J Bus Res, 60, 12, pp. 1243-1252, (2007); Dreo J., Petrowski A., Siarry P., Taillard E., Metaheuristics for hard optimization, (2006); Fischer M., Albers S., Wagner N., Frie M., Dynamic marketing budget allocation across countries, products, and marketing activities, Mark Sci, 30, 4, pp. 568-585, (2011); Gen M., Cheng R., Genetic algorithms and engineering design, (1997); Hand D.J., Modelling consumer credit risk, IMA J Manag Math, 12, 2, pp. 139-155, (2001); Hogan J.E., Lemon K.N., Rust R.T., Customer equity management: charting new directions for the future of marketing, J Serv Res USA, 5, 1, pp. 4-12, (2002); Holthausen D.M., Assmus G., Advertising budget allocation under uncertainty, Manag Sci, 28, 5, pp. 487-499, (1982); Hyun S.S., Creating a model of customer equity for chain restaurant brand formation, Int J Hosp Manag, 28, 1, pp. 529-539, (2009); Kim A.J., Ko E., Do social media marketing activities enhance customer equity?

This paper investigates a multi-product and multi-period advertising budget allocation, determining the amount of advertising budget for each product through the time horizon. Imperative factors including life cycle stage, BCG matrix class, competitors’ reactions, and budget constraints affect the joint chain of decisions for all products to maximize the total profits. To do so, we define a stochastic sequential resource allocation problem and use an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to alleviate the huge size of the problem and multi-dimensional uncertainties of the environment. These uncertainties are the reactions of competitors based on the current status of the market and our decisions, as well as the stochastic effectiveness (rewards) of the taken action. We apply an approximate value iteration (AV I) algorithm on a numerical example and compare the results with four different policies to highlight our managerial contributions. In the end, the validity of our proposed approach is assessed against a genetic algorithm. To do so, we simplify the environment by fixing the competitor’s reaction and considering a deterministic environment. © 2022,Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization.

It proposes a reverse logistics network model of a dual-channel model with multiple objectives and a random environment for the construction of recycling boxes projects and uses a Stackelberg game to develop pricing strategies for dual-channel recyclers and a genetic algorithm to optimize reverse logistics networks. This paper found the following: multi-objective evaluation is more conducive to sustainable development; when consumers are price-sensitive, a stronger rebate can significantly increase revenue; online platform recyclers should invest more in marketing than traditional recyclers; retailers’ willingness to cooperate in recycling has a significant impact on the overall benefits; the impact of government subsidies is marginal and needs to be controlled to a certain extent; the impact of green credit is insignificant, and the strength of commercial banks’ scrutiny of companies has little effect; an increase in environmental uncertainty within a certain range can lead to an overall loss of benefits, and an excessive impact can be out of line with extreme values. It provides a basis for decision-making on strategies for enterprises to build a logistics network of recycling boxes, government subsidies, green credit from banks, and dual-channel recyclers. © 2023 by the authors.","dual-channel; genetic algorithm; multi-objective; recycling boxes; reverse logistics; Stackelberg game; uncertain environment","genetic algorithm; logistics; marketing; multiobjective programming; optimization; recycling; uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","Minner S., Strategic safety stocks in reverse logistics supply chains, Int.

A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

For a certain advertisement category, advertising effectiveness is largely dependent upon its exposure times to the target audience who takes interest in advertisement, which is termed targeted advertising. Given that the distribution of target audiences over a city varies among different advertisement categories, a practical way of enhancing overall advertising effectiveness is to deploy a bus with certain advertisement category to the bus line that best fits its target area. This gives rise to a decision-making problem of targeted bus exterior advertising and bus scheduling. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a biobjective optimization model with objectives of maximizing the quantified advertising effectiveness and minimizing the number of bus fleet size to cover all trips. The advertising effectiveness is quantified using audience demographic data. The deadheading of buses is also enabled in the scheduling process to facilitate both objectives. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-Large Neighborhood Search (NSGA-II-LNS) algorithm is developed to solve the biobjective problem with the incorporation of large neighborhood search operators into the framework of the NSGA-II to improve solution quality. Various experiments were set up to verify the proposed model and solution algorithm.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Biobjective optimization; Bus deadheading; Bus scheduling; Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-Large Neighborhood Search (NSGA-II-LNS); Targeted bus exterior advertising","Decision making; Fleet operations; Genetic algorithms; Marketing; Sorting; Advertizing; Advertizing effectiveness; Bi-objective optimization; Bus deadheading; Bus scheduling; Large neighbourhood searches; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II-large neighborhood search; Target audience; Targeted bus exterior advertizing; advertising; bus transport; genetic algorithm; numerical model; optimization; Buses","","","","","","","Public Transportation Facts, (2019); Bie Y., Ji J., Wang X., Qu X., Optimization of electric bus scheduling considering stochastic volatilities in trip travel time and energy consumption, Comput.-Aided Civ.

In the proposed model, shortages are allowed and demand rate is a power function of service and marketing costs, and selling price. The main objective of this study is to optimize retailer’s payments time, service and marketing expenditure, and replenishment decisions in order to maximize retailer’s total profit and minimize carbon emissions, simultaneously. Model is developed in a fuzzy environment under carbon tax regulation when the length of credit period provided by supplier is less than or equal to the length of time in which no shortage happens. To solve the proposed model, we first transform the original problem into a multi-objective Signomial Geometric Programming (SGP) problem using fuzzy and hybrid parameters, which minimizes both the mean value and the total dispersion value of the objective function. Then a global optimization problem method has been used to solve the SGP problem. Efficiency of this algorithm is tested and compared with multi-objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective genetic algorithm with varying population, and hybrid heuristic algorithm. At the end, several numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are performed to demonstrate the application of the proposed model and solution procedure to obtain managerial insights. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions;

Fulfilment of planned product lines must make trade-offs between product variety and production costs. To balance the costs of product lines, manufacturers often adopt a product platform configuration (PPC) approach to redesign product and process platforms by adding new modules to the legacy platforms. The PPC is an effective means of providing product variety while controlling the manufacturing costs. The PLP and PPC problems have traditionally been investigated separately in the marketing research and engineering design fields. It is important to coordinate PLP and PPC decisions within a coherent optimisation framework. This paper proposes a bilevel mixed 0–1 nonlinear programming model to formulate coordinated optimisation for platform-driven product line planning. The upper level deals with the PLP problem by maximising the profit of an entire product line, whilst the lower level copes with the multiple product platforms optimisation for the optimal PPC in accordance with the upper level decisions of product line structure. To solve this bilevel programming model, a bilevel genetic algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution. A case study of coordinated optimisation between an automobile line and its product platforms is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bilevel programming in comparison with a typical ‘all-in-one’ approach and a non-joint optimisation programming. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bilevel programming; coordinated optimisation; decision-making; design methods; product line; product platform","Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Marketing; Nonlinear programming; Bi-level programming; Design method; Optimisations; Product platforms; Product-lines; Product design","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71371132); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71371132].","Anandalingam G., White D.J., A Solution Method for the Linear Static Stackelberg Problem Using Penalty Functions, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 35, 10, pp. 1170-1173, (1990); Aydin R., Kwong C.K., Ji P., A Novel Methodology for Simultaneous Consideration of Remanufactured and New Products in Product Line Design, International Journal of Production Economics, 169, pp. 127-140, (2015); Aydin R., Kwong C.K., Ji P., Coordination of the Closed-loop Supply Chain for Product Line Design with Consideration of Remanufactured Products, Journal of Cleaner Production, 114, pp. 286-298, (2016); Bala R., Krishnan V., Zhu W., Distributed Development and Product Line Decisions, Production and Operations Management, 23, 6, pp. 1057-1066, (2014); Bard J.F., Moore J.T., A Branch and Bound Algorithm for the Bilevel Programming Problem, SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 11, 2, pp. 281-292, (1990); Ben-Akiva M.E., Lerman S.R., Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 4, pp. 370-371, (1987); Ben-Arieh D., Easton T., Choubey A.M., Solving the Multiple Platforms Configuration Problem, International Journal of Production Research, 47, 7, pp. 1969-1988, (2009); Bialas W.F., Karwan M.H., Two-level Linear Programming, Management Science, 30, 8, pp. 1004-1020, (1984); Biyalogorsky E., Koenigsberg O., The Design and Introduction of Product Lines When Consumer Valuations Are Uncertain, Production and Operations Management, 23, 9, pp. 1539-1548, (2014); Bracken J., Mcgill J.T., The Equivalence of Two Mathematical Programs with Optimization Problems in the Constraints, Equivalence of Two Mathematical Programs with Optimization Problems in the Constraints, 22, 5, pp. 1102-1104, (1973); Bradley R.A., Terry M.E., Rank Analysis of Incomplete Block Designs I, The Method of Paired Comparisons.

However, the logistics decisions in the vending machine service industry are challenging, coupled with complex constraints, considering the machine deployment location, product selection, shelf display allocation, and the elasticity of demands and spaces. This paper presents a bi-layer optimization model addressing the challenges associated with deployment location, product selection, and shelf display for a vending machine system consisting of more than ten thousand vending machines. The upper layer model selects appropriate locations for machine deployment, while the lower layer model considers product selection and shelf display in individual machines. Due to the high complexity of the problem, metaheuristic approaches are developed for seeking near-optimal solutions. The proposed model and algorithms are evaluated using various scales of problems, demonstrating their effectiveness in delivering premium logistics and operational solutions. Additionally, the study explores the impact of product cross and space elasticities. The proposed two-level genetic algorithm consistently performs better than Tabu search and Particle swarm optimization in small-scale and large-scale cases. The proposed approach can significantly enhance profitability for large-scale vending machine deployment in the vending machine service industry. © 2024","Bi-layer optimization; Elasticity; Genetic algorithm; Machine location; Product selection; Shelf display; Vending machine","Genetic algorithms; Location; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Tabu search; Bi-layer; Bi-layer optimization; Large-scales; Layer model; Machine location; Optimisations; Optimization approach; Product selection; Service industries; Shelf display; demand elasticity; genetic algorithm; logistics; optimization; service sector; Elasticity","","","","","","","Bianchi-Aguiar T., Hubner A., Carravilla M.A., Oliveira J.F., Retail shelf space planning problems: a comprehensive review and classification framework, Eur.
