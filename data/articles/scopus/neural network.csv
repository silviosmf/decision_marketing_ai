However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021","Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Electric vehicles; Support vector machines; Adoption; Imputation; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Market evolution; Methodological tools; Neural-networks; Strategic decision making; Supervised machine learning; Support vectors machine; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; prediction; statistical data; supervised classification; supervised learning; technology adoption; Forecasting","","","","","","","Bas J., Cirillo C., Cherchi E., A Stated Choice Experiment for consodering Social Conformity in the adoption of Electric Vehicles, ISCTSC 2020 - The 12th International Conference on Transport Survey Methods, (2020); Berkeley N., Bailey D., Jones A., Jarvis D., Assessing the transition towards Battery Electric Vehicles: A Multi-Level Perspective on drivers of, and barriers to, take up, Transportation Research part A: policy and practice, 106, pp. 320-332, (2017); Bezdek J.C., Hathaway R.J., VAT: a tool for visual assessment of (cluster) tendency., Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCC ’02), 3, pp. 2225-2230, (2002); Bolton R.J., Hand D.J., Statistical fraud detection: a review, Stat.

A major challenge in this issue is considering the possibility of changes in the behavior of customers with the turn of time in the model. In this study, a new approach has been used to estimate the parameters of the model proposed for calculating the future lifetime value of Iran Khodro Spare Parts and After-Sale Services Co. (ISACO) customers. This method takes into consideration the possibility of changes in customer behavior throughout their interaction with the company. In this article, the customers of ISACO are first classified using clustering techniques and use multilayer neural network to calculate the monetary value of each group of customers during a specific period of time. Then, the Markov chain approach is used to develop a model for calculating the lifetime value of ISACO's customers considering the possibility of changes in their behavior in different periods. The results obtained here can be used in the allocation of marketing budget and adoption of macro-management decisions to envisage various projects for customers with different lifetime values. © 2019 Iran University of Science and Technology.","Clustering;

The size of these data is impossible for traditional database and human analyst to come up with interesting information that will help in process of decision making. Management Information System (MIS) based Data warehouse (DW) and Data Mining (DM) techniques support the development of IT and process of management decision-making. But the traditional DW size make the query complex, which may cause unacceptable delay in decision support queries. Thus, in this paper an Efficient Electronic Bank MIS based DW and Mining Processing (EEBMIS-DWMP) was developed with cluster and non-cluster indexed view to provide decision-makers with both best response time and precise information. Also, analysis of the multilayer perception neural network, naïve Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and C5.0 on a real-world data of bank was done to improve effectiveness for campaign by analyzing the most useful features that influence campaign success. Results offer how the proposed EEBMIS-DWMP developed bank organizations by comparing performance of system with and without index view in terms of balance accuracy, accuracy, precision, recall, mean absolute error, root mean square error, F measure and running time. Conclusions from results offers that EEBMIS-DWMP can construct a database for each customer, a storage system that integrates data from a variety of sources into a single unified framework, decrease errors and time required to prepare financial reports, quickly access for information, analysis of data in multivariate, accurate prediction of competent, profitability segmentation. © 2022","Data mining; Data warehouse; Index view; Management information system; Marketing","Data handling; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Errors; Information management; Information use; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Query processing; Support vector machines; Bank managements; Data-mining techniques; Decision support query; Decisions makings; Design and implementations; In-process; Index view; Interesting information; Management decision-making; Mining processing; Data mining","","","","","Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Saudi Arabia; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation of China [Project in 2022：A Research on Synergetic Regulation and Supervision of ""Gray Rhino"" financial risks].

While CRM nirvana is the attainment of profitable one-to-one relationships, current activity is concentrated on segmentation. As technology has moved segmentation from simple classification towards more complex predictive modelling, the use of CRM analytic suites comprising statistical techniques such as decision trees, neural networks and cluster analysis is increasing. It is suggested that the subjective nature of cluster analysis may be overlooked when the technique is integrated with other ‘tools’ into a data-mining package and, consequently, that inadequately tested cluster analysis solutions may be contributing to CRM dissatisfaction. This paper reports the findings of a study which subjected a data set designed for segmentation purposes to a series of rigorous validity and reliability tests and went as far as to randomise the data to ascertain whether current methods could detect ‘false’ data. The study shows, alarmingly, that under certain conditions random data can ‘pass’ standard tests and highlights just how meticulously and thoroughly cluster analysis solutions must be tested before they can be safely used in formulating marketing strategy. Practical, theoretical and technical advice is offered for managers working with CRM analytics suites and avenues suggested for future research into improved CRM performance through effective management of the IT/marketing interface. © 2003 Market Research Society.","","","","","","","","","Aldenderfer M.S., Blashfield R.K., Cluster Analysis, (1984);

Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Errors; Fuzzy neural networks; Marketing; Product development; Accurate prediction; Business product development; Business products; Chatbots; Increasing production; Information loss; Marketing information; Neural network model; Performance; Product information; Neural network models","","","","","Guangxi 14th Five-Year Education Science Planning Project, (,2021A033, 2021ZJY1607, 2021ZJY1612, 2022ZJY1699.2022, 2022ZJY354); Guangxi Graduate Education, (JGY2022122); Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China, (21BGL129); Rural Agriculture, Culture and Tourism for Rural Revitalization, (22FGL024); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710038); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, (2020AC19034); Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents","Funding text 1: This work was sponsored by the following funds: ""Research on Multidimensional Identification and Long-term Governance Mechanism of Relative Poverty of Farming Households in Border Areas"" (Grant No. 20BGL247), General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China under the ""Two Mountains"" Theory, General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21BGL129); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation：A study on the mechanism of physician engagement behaviour in online medical communities from the perspective of network effects (No.2022M710038).

Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed. The proposed model can be applied as an effective decision-support tool for green building pricing and formulating marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Consumer behavior; Decision-support model; Green building; Price premium","","","","","","","","Ali H.H., Al Nsairat S.F., Developing a green building assessment tool for developing countries–Case of Jordan, Building and Environment, 44, 5, pp. 1053-1064, (2009); Attalla M., Hegazy T., Predicting cost deviation in reconstruction projects: Artificial neural networks versus regression, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 129, 4, pp. 405-411, (2003); Building Research Establishment Global, (2008); Chan E.H., Qian Q.K., Lam P.T., The market for green building in developed Asian cities—The perspectives of building designers, Energy Policy, 37, 8, pp. 3061-3070, (2009); Chau C.K., Tse M.S., Chung K.Y., A choice experiment to estimate the effect of green experience on preferences and willingness-to-pay for green building attributes, Building and Environment, 45, 11, pp. 2553-2561, (2010); Cheng C.L., Evaluating water conservation measures for Green Building in Taiwan, Building and Environment, 38, 2, pp. 369-379, (2003); Council, U.

Instead of having managers to decide on the campaign rules, such as, when, how and whom to offer, creating intelligent campaign management systems that can automate such decisions is essential. In addition, regulations or company policies usually restrict the number of accesses to the customers. Efficient learning of customer behaviour through dynamic campaign participation observations becomes a crucial feature that may ultimately define customer satisfaction and retention. This paper builds on the recent successes of deep learning techniques and proposes a classification model to predict customer responses for campaigns. Classic deep neural networks are good at learning hidden relations within data (i.e., patterns) but with limited capability for memorization. One solution to increase memorization is to use manually craft features, as in Wide & Deep networks, which are originally proposed for Google Play App. recommendations. We advocate using decision trees as an easier way of mining high-level relationships for enhancing Wide & Deep networks. Such an approach has the added benefit of beating manually created rules, which, most of the time, use incomplete data and have biases. A set of comprehensive experiments on campaign participation data from a leading GSM provider shows that automatically crafted features make a significant increase in the accuracy and outperform Deep and Wide & Deep models with manually crafted features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree classification; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Real-time marketing; Wide & Deep network models","Customer satisfaction; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Global system for mobile communications; Learning systems; Real time systems; Sales; Campaign managements; Classification models; Customer behaviour; Customer interaction; Customer response; Efficient learning; Learning techniques; Participation prediction; Deep learning","","","","","","","Akcura M.T., Srinivasan K., Research note: Customer intimacy and cross-selling strategy, Manag.

One of their biggest concerns is to recognize the impact of actions taken on sold-out products. Data mining discovers and extracts useful patterns from such large data sets to find hidden and worthy patterns for the decision-making. This paper, too, aims to demonstrate the ability of data-mining process in improving the decision-making quality in the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach: This research is descriptive in terms of the method applied, as well as the investigation of the existing situation and the use of real data and their description. In fact, the study is quantitative and descriptive, from the point of view of its data type and method. This research is also applicable in terms of purpose. The target population of this research is the data of a pharmaceutical company in Iran. Here, the cross-industry standard process for data mining methodology was used for data mining and data modeling. Findings: With the help of different data-mining techniques, the authors could examine the effect of the visit of doctors overlooking the pharmacies and the target was set for medical representatives on the pharmaceutical sales. For that matter, the authors used two types of classification rules: decision tree and neural network. After the modeling of algorithms, it was determined that the two aforementioned rules can perform the classification with high precision. The results of the tree ID3 were analyzed to identify the variables and path of this relationship. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to provide the real-world direct empirical evidence of “Analytics of Physicians Prescription and Pharmacies Sales Correlation Using Data Mining.” The results showed that the most influential variables of “the relationship between doctors and their visits to pharmacies,” “the length of customer relationship” and “the relationship between the sale of pharmacies and the target set for medical representatives” were “deviation from the implementation plan.” Therefore, marketing and sales managers must pay special attention to these factors while planning and targeting for representatives. The authors could focus only on a small part of this study. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Data mining; Decision tree; Pharmaceutical industry; RFM model","","","","","","","","Al-Hamdi A.Y., Ibrahim M., Hassali M., The role of healthcare professionals in establishing unhealthy pharmaceutical promotion activities in Yemen, Journal of Medical Marketing: Device, Diagnostic and Pharmaceutical Marketing, 13, 3, pp. 142-150, (2013);

In recent years, the rapid development and widespread application of AI have had a profound impact on enterprise management. Enterprise management is no longer limited to traditional manual decision-making and processes, but has been endowed with more efficient and intelligent methods through AI technology. The value co creation theory has completely changed the management methods of modern enterprises, transforming them from simple value carriers to active value co creators. In this situation, enterprise value chain management requires strategic enhancement, optimized design, functional management, and reputation management to adapt to these changes. The emergence of artificial intelligence as the core of the new industrial revolution further amplifies the importance of these adaptations. Under the guidance of value co creation theory, this article analyzes and explores the structure, characteristics, and transformation of enterprise value chains. Explored the management strategies of enterprise value chains, with a particular focus on the composition of consumer centered value chains. In addition, it also studied the use of artificial intelligence to deepen the enterprise management value chain, strengthen its architecture through artificial intelligence technology, and design an effective enterprise management system. Considering the changes in the business model of the entire value chain system, the transformation mechanism of artificial intelligence in the enterprise value chain was studied. Integrating neural network algorithms into enterprise management systems can achieve optimization and form a new enterprise management value chain. Empirical experiments and surveys have proven the effectiveness of the new value chain, significantly improving customer satisfaction (11.45%), customer experience satisfaction (13.61%), enterprise marketing satisfaction (11.73%), and enterprise service satisfaction (10.63%). © 2023, Success Culture Press.

The decision to pay these dividends to shareholders concerns several other groups of people, such as financial managers, consulting firms, individual and institutional investors, government and monitoring authorities, and creditors, just to name a few. The prediction and modelling of this decision has received a significant amount of attention in the corporate finance literature. However, the methods used to study the aforementioned question are limited to the logistic regression method without any implementation of the advanced and expert methods of data mining. These methods have proven their superiority in other business-related fields, such as marketing, production, accounting and auditing. In finance, bankruptcy prediction has the vast majority among data-mining implementations, but to the best of the authors’ knowledge such an implementation does not exist in dividend payment prediction. This paper satisfies this gap in the literature and provides answers that help to understand the so-called ‘dividend puzzle’. Specifically, this paper provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that data-mining methods perform better in accuracy measures against the traditional methods used. The prediction of dividend policy determinants provides valuable benefits to all related parties, as they can manage, invest, consult and monitor the dividend policy in a more effective way.

This information has been gathered because it may be important for dealing with complicated problems including fraud, marketing, healthcare, and cyber security. Analytics are used by big businesses like Facebook and Google to analyse and make decisions about their massive volumes of collected data. Such analyses and decisions impact both the present and the future of technology. The inherent non-linear properties in huge data may be captured by deep learning (DL) algorithms using automated feature extraction techniques. In order to estimate renewable energy, energy consumption, demand, and supply, among other things, over the short, medium, and long term, a complete and in-depth investigation of generative, hybrid, and discriminative DL models is being conducted. This article examines the benefits and drawbacks of DL that depends on a variety of deep neural networks, including recurrent neural networks, multilayer neural networks, auto encoders and long short-term memory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Big data analytics; Recurrent neural networks; Sequence data","Cybersecurity; Data Analytics; Deep neural networks; Energy utilization; Multilayer neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Automated feature extraction; Big data analytic; Cyber security; Data analytics; Decision impacts; Facebook; Feature extraction techniques; Google+; Nonlinear properties; Sequence data; Big data","","","","","","","Acharya S., Rai A., Venkatesh S., Ravindranath Chowdary C., A review of transfer learning in deep neural networks, J Big Data, 8, 1, pp. 1-21, (2021); Ahmad J., Larijani H., Emmanuel R., Mannion M., Javed A., Phillipson M., Energy demand prediction through novel random neural network predictor for large non-domestic buildings, Proc.

In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","LAI; Machine learning; NDVI; NDWI; Satellite remote sensing; Vineyard yield","","","","","","","","Afghanistan Central Statistics Organization, Centeral statistics organization of Afghanistan's statistical yearbook of 2018-2019, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan National Statistics and Information Authority, Kabul Afghanistan, 41, (2019); Aich V., Akhundzadah N.A., Knuerr A., Khoshbeen A.J., Hattermann F., Paeth H., Scanlon A., Paton E.N., Climate change in Afghanistan deduced from reanalysis and coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (cordex)—south Asia simulations, J.

Likewise, data science identified six predictive models for the use of Facebook in the educational context by means of the decision tree technique. Analysis using neural networks identified the influence of sending messages, watching instructional videos, and publishing exercises on Facebook during the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills. Finally, Facebook is a technological and communication tool that transforms the organization of teaching and learning activities in financial mathematics education.

Extracting useful information from the huge volumes of data is always difficult due to the dynamic nature of data being stored. Data Mining is a knowledge discovery process used to extract the hidden information from the data stored in various repositories, termed as warehouses in the form of patterns. One of the popular tasks of data mining is Classification, which deals with the process of distinguishing every instance of a data set into one of the predefined class labels. Banking system is one of the real-world domains, which collects huge number of client data on a daily basis. In this work, we have collected two variants of the bank marketing data set pertaining to a Portuguese financial institution consisting of 41188 and 45211 instances and performed classification on them using two data reduction techniques. Attribute subset selection has been performed on the first data set and the training data with the selected features are used in classification. Principal Component Analysis has been performed on the second data set and the training data with the extracted features are used in classification. A deep neural network classification algorithm based on Backpropagation has been developed to perform classification on both the data sets. Finally, comparisons are made on the performance of each deep neural network classifier with the four standard classifiers, namely Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, Support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. It has been found that the deep neural network classifier outperforms the existing classifiers in terms of accuracy. © BEIESP.","Attribute Subset Selection; Classification; Data Mining; Deep Neural Networks; Principal Component Analysis","","","","","","","","Krishna C.L., Reddy P.V.S., An Efficient Deep Neural Network Classifier in Banking System, International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews, 6, 2, pp. 511-517, (2019); Han J., Kamber M., Data Mining Concepts and Techniques, (2006); Dunhamm M.H., Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics, (2006); Lin C., Yan F., The Study on Classification and Prediction for Data Mining, Seventh Int’l Conf. on Measuring Technology and Mechatronics Automation, (2015); Alasadi A.S., Bhaya W.S., Review of Data Preprocessing Techniques in Data Mining, Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 12, 6, pp. 4102-4107, (2017); Frempong A.J., Jayabalan M., Predicting Customer Response to Bank Direct Telemarketing Campaign”, 2017 International Conference on Engineering Technology and Technopreneurship, IEEE, (2017); Mitik M., Korkmaz O., Karagoz P., Toroslu H.I., Yucel F., Data Mining based Product Marketing Technique for Banking Products”, 16<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, IEEE, (2016); Grzonka D., Suchacka G., Borowik B., Application of Selected Supervised Classification Methods To Bank Marketing Campaign, Information Systems in Management, 5, 1, pp. 36-48, (2016); Ruangthong P., Jaiyen S., Bank Direct Marketing Analysis of Asymmetric Information Based on Machine Learning,  International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2015); Elsalamony A.H., Bank Direct Marketing Analysis of Data Mining Techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 85, 7, (2014); Elsalamony A.H., Elsayad M.A., Bank Direct Marketing Based on Neural Network, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, 2, 6, (2013); Koc A.A., Yeniay O., A Comparative Study of Artificial Neural Networks and Logistic Regression For Classification of Marketing Campaign Results, Mathematical and Computational Applications, 18, 3, pp. 392-398, (2013); Wisaeng K., A Comparison of Different Classification Techniques for Bank Direct Marketing, International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering, 3, 4, (2013); Krishna C.L., Reddy P.V.S., Principal Component Analysis on Mixed Data For Deep Neural Network Classifier in Banking System, International Journal of Computer Sciences and Engineering, 7, 5, pp. 129-134, (2019); Gao T., Li X., Chai Y., Tang Y., Deep Learning with Stock Indicators and two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis for closing price prediction system, Seventh IEEE Int’l Conf.

H., Cheltenham, United Kingdom","Li S., Gloucestershire Business School, Cheltenham Gloucester Coll. H., Cheltenham, United Kingdom","In this paper, the development of a hybrid intelligent system for developing marketing strategy is described. The hybrid system has been developed to: provide a logical process for strategic analysis; support group assessment of strategic marketing factors; help the coupling of strategic analysis with managerial intuition and judgement; help managers deal with uncertainty and fuzziness; and produce intelligent advice on setting marketing strategy. In this system, the strengths of expert systems, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are combined to support the process of marketing strategy development. Moreover, the advantages of Porter's five forces model and the directional policy matrices (DPM) are also integrated to assist strategic analysis. In the paper, the software architecture of the hybrid system is discussed in details. Particularly, the group assessment support module, the fuzzification of strategic factors, and the fuzzy reasoning for setting marketing strategy are addressed. In addition, the empirical field work on evaluating the hybrid system is also summarized. The empirical evidence indicates that the hybrid intelligent system is helpful and useful in supporting the development of marketing strategy.","","Computer software; Expert systems; Fuzzy sets; Marketing; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Hybrid intelligent systems; Porter's five forces model; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Aiken M., Hawley D., Zhang W., Increasing meeting efficiency with a GDSS, Industrial Management and Data System, 94, 8, pp. 13-16, (1994); Aiken M., Vanjani M., Krosp J., Group decision support systems, Review of Business, 16, 3, pp. 38-42, (1995); Alpar P., Knowledge-based modelling of marketing managers' problem solving behaviour, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 8, pp. 5-16, (1991); Alavi M., Group decision support systems: A key to business team productivity, Journal of Information Systems Management, 8, 3, pp. 36-41, (1991); Amaravadi C., Samaddar S., Dutta S., Intelligent marketing information systems: Computerised intelligence for marketing decision making, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 13, 2, pp. 4-13, (1995); Belardo S., Duchessi P., Coleman J.R., A strategic decision support system at Orell Fussli, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10, 4, pp. 135-157, (1994); Borch O.J., Hartvigsen G., Knowledge-based systems for strategic market planning in small firms, Decision Support Systems, 7, 2, pp. 145-157, (1991); Borenstein D., Towards a practical method to validate decision support systems, Decision Support Systems, 23, pp. 227-239, (1998); Brownlie D., Spender J.C., Managerial judgement in strategic marketing: Some preliminary thoughts, Management Decision, 33, 6, pp. 39-50, (1995); Campbell L., Technology update: Group decision support systems, Journal of Accountancy, 170, 1, pp. 47-50, (1990); Carlsson C., Fuzzy logic and hyperknowledge: A new, effective paradigm for active DSS, Proceedings of HICSS-30, pp. 324-333, (1997); Carlsson C., Expert systems as conceptual frameworks and management support systems for strategic management, International Journal of Information Resources Management, 2, 4, pp. 14-22, (1991); Carlsson C., Kokkonen O., Walden P., Woodstrat: A support system for strategic management, Information Technology for Management Improving Quality and Productivity, pp. 148-154, (1996); Carlsson C., Walden P., Kokkonen O., Effective strategic management with hyperknowledge: The Woodstrat case, The Finnish Paper and Timber Journal, 78, 5, pp. 278-290, (1996); Day G.S., Analysis for Strategic Market Decisions, (1986); Desanctis G., Gallupe R.B., A foundation for the study of group decision support systems, Management Science, 33, 5, pp. 589-609, (1987); Dennis A.R., George J.F., Jessup L.M., Nunamaker J.F.

Design/methodology/approach: The technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical base and data were gathered from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN). Findings: The findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS. Practical implications: The findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development. Originality/value: The manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations. However, the associations between BDA and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs have been less explored. To address this issue, this study developed a theoretical model and examined the influence of BDA on SM and SO of manufacturing SMEs. Meanwhile, the hybrid methodological approach can help to uncover both linear and non-linear relationships better. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data adoption; SMEs; Sustainable marketing; Sustainable operations","","","","","","","","Abidin I.S.Z., Reflections on the Malaysian Economy Post-GE 14: Issues and Challenges, (2021); Al-Emran M., Abbasi G.A., Mezhuyev V., Evaluating the impact of knowledge management factors on M-learning adoption: a deep learning-based hybrid SEM-ANN approach, Recent Advances in Technology Acceptance Models and Theories, pp. 159-172, (2021); Al-Sai Z.A., Abdullah R., Husin M.H., Critical success factors for big data: a systematic literature review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 118940-118956, (2020); Asadi S., Abdullah R., Safaei M., Nazir S., An integrated SEM-Neural Network approach for predicting determinants of adoption of wearable healthcare devices, Mobile Information Systems, pp. 1-9, (2019); Auzzir Z., Haigh R., Amaratunga D., Impacts of disaster to SMEs in Malaysia, Procedia Engineering, 212, pp. 1131-1138, (2018); Baig M.I., Shuib L., Yadegaridehkordi E., Big data in education: a state of the art, limitations, and future research directions, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, pp. 1-23, (2020); Baig M.I., Shuib L., Yadegaridehkordi E., A model for decision-makers’ adoption of big data in the education sector, Sustainability, 13, 24, (2021); Bernama, Malaysian investment development authority, (2021); Chatterjee S., Chaudhuri R., Shah M., Maheshwari P., Big data driven innovation for sustaining SME supply chain operation in post COVID-19 scenario: moderating role of SME technology leadership, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 168, (2022); Chou S.F., Horng J.S., Liu C.H., Yu T.Y., Kuo Y.T., Identifying the critical factors for sustainable marketing in the catering: the influence of big data applications, marketing innovation, and technology acceptance model factors, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 51, pp. 11-21, (2022); Cohen J., A power primer, Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159, (1992); Du K.L., Clustering: a neural network approach, Neural Networks, 23, 1, pp. 89-107, (2010); El-Haddadeh R., Osmani M., Hindi N., Fadlalla A., Value creation for realising the sustainable development goals: fostering organisational adoption of big data analytics, Journal of Business Research, 131, pp. 402-410, (2021); Gangwar H., Understanding the determinants of big data adoption in India: an analysis of the manufacturing and services sectors, Information Resources Management Journal (IRMJ), 31, 4, pp. 1-22, (2018); Ghasemaghaei M., Does data analytics use improve firm decision making quality?

Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801217, 71872080, 72022007); Tsinghua University, THU, (2019THZWJC12)","The authors appreciate the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments.

The urgency of the research is determined, first of all, by the need for a constant dynamic correction of techniques and instrument management personnel in order to build an innovative culture of personnel management at domestic enterprises. When writing, analytical and statistical methods are used during the detection and processing of domestic and foreign statistical data, the method of expert assessments in the formation of structural models, historical and logical methods in the extrapolation of the state of the past years for the future. The article materials emphasize the definition and characteristics of the concept of «Innovative Culture of Personnel Management». It is determined that the practical implementation of the instrument of the personnel management of the enterprise needs to use innovative techniques. Among these techniques, it is crucial to underscore Gantt charts, the Dupon method and Game Theory, personal marketing management, and others. Particular attention is focused on a graphical display of a Gantt chart, which reflects the time interval from the time of decision-making on the introduction of innovative methods in managing personnel to increase labor productivity and the growth of other enterprise performance indicators. It is noted that when making decisions on the expediency of changing the existing personnel management culture at the enterprise, it is worth using neural network models based on which it is possible to reveal a causal relationship between the decision and the reaction of the entire organizational system or a separate personality. It is detected that one of the main methods of investigation of the probable results from the introduction of an innovative culture of personnel management at the enterprise is to identify strengths and weaknesses in the process of implementing changes. The study of the LIFT methodological approach that uses the tools of ballroom assessments of the groups of attractiveness indicators of decisions on introducing an innovative personnel management culture and indicators that determine their risks are distinguished. The probability and expediency of using GAP analysis for the comparative characteristics of actual and potential development opportunities are researched and analyzed. It is stated that the use of this information will distinguish at the expertise stage the possibility of practical implementation of an innovative culture tool in full or fragmented scope to determine the means and techniques that will give the greatest effect to develop the intellectual and labor potential of the enterprise. It is proposed to use GAP analysis when implementing an innovative personnel management culture for the restoration strategy and maintaining employees’ mental health, forcing the enterprise’s loyalty system, introducing the foundations of corporate and organizational culture of the enterprise. © Klipkova O., Kozmuk N., Kantsir I., Golub Н.","corporate culture; innovative culture of personnel management; mental health; personnel loyalty; personnel management","","","","","","","","Surowka-Marszalek D., Marketing.

This study sought to overcome these challenges by employing machine learning and hybrid models for vegetable crops. Machine learning techniques, known for their flexibility with non-stationary, non-normal, and non-linear data, were showcased in the empirical illustration, highlighting their effectiveness. The trends of arrivals and prices were found to be significantly positive (p<0.01) for tomato and capsicum. Time delay neural network (TDNN) and hybrid models outperformed the seasonal ARIMA models based on lower RMSE and MAPE for the modelling and forecasting. Utilizing the best-fit models, the prices of tomato and capsicum were forecasted to be highest during June 2024 with ₹2267 and 2623 per q. This study contributed to the growing body of applications of machine learning in agricultural systems. It will help develop a robust market intelligence mechanism to address uncertainties in agricultural markets. © 2024 The Society of Economics and Development, except certain content provided by third parties.","Market intelligence; neural networks; policy decisions; price forecasts","","","","","","","","Abbasi R., Martinez P., Ahmad R., The digitization of agricultural industry: Asystematic literature review on agriculture 4.0, Smart Agricultural Technology, 2, (2022); Amiri A., Bakhshoodeh M., Najafi B., Amiri A., Bakhshoodeh M., Najafi B., Forecasting seasonality in prices of potatoes and onions: Challenge between geostatistical models, neuro-fuzzy approach and winter method, (2011); Box G.E.P., Jenkins G.M., Time series analysis: Forecasting and control (Revised ed.), (1976); Brock W.A., Scheinkman J.A., Dechert W.D., LeBaron B., A test for independence based on the correlation dimension, Econometric Reviews, 15, 3, pp. 197-235, (1996); Darekar A., Reddy A.A., Price forecasting of maize in major states, Maize Journal, 6, pp. 1-5, (2017); Gajanana T.M., Shree K.L.S., Sharada P.S., Kumar S., Analysis of tomato prices in production and consumption markets in India: Policy imperatives, Indian Journal of Agricultural Marketing, 36, 1, pp. 110-131, (2022); Gupta A.K., Forecasting of arrivals and prices of pulses in Chhattisgarh: A statistical approach, (2018); Gupta A.K., Patra C., Singh A.K., Forecasting market prices of soybean in the Ujjain market (Madhya Pradesh), Green Farming, 10, 6, pp. 752-755, (2019); Gupta A.K., Rao V.S., Singh A.K., Forecasting of arrivals and prices of chickpea in Chhattisgarh, International Journal of Agriculture and Statistical Science, 14, 1, pp. 421-426, (2018); Gupta A.K., Sarkar K.A., Bhattacharya D., Dhakre D.S., Potato yield modelling based on meteorological factors using discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks, International Journal of Vegetable Science, 28, 5, pp. 465-476, (2022); Gupta A.K., Sarkar K., Dhakre D.S., Bhattacharya D., Weather-based crop yield prediction using artificial neural networks: A comparative study with other approaches, MAUSAM, 74, 3, pp. 825-832, (2023); Jaiswal R., Jha G.K., Kumar R.R., Choudhary K., Deep long short-term memory-based model for agricultural price forecasting, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 6, pp. 4661-4676, (2022); Jha G.K., Sinha K., Agricultural price forecasting using neural network model: An innovative information delivery system, Agricultural Economics Research Review, 26, 2, pp. 229-239, (2013); Khan Md.

Researchers have adopted various methods including statistical models and machine learning methods such as neural networks to assist decision making in direct marketing. However, due to the different performance criteria and validation techniques currently in practice, comparing different methods is often not straightforward. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the performance of neural networks with that of classification and regression tree, latent class models and logistic regression using three criteria - simple error rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and cumulative lift - and two validation methods, i.e. bootstrap and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Systematic experiments are conducted to compare their performance. Findings - The results suggest that these methods vary in performance across different criteria and validation methods. Overall, neural networks outperform the others in AUROC value and cumulative lifts, and the stratified ten-fold cross-validation produces more accurate results than bootstrap validation. Practical implications - To select predictive models to support direct marketing decisions, researchers need to adopt appropriate performance criteria and validation procedures. Originality/value - The study addresses the key issues in model selection, i.e. performance criteria and validation methods, and conducts systematic analyses to generate the findings and practical implications.","Database marketing; Direct marketing; Modelling; Neural nets; Performance criteria","","","","","","","","Adams N.M., Hand D.J., Improving the practice of classifier performance assessment, Neural Computation, 12, 2, pp. 305-311, (2000); Baesens B., Viaene S., van den Poel D., Vanthienen J., Dedene G., Bayesian neural network learning for repeat purchase modelling in direct marketing, European Journal of Operational Research, 138, 1, pp. 191-211, (2002); Baesens B., van Gestel T., Viaene S., Stepanova M., Suykens J., Vanthienen J., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 6, pp. 627-635, (2003); Berardi V.L., Zhang G.P., The effect of misclassification costs on neural network classifiers, Decision Sciences, 30, 3, pp. 659-682, (1999); Berger P., Magliozzi T., The effect of sample size and proportion of buyers in the sample on the performance of list segmentation equations generated by regression analysis, Journal of Direct Marketing, 6, 1, pp. 13-22, (1992); Bhattacharyva S., Direct marketing performance modeling using genetic algorithms, INFORMS Journal on Computing, 11, 3, pp. 2248-2257, (1999); Cooil B., Winer R.S., Rados D.L., Cross-validation for prediction, Journal of Marketing Research, 24, 3, pp. 271-279, (1987); Cui G., Wong M.L., Implementing neural networks for decision support in direct marketing, International Journal of Market Research, 46, 2, pp. 235-254, (2004); Efron B., Tibshirani R., An Introduction to the Bootstrap, (1993); Efron B., Tibshirani R., Improvements on cross-validation: The. 632+ bootstrap method, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 92, 438, pp. 548-560, (1997); Ho Y.-C., Pepyne D.L., Simple explanation of the no free lunch theorem of optimization, Cybernetics and Systems Analysis, 38, 2, pp. 292-298, (2002); Jain D., Bass F.M., Chen Y.-M., Estimation of latent class models with heterogeneous choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 27, 1, pp. 94-101, (1990); Kohavi R., A study of cross-validation and bootstrap for accuracy estimation and model selection, Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Joint Conference on AI, Montreal, (1995); Malthouse E.C., Assessing the performance of direct marketing scoring models, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 15, 1, pp. 49-62, (2001); Mitchell T., Machine Learning, (1997); Neal R.M., Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks, (1996); Peacock P.R., Data mining in marketing.

Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed statistical methods, such as regression or autoregressive and moving average (ARMA). However, sales forecasting is very complicated owing to influence by internal and external environments. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have also been applied in sales forecasting since their promising performances in the areas of control and pattern recognition. However, further improvement is still necessary since unique circumstances, e.g., promotion, cause a sudden change in the sales pattern. Thus, this study utilizes fuzzy logic a proposed fuzzy neural network (FNN) for the sake of learning fuzzy IF-THEN rules obtained from the marketing experts with respect to promotion. The result from FNN is further integrated with the forecast from ANN using the time series data and the promotion length through the other ANN. Model evaluation results indicate that the proposed system can more accurately perform than the conventional statistical method and single ANN. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Determination of attractive projects and markets where the competitive advantage of a company is high requires extensive environmental scanning, forecasting, and learning from the experience of competitors in international markets. In this paper, a neuronet model has been developed as a decision support tool that can classify international projects with respect to attractiveness and competitiveness based on the experiences of Turkish contractors in overseas markets. The model can be used to guide decision makers on which type of data should be collected during international business development and further help them to prepare priority lists during strategic planning. Information derived from the model demonstrates that the most important factors that increase attractiveness of an international project are availability of funds, market volume, economic prosperity, contract type, and country risk rating. Similarly, level of competition, attitude of host government, existence of strict quality requirements, country risk rating, and cultural/religious similarities are the most important factors that affect competitiveness of Turkish contractors in international markets.","Bids; Construction industry; Contractors; Foreign projects; Neural networks; Turkey","Competition; Construction industry; Decision making; Forecasting; International trade; Marketing; Mathematical models; Project management; Strategic planning; Bids; Contractors; Foreign projects; Turkey; Neural networks","","","","","","","Adeli H., Neural networks in civil engineering: 1989-2000, Comput.

A number of approaches have been developed to support this activity. This article reviews basic recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) methods on a set of data involving the sale of beef products. Variants of RFM are demonstrated. Classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks are also demonstrated. Results indicate a spectrum of tradeoffs. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. Considerations of balancing cell sizes as well as compressing data are examined. Both balancing expected cell densities as well as compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide more accurate models. Data mining algorithms were all found to provide a noticeable increase in predictive accuracy. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Customer segmentation; Decision tree models; Logistic regression; Neural networks; RFM","","","","","","","","Baesens B., Viaene S., van den Poel D., Vanthienen J., Dedene G., Bayesian neural network learning for repeat purchase modeling in direct marketing, Eur J Oper Res, 138, 1, pp. 191-211, (2002); Bult J.R., Wanskeek T., Optimal selection for direct mail, J Market Sci, 14, 4, pp. 378-394, (1995); Crone S.F., Lessmann S., Stahlbock R., The impact of preprocessing on data mining: An evaluation of classifier sensitivity in direct marketing, Eur J Oper Res, 173, 3, pp. 781-800, (2006); Cui G., Wong M.L., Lui H.-K., Machine learning for direct marketing response models: Bayesian networks with evolutionary programming, Manag Sci, 52, 4, pp. 597-612, (2006); D'souza R., Krasnodebski M., Abrahams A., Implementation study: Using decision tree induction to discover profitable locations to sell pet insurance for a startup company, J Database Market Custom Strategy Manag, 14, 4, pp. 281-288, (2007); Elsner R., Krafft M., Huchzemeier A., Optimizing Rhenania's mail-order business through dynamic multilevel modeling (DMLM), Interfaces, 33, 1, pp. 50-66, (2003); Fitzpatrick M., Statistical analysis for direct marketers-in plain English, Direct Market, 64, 4, pp. 54-56, (2001); Hoya T., On the capability of accommodating new classes within probabilistic neural networks, IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 14, 2, pp. 450-453, (2003); Jin X., Srinivasan D., Cheu R.L., Classification of freeway traffic patterns for incident detection using constructive probabilistic neural networks, IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 12, 5, pp. 1173-1187, (2001); Koonce D.A., Fang C.-H., Tsai S.-C., A data mining tool for learning from manufacturing systems, Comput Ind Eng, 33, 1-2, pp. 27-30, (1997); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Integrating AHP and data mining for product recommendation based on customer lifetime value, Inf Manag, 42, 3, pp. 387-400, (2005); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Hybrid approaches to product recommendation based on customer lifetime value and purchase preferences, J Syst Softw, 77, 2, pp. 181-191, (2005); Lo V.S.Y., The true lift model-a novel data mining approach to response modeling in database marketing, ACM SIGKDD, 4, 2, pp. 78-86, (2003); McCarty J.A., Hastak M., Segmentation approaches in data-mining: A comparison of RFM, CHAID, and logistic regression, J Bus Res, 60, 6, pp. 656-662, (2007); Miglautsch J., Application of RFM principles: What to do with 1-1-1 customers?, J Database Market, 9, 4, pp. 319-324, (2002); Olson D.L., Shih Y., Introduction to Business Data Mining, (2007); Shih Y.-Y., Liu C.-Y., A method for customer lifetime value ranking-combining the analytic hierarchy process and clustering analysis, Database Market Custom Strategy Manag, 11, 2, pp. 159-172, (2003); Specht D.F., Probabilistic neural networks, Neural Netw, 3, pp. 110-118, (1990); van den Berg B., Breur T., Merits of interactive decision tree building: Part 1, J Target Measur Anal Market, 15, 3, pp. 137-145, (2007); van den Berg B., Breur T., Merits of interactive decision tree building: Part 2: How to do it, J Target Measur Anal Market, 15, 4, pp. 201-209, (2007); Verhoef P.C., Spring P.N., Hoekstra J.C., Leeflang P.S.H., The commercial use of segmentation and predictive modeling techniques for database marketing in the Netherlands, Decis Support Syst, 34, 4, pp. 471-481, (2003); Weng S.S., Chiu R.-K., Wang B.-J., Su S.-H., The study and verification of a mathematical modeling for customer purchasing behavior, J Comput Inf Syst, 47, 2, pp. 46-57, (2006); Yang A.X., How to develop new approaches to RFM segmentation, J Target Measur Anal Market, 13, 1, pp. 50-60, (2004); Yun H., Ha D., Hwang B., Ryu K.H., Mining association rules on significant rare data using relative support, J Syst Softw, 67, pp. 181-191, (2003)","D.

Accordingly, this paper aims to present a new way for gauging customer loyalty and predicting their possibility of defection reference to a set of quality attributes satisfaction and three types of belief in the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/ approach - The performance of the classification utilization artificial neural networks (ANNs) was compared to that of traditional analytic tools, such as multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and classificatory data mining technique - decision tree. Findings - The analytical result represented that the predicted accuracy of ANNs is better then MDA and decision tree in both training and testing phases. Degree of repurchase intention has been classified correctly with a success rate of 83 percent using neural networks. Research limitations/implications - Like all research, this study has its limitations. One such limitation is that the predictive model was designed for application to online bookstores. A further limitation of this survey is that it reflects intentions instead of actual behavior. Finally, despite of ANNs has been applied to numerous areas and have demonstrated a degree of classification success, it is difficult to extract rules for explanation. Therefore, enhancing ability of model explanation would be a valuable work in the future. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is to predict how marketing practitioners can tactically market to customers with weak repurchase intentions to prevent defections. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer satisfaction;

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is related to contextual mining of texts which helps in identification and extraction of subjective information from the source material. Sentiment analysis is being used for brand monitoring and reputation management across different market segments. It helps to understand how the public perceive a particular brand, product or service that is highly useful for different tech companies, marketing agencies, media organizations, fashion brands etc. In today’s scenario we have been suffering with data overload which makes it impossible to analyze public sentiments without any sort of error or bias. Sentiment analysis provides better insights into the public reviews as it can be automated which ultimately helps in decision making. There are various deep learning and machine learning methods and models as well as natural language processing tools which help in examining and analyzing public opinions with low time complexity. However, deep learning methods have become highly popular in recent times as these models provide high efficiency and accuracy. In this review paper we have provided a complete overview of the common deep learning frameworks being employed for sentiment classification and analysis. This paper discusses various learning models, evaluation, text representations and other metrics in deep learning architectures. The key findings of different authors have been discussed in detail. This paper will help other researchers in understanding the deep learning techniques being used for sentiment analysis. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep learning; Deep Neural networks (DNN); Machine learning; Natural Language Processing; Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN); Sentiment Analysis","","","","","","","","Abdelgwad M.

This information is valuable as it enables the identification of the area/part of the picture that attracts people's attention, which can be used as a consideration when making decisions in the future, for example in marketing. For this reason, in this study, a Neural Network (NN) model was developed to predict the fixation points of a picture.

The results show that the method used is applicable in practice since it produces MAPE (Mean Absolute Percent Error) of around 13-15% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) of 0.9-1.1%. © IJTech 2017.","Eye tracking; Fixation points; MAPE; MSE; Neural network","","","","","","Directorate of Research and Community Engagement; Universitas Indonesia, UI","This study was financially supported by Hibah PITTA 2017 from the Directorate of Research and Community Engagement, Universitas Indonesia.","Bang H., Wojdynski B.W., Tracking Users' Visual Attention and Responses to Personalized Advertising based on Task Cognitive Demand, Computers in Human Behavior, 55, pp. 867-876, (2015); Bhardwaj A., Tiwari A., Bhardwaj H., Bhardwaj A., A Genetically Optimized Neural Network Model for Multi-class Classification, Expert Systems With Applications, 60, pp. 211-221, (2016); Chai T., Draxler R.R., Root mean square error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE)?-Arguments against avoiding RMSE in the literature, Geoscientific Model Development, 7, pp. 1247-1250, (2014); de Myttenaere A., Golden B., Le Grand B., Rossi F., Mean Absolute Percentage Error for Regression Models, Neurocomputing, 192, pp. 38-48, (2015); Drewes H., Eye Gaze Tracking for Human Computer Interaction, (2010); Duchowski A., Eye Tracking Methodology-Theory and Practice, (2007); Kenyon R.V., A Soft Contact Lens Search Coil for Measuring Eye Movements, Vision Research, 25, 11, pp. 1629-1633, (1985); Schall A., Bergstrom J.R., Eye Tracking in User Experience Design, (2014); Sharma B., Venugopalan K., Comparison of Neural Network Training Functions for Hematoma Classification in Brain CT Images, IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering, 16, 1, pp. 31-35, (2014); Simola J., Salojrvi J., Kojo I., Using Hidden Markov Model to Uncover Processing States from Eye Movements in Information Search Tasks, Cognitive Systems Research, 9, pp. 237-251, (2008); Zhong M., Xinbo Z., Xiao-chun Z., Wang J.Z., Wenhu W., Markov Chain Based Computational Visual Attention Model that Learns from Eye Tracking Data, Pattern Recognition Letters, 49, pp. 1-10, (2014)","B.N.

These models can be used as a market response simulator for simulating marketing strategies and assessing how changes in marketing variables such as pricing and promotions will influence consumer behavior and thus perform 'what-if' simulations. So a reliable and relevant brand choice model can be very useful and effective, which, in fact, represents a worthwhile opportunity to improve the efficiency of the marketing decisions. In this paper we offer a new approach by integrating of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Data preprocessing for brand choice modeling and constructing a market response simulator. This approach, called Preprocessed-Probabilistic Neural Network (PPNN), consists of two main stages. First, a robust Genetic Based Instance Selection Model (GBIS) employed to look for a representative data subset of instances in training data set. The second stage ends up with a relevant brand choice model, using a probabilistic neural network trained by Dynamic Decay Adjustment Algorithm (DDA). The evaluation process is carried out using the same data set been used in literature for modeling individual consumer choices in a retail coffee market. The evaluation results show that the offered approach outperforms all previous methods, so it can be considered as an effective tool for consumer behavior modeling and simulation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The availability of vaccines does not always mean utilization. This is because, people have less confidence in vaccines, which resulted in vaccination hesitancy and developing global decline in vaccine intake and has caused viral disease outbreaks worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to understand people’s perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine to help the manufacturing companies of the vaccine to improve their marketing strategy based on the rejection causes. In this paper, we used multi-class Sentiment Analysis to classify people’s opinions from extracted tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, using firstly different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and secondly various Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNN-LSTM and RNN-GRU. Then, we investigated the analysis of the negative tweets to identify the causes of rejection using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Finally, we classified these negative tweets according to the rejection causes for all the vaccines using the same selected ML and DL models. The result of SA showed that DT gives the best performance with an accuracy of 92.26% and for DL models, GRU achieved 96.83%. Then, we identified five causes: Lack of safety, Side effect, Production problem, Fake news and Misinformation, and Cost. Furthermore, for the classification of the negative tweets according to the identified rejection causes, the LR achieved the best result with an accuracy of 89.97%. For DL models, the LSTM model showed the best result with an accuracy of 91.66%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19 vaccines; Deep learning; GRU-LSTM; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine rejection causes","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Health risks; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Nearest neighbor search; Sentiment analysis; Statistics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Vaccines; COVID-19 vaccine; Deep learning; Gated recurrent unit-long short term memory; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Learning models; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Opinion analysis; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine rejection cause; COVID-19","","","","","","","Akarsu B., Canbay Ozdemir D., Ayhan Baser D., Aksoy H., Fidanci I., Cankurtaran M., While studies on covid-19 vaccine is ongoing, the public’s thoughts and attitudes to the future covid-19 vaccine, Int J Clin Pract, 75, (2020); Aljameel S.S., Alabbad D.A., Alzahrani N.A., Alqarni S.M., Alamoudi F.A., Babili L.M., Aljaafary S.K., Alshamrani F.M., A sentiment analysis approach to predict an individual’s awareness of the precautionary procedures to prevent covid-19 outbreaks in saudi arabia, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 18, 1, (2021); Anis E., Preis S.A., Cedar N., Tal Y., Hershkowitz I., Hershko A.Y., Reporting of allergic reactions during Pfizer-Biontech bntt162b2 vaccination in Israel, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 10, 11, pp. 2969-2976, (2022); Bell S., Clarke R., Mounier-Jack S., Walker J.L., Paterson P., Parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future covid-19 vaccine: a multi-methods study in england, Vaccine, 38, 49, pp. 7789-7798, (2020); Chandra Y., Jana A., Sentiment analysis using machine learning and deep learning, 2020 7Th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (Indiacom), pp. 1-4, (2020); Dror A.A., Eisenbach N., Taiber S., Morozov N.G., Mizrachi M., Zigron A., Srouji S., Sela E., Vaccine hesitancy: the next challenge in the fight against Covid-19, Eur J Epidemiol, 35, 8, pp. 775-779, (2020); Dubey A.D., Public sentiment analysis of covid-19 vaccination drive in India, (2021); Jain P.K., Pamula R., A Systematic Literature Review on Machine Learning Applications for Consumer Sentiment Analysis Using Online Reviews, (2020); Journal T.W.S., Vaccine Manufacturing Issues Force Moderna to Cut Supplies to Canada, (2021); Kang G.J., Ewing-Nelson S.R., Mackey L., Schlitt J.T., Marathe A., Abbas K.M., Swarup S., Semantic network analysis of vaccine sentiment in online social media, Vaccine, 35, 29, pp. 3621-3638, (2017); Mahajan R., Romine W., Miller M., Banerjee T., Analyzing public outlook towards vaccination using twitter, 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 2763-2772, (2019); Mascellino M.T., Di Timoteo F., de Angelis M., Oliva A., Overview of the main anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines: Mechanism of action, efficacy and safety, Infection and Drug Resistance, pp. 3459-3476, (2021); Mostafa L., Machine learning-based sentiment analysis for analyzing the travelers reviews on egyptian hotels, Joint European-Us Workshop on Applications of Invariance in Computer Vision, pp. 405-413, (2020); Murphy J., Vallieres F., Bentall R.P., Shevlin M., McBride O., Hartman T.K., McKay R., Bennett K., Mason L., Gibson-Miller J., Et al., Psychological characteristics associated with Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in Ireland and the united kingdom, Nat Commun, 12, 1, pp. 1-15, (2021); NCT04283461 C (2020) Safety and Immunogenicity Study of 2019-Ncov Vaccine (Mrna-1273) for Prophylaxis Sars Cov-2 Infection.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of customer background information followed by logistic regression analysis of response behavior is commonly used by database marketers. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) guided by genetic algorithms (GAs) to target households. We show that the resulting selection rule is more accurate and more parsimonious than the PCA/logit rule when the manager has a clear decision criterion. Under vague decision criteria, the new procedure loses its advantage in interpretability, but is still more accurate than PCA/logit in targeting households. ©2005 INFORMS.","Customer relationship management; Database marketing; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks","Customer satisfaction; Data acquisition; Decision theory; Genetic algorithms; Industrial management; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Customer relationship management; Database marketing; Demographies; Micromarketing; Marketing","","","","","","","Ahalt S.C., Krishnamurthy A.K., Chen P., Melton D.E., Competitive learning algorithms for vector quantization, Neural Networks, 3, pp. 277-290, (1990); Balakrishnan P.V.S., Cooper M.C., Jacob V.S., Lewis P.A., Comparative performance of the FSCL neural net and K-means algorithm for market segmentation, Eur.

Zhejiang Province, a key province in China, has proactively implemented and monitored an environmental protection plan. This study aims to contribute toward streamlining marketing and planning activities to introduce strategic policies that stimulate the purchase and use of BEVs. This study considers the nature of human behavior by extending the theory of planned behavior model to identify its predictors, as well as its non-linear relationship with customers' purchase intention. To better understand the predictors, a substantial literature review was given to validate the hypotheses. A quantitative study using 382 surveys completed by customers in Zhejiang Province was conducted by integrating a structural equation model (SEM) and a neural network (NN). The initial analysis results from the SEM revealed five factors that have impacted the customers' purchase intention of BEVs. In the second phase, the normalized importance among those five significant predictors was ranked using the NN. The findings have provided theoretical implications to scholars and academics, and managerial implications to enterprises, and are also helpful for decision makers to implement appropriate policies to promote the purchase intention of BEVs, thereby improving the air quality. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery electric vehicles; Neural network; Purchase intention; Structural equation model; Theory of planned behavior","China; Zhejiang; artificial neural network; decision making; electric vehicle; environmental protection; human behavior; integrated approach; literature review; model; perception; policy implementation; strategic approach; traffic emission","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51475410, 51875503, 71840014)","Author Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.X.

It is vital to understand how small businesses, like restaurants, use this real-time data to make better-informed business operation decisions in this mobile marketing era. Using data collected from Foursquare, a leading location-based service provider, and Yelp, we aim to find out the predictive power of customer checkins on business failure of restaurants in New York City by using several predictive modeling techniques, such as Neural Network, Logit model and K-nearest neighbor. Our findings are encouraging. The customer checkin data from both a focal restaurant and its neighbors have shown strong predictive power on business failure. Compared to the baseline model in which we only use business characteristic variables to predict failure, incorporating the checkin data captured from location-based services gives a remarkable improvement on predictive accuracy. Our findings provide the foundation for future studies on the predictive power of information obtained from location-based services on business operations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","K-nearest neighbor; Location-based services; Logit model; Neural network; Predictive modeling","Encoding (symbols); Error analysis; Knowledge based systems; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Plant shutdowns; Sales; Telecommunication services; Business failure; Business operation; K-nearest neighbors; Logit modeling; Mobile marketing; Predictive accuracy; Predictive modeling; Predictive power; Location based services","","","","","","","Akaike H., Fitting autoregressions for prediction, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 21, pp. 243-247, (1969); Altman E.I., Finacial ratios.

Incorrect disposal practices can lead to pharmacopollution, which poses significant risks to environmental integrity and human well-being. Involving medicine users in waste management empowers them to take responsibility for their waste and make informed decisions to safeguard the environment and public health. The objective of this research was to contribute to the prevention of pharmacopollution by identifying influential factors that promote responsible disposal practices among medicine users. Factors such as attitude, marketing campaigns, collection points, safe handling, medical prescription, package contents, and public policies and laws were examined. To analyze the complex relationships and interactions among these factors, a dual-staged approach was employed, utilizing advanced statistical modeling techniques and deep learning artificial neural network algorithms. Data were collected from 952 respondents in Pernambuco, a state in northeastern Brazil known for high rates of pharmacopollution resulting from improper disposal of household medical waste. The results of the study indicated that the propositions related to safety in handling and medical prescription were statistically rejected in the structural equation modeling (SEM) model. However, in the artificial neural network (ANN) model, these two propositions were found to be important predictors of cooperative behavior, highlighting the ANN’s ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between variables. The findings emphasize the significance of user cooperation and provide insights for the development of effective strategies and policies to address pharmacopollution. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; consumer behavior; deep learning; home waste medicine; pharmacopollution; structural equation modeling","Brazil; Pernambuco; artificial neural network; consumption behavior; environmental factor; exploration; machine learning; medicine; numerical model; waste management","","","","","Fundação Antônio dos Santos Abranches; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (Code/001); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","Funding text 1: This study was funded by Fundação Antônio dos Santos Abranches and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—(Grant Code/001).; Funding text 2: This work was partially supported by Fundação Antônio dos Santos Abranches and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior.

Broadly speaking, reviews rated by consumers as more helpful exert a greater influence downstream. The current research examines how the linguistic characteristics of a review affect its helpfulness score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), this research analyzes the linguistic subjectivity and objectivity of over 2 million reviews on Amazon. The results show that, ceteris paribus, both linguistic subjectivity and objectivity have a positive impact on review helpfulness. However, contrary to consumers' intuition, when subjectivity and objectivity are combined in the same review, review helpfulness increases less than their respective separate effects would predict, especially for hedonic products. We conceptualize that this results from the increased complexity of messages mixing subjective and objective sentences, which requires more effortful processing. The findings extend the literature on online reviews, word-of-mouth, and text analysis in marketing, and offer practical implications for marketing communication and facilitation of reviews. © 2023 Society for Consumer Psychology.","neural network; online reviews; subjectivity; text analysis; word-of-mouth","","","","","","","","Alba J.W., Williams E.F., Pleasure principles: A review of research on hedonic consumption, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 23, 1, pp. 2-18, (2013); Batra R., Ahtola O.T., Measuring the hedonic and utilitarian sources of consumer attitudes, Marketing Letters, 2, 2, pp. 159-170, (1991); Becker M., Wiegand N., Reinartz W.J., Does it pay to be real?

However, the abundance of user-generated content data makes it challenging to analyze and derive insights from it. As a result, the demand for sentiment analysis research has increased. This work intends to highlight the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis through a bibliometric analysis. To our knowledge, bibliometric research of sentiment analysis on user-generated content has never been conducted. The research methodology adopted for this study was essentially divided into four phases. Those phases include data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis and report writing. This bibliometric research successfully identified the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis. This study will give a baseline for future researchers to start another study. Big data, text analytics, text mining, tourism, covid-19, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, making predictions, and marketing decisions are among the most recent research interests for sentiment analysis of user-generated content. However, there is a lack of research on those particular topics. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

A combination of qualitative simulation and empirical study can serve as a solution to the optimization problem. Firstly, we use mobile banking system as an example with questionnaire designed to obtain data from customers, which is then statistically analyzed using SPSS to examine the interactions among adoption drivers. Secondly, a qualitative simulation method is introduced to drive the evolution of the interactions among these adoption drivers. Thirdly, according to the empirical relations, an optimization model is established, and the objective functions are examined by the BP neural network. Then, to examine the feasibility of the framework, a prototype system based on MATLAB is implemented. It is found that the results are consistent with common sense (oscillation-equilibrium theory), and the framework is able to contribute to real-time optimization decision supports in the mobile banking marketing. In practice, the identification of the optimal combination of change directions can serve as the development priorities in adoption drivers, and is likely to influence resource allocation in the future mobile banking development. © JASSS.","BP neural network; Empirical study; Mobile banking adoption; Optimization; QSIM","","","","","","","","""Survey Report on Mobile Banking Adoption in China 2011, (2011); ""Bank of China 2011 Annual Report, (2011); ""Bank of Communications 2011 Annual Report, (2011); ""War of the mobile banking: A comparison of competitiveness among mobile banks, (2010); Berends R., Romme G., Simulation as a Research Tool in Management Studies, European Management Journal, 17, 6, pp. 576-583, (1999); Berndsen R., Causal Ordering in Economic Models, Decision Support Systems, 15, pp. 157-165, (1995); Berndsen R., Daniels H., Causal reasoning and explanation in dynamic economic systems, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 18, pp. 251-271, (1994); Bruner G.C., Kumar A., Explaining consumer acceptance of handheld internet devices, Journal of Business Research, 58, 5, pp. 553-558, (2005); Campbell D., Frei F., Cost structure, customer profitability, and retention implications of self-service distribution channels: Evidence from customer behavior in an online banking channel, Management Science, 56, 1, pp. 4-24, (2010); Cem Say A.C., Akyn H.L., Sound and complete qualitative simulation is impossible, Artificial Intelligence, 149, pp. 251-266, (2003); Chang Y.T., Dynamics of banking technology adoption: An application to Internet banking.

Recently, neural network modelling has received increasing attention and has been applied to an array of marketing problems such as market response or segmentation. We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Logit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Logit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Logit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics. The method is illustrated on an artificial dataset where the market is heterogeneous. We then apply the approach to panel scanner data of purchase records, using the Logit to analyse the non-linearities detected by the neural network.

Data mining methods provides the insurance industry with numerous advantages: shorter data processing times, more sophisticated methods for more accurate data analysis, better decision-making, etc. Insurance companies use data mining methods for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to fraud prevention. The process of insurance premium pricing was one of the first applications of data mining methods in insurance industry. The application of the data mining method in this paper aims to improve the results in the process of non-life insurance premium ratemaking. The improvement is reflected in the choice of predictors or risk factors that have an impact on insurance premium rates. The following data mining methods for the selection of prediction variables were investigated: Forward Stepwise, Decision trees and Neural networks. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used for premium ratemaking, as the main statistical model for non-life insurance premium pricing today in most developed insurance markets in the world. © 2020, University of Rijeka.

Some companies employ expert writers to fabricate reviews or use automated techniques to improve the appeal of their products or services, or to undermine the credibility of their rivals. This obstructs the detection of fake reviews and reviewers. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network-based framework for detecting spammers, who originate fake reviews in discussion forums to capture information from different social network combinations in various subgraphs. These subgraphs include a complete social context graph, homogeneous user–user subgraph, and heterogeneous user–post subgraph. A novel two-stage architecture with focal loss was designed to create a training model. This model can be applied to solve the issue of imbalance data classification. The proposed framework was applied to evaluate a ground truth dataset collected from an actual fraudulent review event on a discussion forum. The experimental results show that this aggregate social context representation method can be effectively applied to detect fake reviewers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","eWOM marketing; Fake review detection; Graph neural network; Social context","Graph neural networks; Discussion forum; EWOM marketing; Fake review detections; Graph neural networks; Mobile web; Neural network method; Social context; Social media; Subgraphs; Web technologies; Fake detection","","","","","National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (109-2410-H-027-009-MY2, 110-2622-H-027-001, 111-2410-H-027-011-MY3)","This study was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan under grants 109-2410-H-027-009-MY2 , 110-2622-H-027-001 and 111-2410-H-027-011-MY3.

By extending and refining previous work, this study examines the usefulness of perceived risk theory to understand consumers' behaviour in one of the most common holiday experiences, the package holiday. Unlike other studies, this research undertakes a more detailed assessment of the risks involved, as well as examining how consumers reduce those risks. Forty-three risky attributes and fifteen risk reducers were identified and a neural network analysis uncovered a relationship between risk and risk reduction which involved functional, financial and hotel dominated risks, whilst the relationship between risk and purchase intention was mediated by trust in the tour operator and anxiety.

More specifically, we provide evidence that Facebook data can be used as a valuable data source for nonprofit organizations in acquiring new donors. To do so, we evaluate three different dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e., singular value decomposition, non-negative matrix factorization, and latent Dirichlet allocation) over seven classification techniques (i.e., logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, bagged trees, random forest, adaboost, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks) using five times twofold cross-validation. Next, we assess what type of Facebook data and which predictors are most important. The results indicate that we can predict first-time donation behavior based on Facebook data with high predictive performance. Our benchmark indicates that the combination of singular value decomposition and logistic regression outperforms all other analytical methodologies with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.72 and a top decile lift of 3.33. The results show that Facebook pages and categories of Facebook pages are the most important data types. The most important predictors are dimensions related to age, education, residence, materialism, responsible consumption, and interest in nonprofits. The presented acquisition models can be used by nonprofit organizations to implement a one-to-one targeted marketing campaign towards Facebook fans. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to determine the predictive value of Facebook data for nonprofits in a real-life acquisition context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CRM; Customer acquisition; Facebook; Predictive analytics; Social media","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Dimensionality reduction; Factorization; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Marketing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Singular value decomposition; Social networking (online); Statistics; Analytical methodology; Classification technique; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Predictive performance; Receiver operating characteristics; Two-fold-cross-validation; Nonprofit organization","","","","","","","Alpaydin E., Combined 5× 2 cv F test for comparing supervised classification learning algorithms, Neural Comput., 11, 8, pp. 1885-1892, (1999); Althoff T., Leskovec J., Donor retention in online crowdfunding communities: A case study of donorschoose. org, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 34-44, (2015); Bachrach Y., Kosinski M., Graepel T., Kohli P., Stillwell D., Personality and patterns of Facebook usage, Proceedings of the 4th Annual ACM Web Science Conference, pp. 24-32, (2012); Baesens B., Van Gestel T., Viaene S., Stepanova M., Suykens J., Vanthienen J., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, J.

While CRM nirvana is the attainment of profitable one-to-one relationships, current activity is concentrated on segmentation. As technology has moved segmentation from simple classification towards more complex predictive modelling, the use of CRM analytic suites comprising statistical techniques such as decision trees, neural networks and cluster analysis is increasing. It is suggested that the subjective nature of cluster analysis may be overlooked when the technique is integrated with other 'tools' into a data-mining package and, consequently, that inadequately tested cluster analysis solutions may be contributing to CRM dissatisfaction. This paper reports the findings of a study which subjected a data set designed for segmentation purposes to a series of rigorous validity and reliability tests and went as far as to randomise the data to ascertain whether current methods could detect 'false' data. The study shows, alarmingly, that under certain conditions random data can 'pass' standard tests and highlights just how meticulously and thoroughly cluster analysis solutions must be tested before they can be safely used in formulating marketing strategy. Practical, theoretical and technical advice is offered for managers working with CRM analytics suites and avenues suggested for future research into improved CRM performance through effective management of the IT/marketing interface.","","","","","","","","","Aldenderfer M.S., Blashfield R.K., Cluster Analysis, (1984); Bird D., Common Sense Direct Marketing, (2000); Broadbent M., Crick T., Market research and database marketing - Exploiting overlaps to add value to the business, The Marriage of Market Research and Database Marketing Conference, (1999); Brown S., Postmodern Marketing, (1995); Brown S., Post Modern Marketing Two: Telling Tales, (1998); Brown S., The Route to Strategic Customer Care, (1999); Chaturvedi A., Carroll J.D., Green P.E., Rotondo J.A., A feature-based approach to market segmentation via overlapping K-centroids clustering, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 370-377, (1997); Cova B., Community and consumption: Towards a definition of the 'linking value' of product or services, European Journal of Marketing, 31, 3-4, pp. 297-316, (1997); Dibb S., New millenium, new segments: Moving towards a segment of one?, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 9, 3, pp. 193-213, (2001); Dibb S., Criteria guiding segmentation implementation: Reviewing the evidence, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 7, 2, pp. 107-129, (1999); Dibb S., Simkin L., Market segmentation: Diagnosing and treating the barriers, Industrial Marketing Management, 30, 8, pp. 609-626, (2001); Dibb S., Stern P., Questioning the reliability of market segmentation techniques, Omega, International Journal of Management Science, 23, 6, pp. 625-636, (1995); Durman P., Goodbye yuppies: Hello L-plate lads and new traditionalists, The Sunday Times, (2001); Eckerson W., Watson H., Harnessing Customer Information for Strategic Advantage: Technical Challenges and Business Solutions, Industry Study 2000, (2001); Edelstein H., Building profitable customer relationships with data mining, SPSS Executive Briefing, (2002); Everitt B.S., Cluster Analysis, (1993); Firat A.F., Venkatesh A., Postmodernity: The age of marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 10, 2, pp. 227-249, (1993); Firat A.F., Schulz J.

The literature has introduced the individual-level and the segment-based predictive modeling approaches for this purpose. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and performs in certain cases. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach which predicts customers’ individual purchase behaviors and reduces the limitations of these two methods by combining the advantages of them. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hybrid approach is established based on individual-level and segment-based approaches and utilizes the historical transactional data and predictive algorithms to generate predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in the domain of supermarket shopping by using real-world data and using five popular machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests. Findings: A comparison of results shows that the proposed hybrid approach substantially outperforms the individual-level and the segment-based approaches in terms of prediction coverage while maintaining roughly comparable prediction accuracy to the individual-level method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that logistic regression performs better than the other classifiers in predicting customer purchase behavior. Practical implications: The study concludes that the proposed approach would be beneficial for enterprises in terms of designing customized services and one-to-one marketing strategies. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to adopt a hybrid approach combining individual-level and segment-based approaches to predict customers’ individual purchase behaviors. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer behavior models;

The impetus for businesses to use corporate social responsibility (CSR) is evident, but the effects of CSR motives on corresponding processes underlying cause-related marketing (CRM) patronage intention have not been thoroughly examined. This study, anchored on attribution theory, established a research model that better explains the influence of CSR motives on patronage intentions toward CRM-oriented online retailers. Additionally, this study aims to examine the moderating role of spirituality (SPT) on CSR motives and CRM patronage intention (CPI). Design/methodology/approach: Primary data has been collected from 722 respondents and analyzed by using deep neural-network architecture by using the innovative PLS-SEM-ANN method to predict/rank the factors impacting CPI. Findings: The results revealed the normalized importance of the predictors of CPI and found that value-driven motive was the strongest predictor, followed by strategic motive, SPT, age and stakeholder-driven motive. In contrast, egoistic motive, education and income were found insignificant. Originality/value: The pandemic has transformed the way consumers shop and fortified the online economy, thereby resulting in a paradigm shift toward usage of e-commerce platforms. The results offer valuable insights to online retailers and practitioners for predicting patronage intentions by CSR motives and, thus, effectively engage CRM consumers by designing promotions in a way that would deeply resonate with them. This study assessed and predicted the factors influencing the CPI s, thereby guiding the online retailers to design CSR strategies and manage crucial CRM decisions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cause-related marketing; CRM patronage intentions; CSR motives; PLS-SEM-ANN; Spirituality","","","","","","","","Abu-Mostafa Y.S., Hints, Neural Computation, 7, 4, pp. 639-671, (1995); Al-Shihi H., Sharma S.K., Sarrab M., Neural network approach to predict mobile learning acceptance, Education and Information Technologies, 23, 5, pp. 1805-1824, (2018); Amawate V., Deb M., Antecedents and consequences of consumer skepticism toward cause-related marketing: gender as moderator and attitude as mediator, Journal of Marketing Communications, 27, 1, pp. 31-52, (2021); Astrachan J.H., Binz Astrachan C., Campopiano G., Bau M., Values, spirituality and religion: family business and the roots of sustainable ethical behavior, Journal of Business Ethics, 163, pp. 637-645, (2020); Becker-Olsen K.L., Cudmore B.A., Hill R.P., The impact of perceived corporate social responsibility on consumer behaviour, Journal of Business Research, 59, 1, pp. 46-53, (2006); Ben-Shabat H., Kearney A.T., Analysis of emerging market retailing through 2030 shows $5.5 trillion gap between best- and worst-case scenarios, (2016); Bhattacharya C.B., Sen S., Doing better at doing good: when, why, and how consumers respond to corporate social initiatives, California Management Review, 47, 1, pp. 9-24, (2004); Bhatti H.Y., Galan-Ladero M.M., Galera-Casquet C., Cause-related marketing: a systematic review of the literature, International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing, 20, 1, pp. 25-64, (2022); Bigne-Alcaniz E., Curras-Perez R., Sanchez-Garcia I., Brand credibility in cause‐related marketing: the moderating role of consumer values, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 18, 6, pp. 437-447, (2009); Brown T.J., Dacin P.A., The company and the product: corporate associations and consumer product responses, Journal of Marketing, 61, 1, pp. 68-84, (1997); Chan F.T., Chong A.Y., A SEM–neural network approach for understanding determinants of interorganizational system standard adoption and performances, Decision Support Systems, 54, 1, pp. 621-630, (2012); Chen C., How to shop with AmazonSmile and earn donations to charity, (2022); Chou C.P., Bentler P.M., Estimates and tests in structural equation modelling, Structural Structural Equation Modeling: Issues, Concepts, and Applications, pp. 37-55, (1995); Dawkins J., Lewis S., CSR in stakeholder expectations: and their implication for company strategy, Journal of Business Ethics, 44, 2, pp. 185-193, (2003); Deb M., Sharma V.K., Amawate V., CRM, skepticism and patronage intention—the mediating and moderating role of satisfaction and religiosity, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 29, 4, pp. 316-336, (2021); Diddi S., Niehm L.S., Corporate social responsibility in the retail apparel context: exploring consumers' personal and normative influences on patronage intentions, Journal of Marketing Channels, 23, 1-2, pp. 60-76, (2016); Ellen P.S., Webb D.J., Mohr L.A., Building corporate associations: consumer attributions for corporate socially responsible programs, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34, 2, pp. 147-157, (2006); Elving W.J.L., CSR and skepticism: the influence of fit and reputation on skepticism towards CSR communication, Proceedings of the Conference on Corporate Communication, New York, NY, Corporate Communication International at Baruch College/CUNY, pp. 63-77, (2010); Forehand M.R., Grier S., When is honesty the best policy?

However, the pricing of leases is complicated because the leasing rate must embody an expectation of the car's residual value after contract expiration. This paper develops resale price forecasting models in order to aid pricing decisions. One feature of the leasing business is that different forecast errors entail different costs. The primary objective of this paper is to identify effective ways of addressing cost asymmetry. Specifically, this paper contributes to the literature by (i) consolidating prior work in forecasting on asymmetric functions of the cost of errors; (ii) systematically evaluating previous approaches and comparing them to a new approach; and (iii) demonstrating that forecasting using asymmetric cost of error functions improves the quality of decision support in car leasing. For example, if the costs of overestimating resale prices are twice those of underestimating them, incorporating cost asymmetry into forecast model development reduces costs by about 8%. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters","Asymmetric cost of error; Automotive industry; Ensemble learning; Neural networks; Quantile regression","","","","","","","","Berk R., Asymmetric loss functions for forecasting in criminal justice settings, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 27, pp. 107-123, (2011); Bharadwaj A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bishop C.M., Neural networks for pattern recognition, (1997); Brown G., Wyatt J., Harris R., Yao X., Diversity creation methods: A survey and categorisation, Information Fusion, 6, pp. 5-20, (2005); Caruana R., Munson A., Niculescu-Mizil A., Getting the most out of ensemble selection, Proceedings of the 6th international conference on data mining, pp. 828-833, (2006); Caruana R., Niculescu-Mizil G., Crew G., Ksikes A., Ensemble selection from libraries of models, Proceedings of the 21st international conference on machine learning, pp. 18-25, (2004); Christoffersen P., Diebold F.X., Optimal prediction under asymmetric loss, Econometric Theory, 13, pp. 808-817, (1997); Crone S.F., Training artificial neural networks for time series prediction using asymmetric cost functions, Proceedings of the 9th international conference on neural information processing, pp. 2374-2380, (2002); Crone S.; Crone S.F., Hibon M., Nikolopoulos K., Advances in forecasting with neural networks?

Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods","","","","","","","","Birant D, Data mining using RFM analysis, Knowledge-oriented applications in data mining (IntechOpen), (2011); Chang CJ, A Decision Support System for Audit Staff Scheduling of Multiple and Large-Scaled Engagements, Rev Bus Inf Syst, 6, pp. 27-40, (2002); De Haan E, Wiesel T, Pauwels K, The effectiveness of different forms of online advertising for purchase conversion in a multiple-channel attribution framework, Int J Res Mark, 33, pp. 491-507, (2016); Dodin B, Huang Chan K, Application of production scheduling methods to external and internal audit scheduling, Eur J Oper Res, 52, pp. 267-279, (1991); Edvardsson B, Gustafsson A, Roos I, Service portraits in service research: a critical review, International J Serv Ind Manage, 16, pp. 107-121, (2005); Grewala D, Roggeveen AL, Understanding Retail Experiences and Customer Journey Management, J Retailing, 96, pp. 3-8, (2020); Han DL, Tang LC, Huang HC, A Markov model for single-leg air cargo revenue management under a bid-price policy, Eur J Oper Res, 200, pp. 800-811, (2010); He B, Shi Y, Wan Q, Et al., Prediction of customer attrition of commercial banks based on SVM model, Pro Comput Sci, 31, pp. 423-430, (2014); Huang CY, Shen YC, Chiang IP, Et al., Characterizing Web users’ online information behavior, J Am Society Inf Sci Technol, 58, pp. 1988-1997, (2007); Klein R, Sebastian K, Steinhardt C, Et al., A review of revenue management: Recent generalizations and advances in industry applications, Eur J Oper Res, 284, pp. 397-412, (2020); Kraus M, Feuerriegel S, Oztekin A, Deep learning in business analytics and operations research: Models, applications and managerial implications, Eur J Oper Res, 281, pp. 628-641, (2020); Lemon KN, Verhoef PC, Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey, J Mark, 80, (2016); Mainak S, Bruyn AD, LSTM Response Models for Direct Marketing Analytics: Replacing Feature Engineering with Deep Learning, J Interact Mark, 53, pp. 80-95, (2021); Strauss AK, Klein R, Steinhardt C, A review of choice-based revenue management: Theory and methods, Eur J Oper Res, 271, pp. 375-387, (2018); Sun C, Adamopoulos P, Ghose A, Et al., Predicting stages in omnichannel path to purchase: A deep learning model, Inf Syst Res, 33, pp. 429-445, (2022)","T.-C.

In this work, we use a multiarmed bandit approach to dynamically select the combination of house ads to exhibit to a heterogeneous set of customers visiting the website of a large retailer. House ads correspond to promotional information displayed on the website to highlight some specific products and are an important marketing tool for online retailers. As the number of clicks they receive not only depends on their own attractiveness but also on how attractive are other products displayed around them, we decide about complete collections of ads that capture those interactions. More-over, as ads can wear out, in our recommendations we allow for nonstationary rewards. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of customer-level information, we embed a deep neural network to provide personalized recommendations within a bandit scheme. We tested our methods in controlled experiments where we compared them against decisions made by an experienced team of managers and the recommendations of a variety of other bandit policies. Our results show a more active exploration of the decision space and a sig-nificant increment in click-through and add-to-cart rates. © 2022 INFORMS.","deep learning; house ads; multiarmed bandits; personalization","","","","","","Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy, (ICM IS130002, IS130002 ANID)","History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor and Hema Yoganarasimhan served as associate edi-tor for this article.

Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R&D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company’s management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company’s growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm’s commercialization strategy. For the last years, the KIBO Patent Appraisal System (KPAS-II) herein proposed has been advanced by KIBO as a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI) and evaluation data applications valuation system that automatically calculates and estimates a technology’s feasible economic value by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic index information of a patent and the commercialization entity’s business ca-pabilities, and by applying to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method in valuation theory, and finally integrating with deep learning results based on the in-advance previously established patent DB and the financial DB. The KPAS-II proposed in this study can be said to have dramatically overcome the long-term preparation period and high levels of R&D and commercialization costs in terms of the limitations that the existing technology valuation method possesses by enhancing the reliability of approximate economic values from the deep learning results based on financial data and completed valuation data. In addition, it is expected that technology marketing coordinators, researchers, and non-specialty business agents, not limited to valuation experts, can easily estimate the economic values of their patents or technologies, and they can be actively utilized in a technology-based company’s decision-making and technologically dependent financial activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Very little is understood about how users on fantasy sports gaming platforms perceive and approach giving and what essentially matters to users before selecting or engaging with such fantasy sports gaming platforms. This study aims to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards fantasy sports gaming platforms by examining philanthropic actions, well-being (WB) and flow experience (FE). A large-scale research study on 2091 samples was undertaken by adopting three-fold SEM-ANN-NCA (structural equation modeling-artificial neural network-necessary condition analysis) for establishing and empirically testing a comprehensive model by integrating philanthropic actions, WB and FE to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards online fantasy sports gaming platforms. The findings add depth to our understanding of philanthropic actions linked to fantasy sports gaming platforms and users' loyalty and donation intentions towards such platforms. The results of ANN indicated the normalized importance of the predictors of user loyalty and found that philanthropic action was the strongest predictor. Likewise, philanthropic actions, WB, and FE were necessary conditions (must-have) to determine user loyalty during NCA. The findings would provide invaluable intelligence to fantasy gaming companies to oversee critical philanthropic decisions proficiently. In addition, the results would provide valuable insights to decision-makers in philanthropic foundations and other entities, such as practitioners and online fantasy gaming companies, to devise effective marketing strategies to gauge user loyalty and shape donation intentions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","and fantasy sports gaming; flow experience; philanthropic actions; repeat intention to donate; user loyalty; well-being","","","","","","GiET Foundation, (GFRG‐786‐072022)","This work was supported by GiET Foundation (GFRG‐786‐072022).

To model consumer responses to direct marketing, this study proposes Bayesian networks learned by evolutionary programming. Using a large direct marketing data set, we tested the endogeneity bias in the recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) variables using the control function approach; compared the results of Bayesian networks with those of neural networks, classification and regression tree (CART), and latent class regression; and applied a tenfold cross-validation. The results suggest that Bayesian networks have distinct advantages over the other methods in accuracy of prediction, transparency of procedures, interpretability of results, and explanatory insight. Our findings lend strong support to Bayesian networks as a robust tool for modeling consumer response and other marketing problems and for assisting management decision making. © 2006 INFORMS.","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Direct marketing; Evolutionary programming; Machine learning","Behavioral research; Computer programming; Data mining; Database systems; Learning systems; Management; Marketing; Networks (circuits); Tools; Bayesian networks; Direct marketing; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Leone R.P., Jen L., A dynamic model of purchase timing with application to direct marketing, J.

A major shift occurs in the marketing efforts. Given the abundant information on customers and products, marketing responsibility has changed from managing products for sellers to managing relationships with customers, and to facilitating decision-making for customers. These marketing efforts are essentially an intermediary of two-way communication between businesses and customers, and they would require data analysis techniques. Particularly through data mining, which comprises techniques for the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, organisations are able to identify valuable customers, predict future behaviours, and allow firms to make proactive, knowledge driven decisions. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each method having its advantages and disadvantages for different types of marketing purposes. This paper examines the issue of applying different techniques to meet the marketing requirements in the network economy. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). Two case studies are provided to illustrate how different data mining techniques can be utilised to accomplish various marketing efforts.

Due to the dynamic complexities of both internal and external corporate environments, many firms resort to qualitative forecasting techniques. However, these qualitative techniques lack the structure and extrapolation capability of quantitative forecasting models, and forecasting inaccuracies typically lead to dramatic disturbances in production planning. This paper presents the development of a hybrid econometric-neural network model for forecasting total monthly sales. This model attempts to integrate the structural characteristics of econometric models with the non-linear pattern recognition features of neural networks to create a ""hybrid"" modeling approach. A three-stage model is created that attempts to sequentially ""filter"" forecasts where the output from one stage becomes part of the input to the next stage. The forecasts from each of the individual sub-models are then ""averaged"" to compute the hybrid forecast. Model development is discussed in the content of an actual sales forecasting problem from a Danish company that produces consumer goods. Actual model performance is reported for a six-month time period. Knowledge gained from the modeling approach is placed in the context of organizational learning about the nature of sales forecasting for this particular company.","Hybrid econometric-neural network; Sales forecasting","Decision making; Forecasting; Manufacture; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Hybrid econometric neural network; Sales forecasting; Marketing","","","","","","","Goodrich R.L., Business Forecast Systems, Applied Statistical Forecasting, (1989); Elsayed E.A., Boucher T.O., Analysis and Control of Production Systems, 2nd Ed., (1994); Pindyck R.S., Rubinfeld D.L., Econometric Models and Economic Forecasts, 3rd Ed., (1991); Simon H.A., The New Science of Management Decisions, (1960); Newell A., Simon H.A., Human Problem Solving, (1972); Mintzberg H., Rasinghani D., Theoret A., The structure of the unstructured decision processes, Admin.

Brands are looking for improved ways to identify valuable influencers among a vast catalogue; this is even more challenging with micro-influencers, which are more affordable than mainstream ones but difficult to discover. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework to improve the state of the art in micro-influencer ranking based on multimedia content. Moreover, since the visual congruence between a brand and influencer has been shown to be a good measure of compatibility, we provide an effective visual method for interpreting our model's decisions, which can also be used to inform brands' media strategies. We compare with the current state of the art on a recently constructed public dataset and we show significant improvement both in terms of accuracy and model complexity. We also introduce a methodology for tuning the image and text contribution to the final ranking score. The techniques for ranking and interpretation presented in this work can be generalized to arbitrary multimedia ranking tasks that have datasets with a similar structure.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Influencer marketing; interpretability; multi-task learning; multimodal; neural networks","Commerce; Marketing; Branded products; Influence marketing; Interpretability; Multi tasks; Multi-modal; Multimedia contents; Multimedia frameworks; Neural-networks; Social media; State of the art; Learning systems","","","","","","","Zietek N., Influencer marketing: The characteristics and components of fashion influencer marketing, (2016); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.

Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer information; Customer lifetime value;

By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts. Experiments are carried out with a dataset from one of the top streaming service companies, and results display overall better performance compared to various standalone methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Embeddings; Gradient boosting decision tree; Popularity prediction; Streaming service","Cost reduction; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; E-learning; Forecasting; IPTV; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Video recording; Video streaming; Categorical variables; Historical data; Historical view; Hybrid machine learning; Online video streaming; Popularity predictions; Streaming service; Video contents; artificial neural network; comparative study; data set; Internet; machine learning; marketing; performance assessment; prediction; Learning systems","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2017-0-00705); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government( MSIP ) (No. 2017-0-00705 , Development of Media Streaming system with Machine Learning using QoE(Quality of Experience)) ","Bartlett P.L., Hazan E., Rakhlin A., Adaptive online gradient descent, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 65-72, (2007); Chen F., Zhang C., Wang F., Liu J., Wang X., Liu Y., Cloud-assisted live streaming for crowdsourced multimedia content, IEEE Trans Multimedia, 17, 9, pp. 1471-1483, (2015); Chen J., Chen C., Using particle swarm optimization algorithm in multimedia cdn content placement, 2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, pp. 45-51, (2012); Chen L., Zhou Y., Chiu D.M., Smart streaming for online video services, IEEE Trans.

The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets. The sensitivity analysis is performed using pricing concept. The applicability of the model is illustrated in a numerical example. © 2021 Iranian journal of Management Studies.","Decision Support Systems (DSS); Dynamic Programming (DP); Information Technology (IT); Perceptron Neural Network","","","","","","","","Aragon-Correa J.

Prior research indicates that human values could be tapped to understand the consumers' responses to perceived organizational motives behind undertaking social cause initiatives. This research employs Schwartz's theory of human values to examine consumers' patronage intentions towards CRM-linked fashion products. Moreover, fashion leaders play a crucial role in the diffusion of the latest fashion and fashion trends. This research investigates by integrating human values and fashion leadership, offering insights into CRM-linked fashion consumption motives. Design/methodology/approach: The overarching goal was to investigate the complex interplay between human values and female fashion leadership to predict CRM patronage intention (CPI). Hence, a large-scale research study on 2,050 samples was undertaken by adopting threefold partial least squares–multigroup analysis–artificial neural network (PLS-MGA-ANN) to establish and empirically test a comprehensive model. Findings: This study is unique as it establishes and validates the relative or normalized importance placed on human values by fashion leaders, thereby predicting CPIs. The results revealed that women with high-fashion leadership and specific value types (benevolence, universalism, self-direction) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion retailers. In addition, the findings validated that women with low-fashion leadership and specific value types (tradition, security, conformity) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion stores. Originality/value: The findings provide a valuable rationale to non-profit marketers, fashion marketing experts and practitioners to design customer value-based profiling and manage crucial CRM decisions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cause-related marketing; CRM patronage intention; Female fashion leadership; Human values; Non-profit marketing","","","","","","GiET foundation, (GFRG-786-082022)","This work was supported by GiET foundation [Grant Number GFRG-786-082022].

Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

Design/methodology/approach: Gap-spotting methods were used to develop the research questions, followed by model development using the social exchange and social-network theories. Data were collected from 429 samples. The study applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses followed by ANN application. Findings: The study identified five factors related to gamification that have a significant adverse effect on the mental and emotional well-being of the users. Furthermore, the results of PLS-SEM were then compared through an artificial neural network (ANN) analytic process, revealing consistency for the model. This research presents a theoretical contribution by providing critical insights into online gamers' mental and emotional health. It implies that gamification can even bring mental and emotional disturbance. The resulting situation might lead to undesirable social consequences. Practical implications: The result highlights the managerial and social relevance from the perspective of a developing country. As respondents are becoming more engrossed in online gaming, managers and decision-makers need to take preventive measures to overcome the dark side of online gaming. Originality/value: The present study shows that the dark side of gamification has some adverse effects on human mental and emotional health. The study's findings can be used to improve gamification strategies while engaging online communities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adverse effects; Artificial neural network; Cyberbullying;

Traders can use the software as an effective decision-making tool by modeling and simulating a power market. The software uses different features of a decision support system by creating a framework for assessing new trading strategies in a competitive electricity trading environment. The practicality of the software is confirmed by comparing its estimation accuracy with those of other methods (e.g., neural network and genetic algorithm). The software has been applied to a data set regarding the California electricity crisis in order to examine whether the learning (convergence) speed of traders is different between the two periods (before and during the crisis). Such an application confirms the validity of the proposed software. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Case overview/synopsis: Cafe Galavis was one of the leading family businesses in industrial development and had the highest business recognition, with a century of experience in producing and commercializing roasted and ground coffee in Cucuta, Colombia. In 2015, the diplomatic crisis between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela led to the indefinite closure of the Colombian–Venezuelan border, which caused an increase in income from smuggled coffee. In addition, the presence of different competitors and traditional brands negatively impacted the level of sales, which considerably affected financial stability. Likewise, internal difficulties of family nature and administrative management led to the change of senior management. By 2016, Juan Yáñez was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) and was in charge of avoiding the company’s closure. In January 2023, he received feedback from his consulting team, and upon evaluation of the new market challenges with his collaborators, he realized a great challenge that merited the search for a priority alternative solution. How to design a new product considering the loss of brand identity in the face of the generational change of its consumers? These were some of the challenges posed by the CEO that consequently required starting a strategic management process of innovation. Complexity academic level: The teaching case is aimed at students of postgraduate academic programs in the areas of knowledge of innovation, product design, industrial design, marketing or MBA. In the modules of marketing, strategic management, brand management and strategic foresight, the case allowed for the orientation of the concepts of brand value or branding as well as the analysis of the value chain for the implementation of strategies that promote competitive advantages of companies. Similarly, in the modules of product or service design, creativity and innovation and complex thinking, the case allows one to approach a complex problem and apply creativity techniques for its solution.

The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted. Finally, this work shows and compares the classification results obtained with the combination of sampling techniques and Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and Artificial Neural Networks. The testing approach follows a walk-forward validation procedure, which simulates a production environment and reveals the ability to accurately classify each future campaign. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","direct marketing;

Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is able to increase the classification accuracy of several existing works based on RNN models for sentiment analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; BiLSTM; FastText; GRU; LSTM; Natural language processing;

The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of new factors which have relation to a client’s creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client’s creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The knowledge gained from the evaluation model is immediately possible to use in the strategic management of insurance companies e.g. in marketing activities. © 2017, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

To achieve flexibility deterministic utility is approximated by a neural net of the multilayer perceptron type. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method serves to estimate heterogeneous multinomial probit models which fulfill economic restrictions on signs of (marginal) effects of predictors (e.g., negative for price). For empirical choice data the heterogeneous multinomial probit model extended by a multilayer perceptron clearly outperforms all the other models studied. Moreover, replacing homogeneous by heterogeneous reference price mechanisms and thus allowing price expectations to be formed differently across households also leads to better model performance. Mean utility differences and mean elasticities w.r.t. price and price deviation from reference price demonstrate that models with linear utility and nonlinear utility approximated by a multilayer perceptron lead to very different implications for managerial decision making.

Three kinds of variables, expert knowledge, marketing information and environmental data, are examined. The information about the effects of each of these variables has been studied and made available for decision making. However, their combined effect is unknown. This study attempts to explore the combined effect for the benefit of our collaborator, a multinational corporation (MNC) in the consumer electronics industry in Singapore. Putting these three variables together as input variables results in a neural network model. Neural network training is conducted using historical data on CTV sales in Singapore collected over the past one and a half years. Sensitivity analysis is then performed to reduce input variables of neural networks. This is done by analyzing the weights of the input node connections in the trained neural networks using two different methods. The weaker variables can be excluded, and this results in a simpler model. Further, an R-Square value of almost 1 is obtained through the inclusion of an Unknown variable when the network model consisting only of the most influential variables is trained and tested. Knowing the most influential variables, which in this case include Average Price, Screen Size, Stereo Systems, Flat-Square screen type and Seasonal Factors, marketing managers can improve sales performance by paying more attention to them.","Artificial neural networks; Marketing decision support systems; Marketing mix; Sales forecasting; Variable reduction","Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Marketing; Sensitivity analysis; Supervisory personnel; Sales forecasting; Variable reduction; Neural networks","","","","","","","Little D.C.J., Decision support systems for marketing managers, Journal of Marketing, 43, 3, pp. 9-26, (1979); Wong B.K., Bodnovich T.A., Selvi Y., A bibliography of neural network business applications research: 1988 - September 1994, Expert Systems: The International Journal of Knowledge Engineering, 12, 3, pp. 253-262, (1995); White H., Connetionist nonparametric regression: Multilayer feedforward neural networks can learn arbitrary mappings, Neural Networks, 3, pp. 535-549, (1990); Rumelhart D.E., Hinton G.E., Williams R.J., Learning internal representation by error propagation, Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Micro-structure of Cognition, 1, pp. 318-362, (1986); Maren A., Harston C., Pap R., Handbook of Neural Network Computing Applications, (1990); Proctor R.A., Marketing decision support systems: A role for neural networking, Market Intelligence & Planning, 10, 1, pp. 21-26, (1992); Dutta S., Shekhar S., Wong W.Y., Decision support in non-conservative domains: Generalisation with neural networks, Decision Support Systems, 11, 5, pp. 527-544, (1994); Venugopal V., Baets W., Neural networks and their applications in marketing management, Journal of Systems Management, 45, 9, pp. 16-21, (1994); Schocken S., Ariav G., Neural networks for decision support: Problems and opportunities, Decision Support Systems, 11, 5, pp. 393-414, (1994); Hill T., Ramus W., Neural network models for intelligent support of managerial decision making, Decision Support Systems, 11, 5, pp. 449-459, (1994); Yao J.T., Li Y.L., Tan C.L., Forecasting the exchange rates of CHF vs. USD using neural networks, Journal of Computational Intelligence in Finance, 5, 2, pp. 7-13, (1997); Kotler P., Marketing Management, Analysis, Planning, Implementation and Control, (1994); Levin R.I., Rubin D.S., Statistics for Management, (1991); Azoff E.M., Neural Network Time Series Forecasting of Financial Markets, (1994); Gately E., Neural Networkds for Financial Forecasting, (1996); Poh H.L., Yao J.T., Jasic T., Neural networks for the analysis and forecasting of advertising and promotion impact, International Journal of Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 7, 4, (1998); Teng N.Y.W., Analysis and implementation of a marketing decision support system, Honours Year Project Report, (1996)","J.

The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy. After applying the decomposition part, the results have RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values of 49.59%, 22.58%, and 21.99% lower than those of the individual prediction part, respectively. This research presents a novel approach for market participants in the soybean industry for risk response. It gives a new perspective on agricultural product prices in sustainable agricultural marketing, while also providing practical tools for developing public policies and decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","CEEMDAN; CNN-GRU-Attention; fuzzy entropy; soybean spot price","China; cluster analysis; entropy; fuzzy mathematics; soybean; sustainability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71573042, 71973028)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 71573042 and 71973028.","Yao H., Zuo X., Zuo D., Lin H., Huang X., Zang C., Study on soybean potential productivity and food security in China under the influence of COVID-19 outbreak, Geogr.

The study aims to quantify and determine the impacts of marketing decisions on delivery performance and on flexibility of the operations area. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal case study was conducted and the variables used in the model were derived from established theories and were evaluated with artificial neural networks. The case of a food manufacturing company was selected to reflect the relations in the marketing/operations interface of a low technological intensity enterprise. Findings: The results show that the decisions on Place/Channel, Price and Product dimensions of marketing exert a significant impact on flexibility and delivery performance of the operation area. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the case study cannot be generalised and the outcomes are specific to just one firm. However, the approach lends itself to replication, particularly within low technological intensity companies. Originality/value: Prior studies have focussed on coordination among functional areas as marketing and operations at higher levels of abstraction. The study contemplate empirical propositions through the data analysis of a company with a low technological intensity that can be used to improve managers' decisions and alignment in the Marketing/Operation Interface. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial neural networks; Delivery; Flexibility; Marketing; Operations","","","","","","","","Araujo C.A.S., Wanke P., Siqueira M.M., A performance analysis of Brazilian public health: TOPSIS and neural networks application, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 67, 9, pp. 1526-1549, (2018); Azoury K.S., Miyaoka J., Managing production and distribution for supply chains in the processed food industry, Productions and Operations Management, 22, 5, pp. 1250-1268, (2013); Barbosa L.M., Lacerda D.P., Piran F.A.S., Dresch A., Exploratory analysis of the variables prevailing on the effects os product modularization on production volume and efficiency, International Journal of Production Economics, 193, pp. 677-690, (2017); Bejou D., Wray B., Ingram T.N., Determinants of relationship quality: an artificial neural network analysis, Journal of Business Research, 36, 2, pp. 137-143, (1996); Berry W.L., Bozarth C.C., Hill T.J., Klompmaker J.E., Factory focus: segmenting markets from an operations perspective, Journal of Operations Management, 10, 3, pp. 363-387, (1991); Berry W.L., Hill T., Klompmaker J.E., Aligning marketing and manufacturing strategies with the market, International Journal of Production Research, 37, 16, pp. 3599-3618, (1999); Bouranta N., Psomas E., A comparative analysis of competitive priorities and business performance between manufacturing and service firms, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 66, 7, pp. 914-931, (2017); Chi T., Kilduff P., Gargeya V., Alignment between business environment characteristics, competitive priorities, supply chain structures and firm business performance, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 58, 7, pp. 645-669, (2009); A Indústria em Números.

With the large array of service offerings, telecom providers engage in active advertising of service bundles to attract new as well as retain the existing customers. Focused advertising by personalising the service bundles based on individual customer preferences is a key success factor of such campaigns. This paper proposes the application of a neural network-based decision support model for pattern association using which mixed bundles of such services may be identified, as per customer preferences, so as to induce higher conversion in cross-sales and up-sales. Consumer service preferences can be combined with some standard packages of VAS bundles to personalise the service bundles and these service bundles would be generated dynamically. Identifying and promoting such services identified through pattern association rules will have a direct impact on the overall profitability of the service provider.

These decisions, however, are influenced by various antecedent factors. This implies that shoppers look beyond the basic chore of shopping and experience while shopping plays a vital role. To attract the attention of shoppers, mall developers make huge investments in mall promotion and ambient factors in order to enhance the shopping experience. As the Indian shoppers’ euphoria about shopping malls gets toned down with time, mall managers need to focus on something more substantive. Such fundamental benefits can be offered to shoppers only if mall managers know what is more relevant for the shoppers visiting the malls. Past studies have identified a number of factors such as ambience, physical infrastructure, convenience, safety, and marketing activities. This research posits that a more optimal and focused approach in mall management requires identification of relative significance of various influencing factors. This way, mall managers would be able to offer the most meaningful benefits to shoppers at a very optimal level of investment. Once shoppers get what they value the most, they are expected to be more loyal to the shopping mall. Despite the development of various forecasting techniques, predicting mall loyalty has remained under-explored in marketing literature. This article addresses the gap by using neural network model to predict shoppers’ loyalty towards a particular mall. To gain more insights from the model, the authors have also identified relative significance of the factors impacting shoppers’ mall selection. This study establishes that mall shoppers value ‘convenience’ as the most influencing factor in their selection of malls. This factor alone garners one-third of the total weightage among the five factors, which reflects that significance of convenience is 66 per cent more than what is expected in a scenario when all determinants contribute equally. This strongly indicates that Indian mall shoppers are more utilitarian than hedonic. © 2017, © 2017 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.","Malls selection; Neural network; Predictive analysis; Retailing;

Dynamic pricing has been studied from the airline’s point of view, with a focus on demand forecasting and price differentiation. Early demand forecasting on a specific route can assist an airline in strategically planning flights and determining optimal pricing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A feedforward neural network was employed in the current study. Two hidden layers, consisting of 18 and 12 neurons, were incorporated to enhance the network’s capabilities. The activation function employed for these layers was tanh. Additionally, it was considered that the output layer’s functions were linear. The neural network inputs considered in this study were flight path, month of flight, flight date (week/day), flight time, aircraft type (Boeing, Airbus, other), and flight class (economy, business). The neural network output, on the other hand, was the ticket price. The dataset comprises 16,585 records, specifically flight data for Iranian airlines for 2022. Findings: The findings indicate that the model achieved a high level of accuracy in approximating the actual data. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to predict the optimal ticket price for various flight routes with minimal error. Practical implications: Based on the significant alignment observed between the actual data and the tested data utilizing the algorithmic model, airlines can proactively anticipate ticket prices across all routes, optimizing the revenue generated by each flight. The neural network algorithm utilized in this study offers a valuable opportunity for companies to enhance their decision-making processes. By leveraging the algorithm’s features, companies can analyze past data effectively and predict future prices. This enables them to make informed and timely decisions based on reliable information. Originality/value: The present study represents a pioneering research endeavor that investigates using a neural network algorithm to predict the most suitable pricing for various flight routes. This study aims to provide valuable insights into dynamic pricing for marketing researchers and practitioners. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airlines; Dynamic pricing; Neural network; Price prediction;

The visible light communication channel model is constructed, and a fusion length limited coding mode is set to make the signal transmitted by visible light communication more in line with the overall response of the channel. The decision feedback equalizer is selected as the equalizer, and the channel cascade impulse response condition is set to compensate the distorted output of the channel. The blind equalization algorithm is designed to classify the data by unsupervised learning, and the extreme point of the error function is found through iterative calculation to optimize the equalizer. The simulation results show that under the same SNR test conditions, the bit error rate of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the blind equalization algorithm based on LMS and BP neural network. Under the condition of SNR = 20dB, the bit error rate is significantly reduced to the order of 10-5, with high communication quality. The VLC system uses an LED backlight display with a CMOS camera. In general, this panel is used to display marketing information. By adjusting the brightness of the CMOS camera's rolling shutter effect (RSE), additional data, such as dynamic content, may be wirelessly sent. NR (noise to signal) ratio of VLC can't keep up with the variety of material being shown on the screen. It is possible to significantly enhance the CMOS RSE pattern decomposition by using a grayscale value distribution (GVD) and a machine learning method (MLA). © 2021 ThinkBiotech LLC.

They are characterized through their metamorphosis as the vertical brands sell their products from the manufacturer to consumers directly without any interruptions from distribution channels as in traditional mode of doing business. They are annihilating themselves in the virtual platforms and later disrupting their existing linear sales models. This empirical investigation is targeted to construct an algorithmic model through a deep learning process which has been instrumental to predict the purchase decision. This investigation has churned a predictive model that is based on the attributes of the buying behaviour of the consumers. The attributes of online buying behaviour like safety of transaction, availability of innovative products and quality of products have been considered to build a predictive model through artificial neural network (ANN). The accuracy of training and testing data are closer, which infers about the consistency and validity of the predictive model. There are several consequences arising from the predictive model obtained that can be seeded from customer-centred marketing and further stemmed from the framing of business strategy, gaining insights into market architecture and choice of customer © 2022 Fortune Institute of International Business.","artificial neural network (ANN); deep learning; demand forecasting; Direct to consumer brands; purchase intention","","","","","","","","Akter S., Wamba S.F., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, International Journal of Production Economics, 182, pp. 113-131, (2016); Alfandari L., Hassanzadeh A., Ljubic I., An exact method for assortment optimization under the nested logit model, European Journal of Operational Research, 291, 3, pp. 830-845, (2021); Alptekinoglu A., Grasas A., When to carry eccentric products?

The research examined the antecedents to the adoption of mobile tourism shopping (MTS) via an integrated model, consisting of the Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, consumer perception of merchant ethics, consumer decision-making styles, and characteristics of mobile applications. The results were empirically validated via the PLS-SEM-ANN method. The findings indicated that mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use, application quality, and service quality have significant positive correlations with the intention to use MTS, whereas privacy concern has displayed a significant negative relationship. Moreover, source reliability, application reputation, perfectionism, and novelty-fashion consciousness were revealed to be statistically insignificant to the development of adoption intention toward MTS. Furthermore, the ANN results have indicated the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute in the prediction of ANN Model A. The research has generated valuable theoretical implications and practical insights. For one, the advantages that come with the adoption of MTS and the security measures taken by the service providers should be highlighted to the prospects via effective marketing messages to nurture confidence, which can subsequently drive adoption. © 2021 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","artificial neural network analysis; consumer decision-making; Mobile commerce; privacy concern; tourism","Decision making; Mobile computing; Neural networks; Artificial neural network analysis; Consumer decision making; Consumer decision-making styles; Consumer perception; Integrated modeling; Mobile applications; Mobile Technology; Privacy concerns; Technology acceptance model; Tourism industry; Mobile commerce","","","","","","","Tan G.W.H., Lee V.H., Hew J.J., Ooi K.B., Wong L.W., “The interactive mobile social media advertising: An imminent approach to advertise tourism products and services?”, Telematics and Informatics, Elsevier, 35, 8, pp. 2270-2288, (2018); Sarkar S., Khare A., Sadachar A., Influence of consumer decision-making styles on use of mobile shopping applications, Benchmark An Int J, 27, 1, pp. 1-20, (2019); Hew J.J., Leong L.Y., Tan G.W.H., Ooi K.B., Lee V.H., The age of mobile social commerce: an artificial neural network analysis on its resistances, Technol Forecast Soc Change, 144, pp. 311-324, (2019); Hew J.J., Leong L.Y., Tan G.W.H., Lee V.H., Ooi K.B., Mobile social tourism shopping: a dual-stage analysis of a multi-mediation model, Tour Manag, Elsevier Ltd, 66, pp. 121-139, (2018); Hew J.J., Tan G.W.H., Lin B., Ooi K.B., Generating travel-related contents through mobile social tourism: does privacy paradox persist?, Telemat Inform, Elsevier Ltd, 34, 7, pp. 914-935, (2017); Dorcic J., Komsic J., Markovic S., Mobile technologies and applications towards smart tourism–state of the art, Tour Rev, 74, 1, pp. 82-103, (2019); Douglas A., Mobile business travel application usage Are South African men really from Mars and women from Venus?, J Hosp Tour Technol, 10, 3, pp. 269-285, (2019); Mahrous A.A., Hassan S.S., Achieving superior customer experience: an investigation of multichannel choices in the travel and tourism industry of an emerging market, J Travel Res, SAGE Publications Ltd, 56, 8, pp. 1049-1064, (2017); Ooi K.B., Tan G.W.H., Mobile technology acceptance model: an investigation using mobile users to explore smartphone credit card, Expert Syst Appl, 59, pp. 33-46, (2016); Tan G.W.H., Ooi K.B., Gender and age: do they really moderate mobile tourism shopping behavior?, Telemat Inform, Elsevier, 35, 6, pp. 1617-1642, (2018); Anwar A., Thongpapanl N., Ashraf A.R., Strategic imperatives of mobile commerce in developing countries: the influence of consumer innovativeness, ubiquity, perceived value, risk, and cost on usage, J Strateg Mark, 29, 8, pp. 722-742, (2021); Elbeltagi I., Agag G., E-retailing ethics and its impact on customer satisfaction and repurchase intention: a cultural and commitment-trust theory perspective, Internet Res, 26, 1, pp. 288-310, (2016); Mokhlis S., An investigation of consumer decision-making styles of young-adults in Malaysia, Int J Bus Manag, 4, 4, (2009); Tan G.W.H., Lee V.H., Hew J.J., Ooi K.B., Wong L.W., The interactive mobile social media advertising: an imminent approach to advertise tourism products and services?, Telemat Inform, Elsevier, 35, 8, pp. 2270-2288, (2018); Celik H., Customer online shopping anxiety within the unified theory of acceptance and use technology (UTAUT) framework, Asia Pacific J Mark Logist, 28, (2016); Shukla A., Sharma S.K., Evaluating consumers’ adoption of mobile technology for grocery shopping: an application of technology acceptance model, Vision, 22, 2, pp. 185-198, (2018); Tew H.-T., Tan G.W.-H., Loh X.-M., Lee V.-H., Lim W.-L., Ooi K.-B., Tapping the next purchase: embracing the wave of mobile payment, J Comput Inf Syst, pp. 1-9, (2021); Mohd Suki N., Determinants of consumers’ purchase intentions of organic vegetables: some insights from Malaysia, J Food Prod Mark, Routledge, 24, 4, pp. 392-412, (2018); Solomon M.R., Zaichkowsky J.L., Polegato R., Consumer behavior: buying, having, and being, (2008); Hasan B., Perceived irritation in online shopping: the impact of website design characteristics, Comp Human Behav, Elsevier Ltd, 54, pp. 224-230, (2016); McDowell W.C., Wilson R.C., Kile C.O., An examination of retail website design and conversion rate, J Bus Res, 69, 11, pp. 4837-4842, (2016); Tsao W.C., Hsieh M.T., Lin T.M.Y., Intensifying online loyalty!

Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Phenomenon such as out of stock and slow sales has been common in recent years. These issues can be managed only when the occurrence of the sales volume is predicted in advance, and sufficient warnings can be executed in time. Thus, keeping in mind the importance of the sales prediction system, the purpose of this paper is to propose an effective sales prediction model and make digital marketing strategies with the machine learning model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the consumer purchasing behavior decision theory, we discuss the factors affecting product sales, including external factors, consumer perception, consumer potential purchase behavior and consumer traffic. Then we propose a sales prediction model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, using the time-series prediction that ensures the effective prediction of sales about each product in a short time on online stores based on the sales data in the previous term or month or year. The proposed M-GNA-XGBOOST model serves as an adaptive prediction model, for which the instant factors and the sales data of the previous period are the input, and the optimal computation is based on the proposed methodology. The adaptive prediction using the proposed model is developed based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The model inherits the advantages among the algorithms with better accuracy and forecasts the sales of each product in the store with instant data characteristics for the first time. Findings: The analysis using Jingdong dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is enhanced and the accuracy that instant data as input is found to be better compared with the model that lagged data as input. The root means squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed model are found to be around 11.9 and 8.23. According to the sales prediction of each product, the resource can be arranged in advance, and the marketing strategy of product positioning, product display optimization, inventory management and product promotion is designed for online stores. Originality/value: The paper proposes and implements a new model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, to predict sales of each product for online stores. Our work provides reference and enlightenment for the establishment of accurate sales-based digital marketing strategies for online stores. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Deep learning; Integration model;

Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city. Similar results were achieved through out our research when using the mentioned algorithms. However, the best results were achieved when using the C5.0 algorithm. Finally, we summarized the presented problems, and compared its accuracy in classification on the basis of decision trees, with classification results based on the probabilistic neural network and the radial basis function neural network.","Classification; Decision trees; Quality; Regional management","","","","","","","","Abrahams A.S., Seeing the woods for the decision trees; Adamcik S., Regionální Politika a Management Regionů Obcí a Měst, (2000); Berka P., Dobývání Znalostí z Databází, (2003); Broomhead D., Lowe D., Multivariable functional interpolation and adaptive networks, Complex Systems, 2, pp. 321-355, (1988); Buhman M.D., Radial basis functions: Theory and implementations, Cambridge Monographs on Applied and Computational Mathematics, (2003); Clark N.M., Population health and the environmen, Essays on the Future of Environmental Health Research; Demuth H., Beale M., Hagan M., Neural network toolbox for use with MATLAB, The MathWorks, (2005); Methodical guidelines for a core and extended set of indicators, European Environment and Health Information System; Espinosa J., Vandewalle J., Wertz J., Fuzzy Logic Identification and Predictive Control, (2004); Guidici P., Applied Data Mining: Statistical Methods for Business and Industry, (2003); Guo J., Lin Y., Sun Z., A novel metod for protein subcellular localization based on boosting and probabilistic neural network, Proc. of the 2nd Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference, 29, (2004); Hlavackova K., Neruda R., Radial basis function network, Neural Network World, 3, 1, pp. 93-101, (1993); Han J., Kamber M., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, (2001); Jalovecka M., 5. konference kvality ve veřejné správě - Paříž 2008, Veřejná Správa: Týdeník Vlády České Republiky, 11, 5, (2008); Kasparova M., Krupka J., Pirko J., Modelování spokojenosti občanů ve vztahu k regionálnímu rozvoji a kvalitě života, Scientific Papers - Series D, 13, pp. 109-120, (2008); Maimon O., Rokach L., Decomposition Metodology for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, (2005); Mandys J., Analýza Poskytovatelů Sociálních Služeb ve Městě Pardubice, (2007); Montana D.J., A weighted probabilistic neural network, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 4, pp. 1110-1117, (1992); Neruda R., Kudova P., Learning methods for radial basis function network, Future Generation Computer Systems, 21, 7, pp. 1131-1142, (2005); Novak J., Evropské Indikátory Udržitelného Rozvoje v Praxi Měst České Republiky; Orr M., Et al., Assessing RBF networks using DELVE, International Journal of Neural Systems, 10, pp. 397-415, (2000); Pospichal J., Neurónové siete a umelá inteligencia, Úvod do Teórie Neurónových Sieté, pp. 43-56, (1997); Pucek M., Et al., Měření Spokojenosti v Organizacích Veřejné Správ - Soubor Příkladů, (2005); Pyle D., Business Modeling and Data Mining, (2003); Rokach L., Maimon O., Data Mining with Decision Trees, (2008); Shafrity J.M., Russell E.W., Borick Ch.P., Introducing Public Administration, (2008); Shinners S.M., Modern Control System Theory and Design, (1998); The Philosophy of Mathematics Today, (2003); Tkac J., Chovanec A., The application of neural networks for detection and identification of fault conditions, Metalurgija, 49, 2, pp. 566-569, (2010); Trefil J.S., The Nature of Science: An A-Z Guide to the Laws and Principles Governing Our, (2003); Turban E., Aronson J.E., Liang T.P., Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, (2005); Vassilakis H., Howell A.J., Buton H., Comparison of feedforward (TDRBF) and generative (TDRGBN) network for gesture based control, Gesture and Sign Language in Human-computer Interactions.

This relationship has been the focus of attention of other scholars, but much remains to be done in terms of providing a better understanding of it. To help fill this gap, we analyze the impact of marketing decisions on delivery performance. More specifically, we seek to know how sales, sellers, promotion and other variables that characterize marketing decisions impact delivery performance. We collected data about marketing decisions and delivery performance for a period of 30 months in a large manufacturing company in Brazil. We performed an artificial neural network analysis to assess how these marketing decision variables impact delivery performance variables in the company analyzed. Results show that seller characteristics are the variables that have the greatest impact on the performance of delivery operations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.

Technologies such as data warehousing, data mining, and campaign management software have made customer relationship management a new area where firms can gain a competitive advantage. Particularly through data mining-the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases-organizations can identify valuable customers, predict future behaviors, and enable firms to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. The automated, future-oriented analyses made possible by data mining move beyond the analyses of past events typically provided by history-oriented tools such as decision support systems. Data mining tools answer business questions that in the past were too time-consuming to pursue. Yet, it is the answers to these questions make customer relationship management possible. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each with their own advantages and challenges for different types of applications. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). While differing approaches abound in the realm of data mining, the use of some type of data mining is necessary to accomplish the goals of today's customer relationship management philosophy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, United States","The potential of neural networks for classification problems has been established by numerous successful applications reported in the literature. One of the major assumptions used in almost all studies is the equal cost consequence of misclassification. With this assumption, minimizing the total number of misclassification errors is the sole objective in developing a neural network classifier. Often this is done simply to ease model development and the selection of classification decision points. However, it is not appropriate for many real situations such as quality assurance, direct marketing, bankruptcy prediction, and medical diagnosis where misclassification costs have unequal consequences for different categories. In this paper, we investigate the issue of unequal misclassification costs in neural network classifiers. Through an application in thyroid disease diagnosis, we find that different cost considerations have significant effects on the classification performance and that appropriate use of cost information can aid in optimal decision making. A cross-validation technique is employed to alleviate the problem of bias in the training set and to examine the robustness of neural network classifiers with regard to sampling variations and cost differences.","Classification; Medical diagnosis; Misclassification Costs; Neural Networks; Statistical Techniques","","","","","","","","Bahemuka M., Hodkinson H.M., Screening for hypothyroidism in elderly inpatients, British Medical Journal, 2, pp. 601-603, (1975); Cybenko G., Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function, Mathematical Control Signals Systems, 2, pp. 303-314, (1989); Danese M.D., Screening for mild thyroid failure at the periodic health examination, Journal of American Medical Association, 276, 4, pp. 285-292, (1996); Dos Remedios L.V., Weber P.M., Feldman R., Schurr D.A., Tsoi T.G., Detecting unsuspected thyroid dysfunction by the free thyroxine index, Archives of Internal Medicine, 140, pp. 1045-1049, (1980); Duda R.O., Hart P., Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, (1973); Fukazawa H., Sakurada T., Yoshida K., Free thyroxine estimation for the screening of hyper-and hypothyroidism in an adult population, TOHOKU Journal of Experimental Medicine, 148, pp. 411-420, (1986); Gavin L.A., The diagnostic dilemmas of hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia, Advances in Internal Medicine, 33, pp. 185-204, (1988); Gordon A.D., Classification, (1981); Hornik K., Approximation capabilities of multilayer feedforward networks, Neural Networks, 4, pp. 251-257, (1991); Hornik K., Stinchcombe M., White H., Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, 2, pp. 359-366, (1989); Hung M.S., Hu M.Y., Patuwo B.E., Shanker M., Estimating posterior probabilities in classification problems with neural networks, International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Organizations, 1, pp. 49-60, (1996); Kohers G., Rakes T.R., Rees L.P., The use of neural networks and combined forecasts in the prediction of portfolio returns with different penalty costs, Proceedings of the 1994 Annual Meeting of the Decision Sciences Institute, pp. 1331-1333, (1994); Kohers G., Rakes T.R., Rees L.P., Predicting weekly portfolio returns with the use of composite models: A comparison of neural networks and traditional composite models, Proceedings of the 1996 Annual Meeting of the Decision Sciences Institute, pp. 1132-1134, (1996); Nolan J.P., Tarsa N.J., Dibenedetto G., Case-finding for unsuspected thyroid disease: Costs and health benefits, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 83, pp. 346-355, (1985); Papoulix A., Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes, (1965); Patuwo B.E., Hu M.Y., Hung M.S., Two-group classification using neural networks, Decision Sciences, 24, 4, pp. 825-845, (1993); Philipoom P.R., Wiegmann L., Rees L.P., Cost-based due-date assignment with the use of classical and neural network approaches, Naval Research Logistics, 44, 1, pp. 21-46, (1997); Postellon D.C., Abdallah A., Congenital hypothyroidism: Diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, Comprehensive Therapy, 12, pp. 67-71, (1986); Press S.J., Wilson S., Choosing between logistic regression and discriminant analysis, American Statistical Association, 73, pp. 699-705, (1978); Quinlan J., Simplifying decision trees, International Journal of Man-machine Studies, 27, pp. 221-234, (1987); Richard M.D., Lippmann R.P., Neural network classifiers estimate basyesian a posterior probabilities, Neural Computation, 3, pp. 461-483, (1991); Riedmiller M., Braun H., A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning: The Rprop algorithm, Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Networks, (1993); Rumelhart D.E., Hinton G.E., Williams R.J., Learning internal representations by error propagation, Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition, (1986); Salchengerger L.M., Cinar E.M., Lash N.A., Neural networks: A new tool for predicting thrift failures, Decision Sciences, 23, 4, pp. 899-916, (1992); Tunbridge W.M., Brewis M., French J.M., The spectrum of thyroid disease in a community: The Wickham survey, Clinical Endocrinology, 7, pp. 481-493, (1977); Weiss S.M., Kulilowski C.A., Computer Systems That Learn, (1991); White G.H., Walmsley R.N., Can the initial assessment of thyroid function be improved?, Lancet, 2, pp. 933-935, (1978); Wilke T.J., Estimation of free thyroid hormone concentrations in the clinical laboratory, Clinical Chemistry, 32, pp. 585-592, (1986); Wong E.T., Steffes M.W., A fundamental approach to the diagnosis of diseases of the thyroid gland, Clinical Laboratory Medicine, 4, pp. 655-670, (1984)","V.L.

First, the usefulness of neural networks for use with e-commerce data and for Bayesian classification is discussed. Next, the theory concerning model accuracy and generalization is presented. Then, the principled approach, which is developed with consideration of these issues, is described. Through an illustrative problem, it is seen that when problem complexity is considered, the classification performance of the neural networks can be much better than what is observed. Furthermore, it is seen that model order selection processes based upon a single dataset can lead to an incorrect conclusion concerning the best model, which impacts model error and utility. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study is to investigate factors that predict consumer's intention to adopt m-commerce. The study identifies variables relevant for m-commerce environment and empirically establishes their influence on m-commerce adoption intention. A two-stage analysis comprising of structural equation modelling (SEM) and neural network (NN) technique is employed to test the proposed model. The results obtained from SEM analysis observed that perceived risk is the strongest predictor of m-commerce adoption decision, followed by performance expectancy, variety of services and perceived critical mass. Effort expectancy is found to be statistically insignificant. The significant factors from SEM were used as inputs to NN model and the results established performance expectancy to be the most important input variable in predicting m-commerce adoption intention followed by variety of services, perceived risk and perceived critical mass. The findings of this study are useful for m-commerce marketers and service providers, in developing suitable marketing strategies to scale up their business. This study is one of the few empirical studies conducted in India to examine the adoption intention of m-commerce.

The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making. The use of a novel three-phase decision-making framework which uses AI processes improves operational efficiency, increases insights and enhances the decision accuracy of complex problems at the strategic level in industries such as manufacturing. It could help operations executives to apply effective decisions. © 2021 The Author(s).

The main objective is to model the experts’ classification of consumer's behaviors on apparel goods in terms of their attributes and tastes and then to realize the experts decision making based on a neural network. In the paper the attributes and tastes of consumers, and the classification of the consoumers provided by fashion experts are learned by a neural network model. The learning realizes the latent ability of complex and difficult clustering of consumers by their attributes and tastes which experienced experts have. The paper shows that this model can perform the same ability as fashion experts in the classification of consumers’ behaviors. © 1992, The Japan Research Association for Textile End-Uses.

The integrated approach takes advantage of the synergy between APT and ANN in extracting risk factors, predicting the trend of individual risk factor, generating candidate portfolios, and choosing the optimal portfolio. It uses quadratic programming for identifying surrogate portfolios in APT and ANN to predict factor returns. Empirical results indicate that the integrated method beats the benchmark and outperforms the traditional method that uses the ARIMA model.","Arbitrage pricing theory; Artificial neural networks; Decision support systems; Portfolio management; System integration; Unified programming","Decision making; Management; Marketing; Neural networks; Programming theory; Risk assessment; Arbitrage pricing theory; Portfolio management; Quadratic programming; Decision support systems","","","","","Ministry of Education","from the econometrics programming system (EPS) database maintained by the Ministry of Education.","Box G.E.P., Jenkin G.M., Time Series Analysis - Forecasting and Control, (1976); Brown S.J., Weinstein M.I., A New Approach to Testing Asset Pricing Models: The Bilinear Paradigm, Journal of Finance, 3, pp. 711-743, (1983); Chang S.K., Loo C.H., Chang C.W., The Pricing of Futures Contracts and Arbitrage Pricing Theory, Journal of Financial Research, 13, pp. 297-306, (1990); Chen N.F., Roll R., Ross S.A., Economics Forces and the Stock Market, Journal of Business, 59, pp. 383-403, (1986); Chen N.F., Some Empirical Tests of the Theory of Arbitrage Pricing, Journal of Finance, 38, 5, pp. 1393-1414, (1983); Chen S.J., Jordan B.D., Some empirical tests in the arbitrage pricing theory: Macrovariables vs. derived factors, Journal of Banking and Finance, 17, pp. 65-89, (1993); Cybento G., Approximation by Superposition of a Sigmoidal Function, Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, (1989); Dhrymes P., Friend I., Gultekin B., A Critical Reexamination of the Empirical Evidence of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, Journal of Finance, 39, 2, pp. 323-346, (1984); Fogler H.R., Common Sense on CAPM, APT and Correlated Residuals, Journal of Portfolio Management, pp. 20-28, (1982); Gruber M.J., Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Portfolio Management, The Second International Conference on Asian-Pacific Financial Markets, (1991); Jang G.S., Lai F., Parng T.M., Intelligent Stock Trading Decision Support System Using Dual Adaptive-Structure Neural Networks, Journal of Information Science and Engineering, 9, pp. 271-297, (1993); Jang G.S., Lai F., Jiang B.W., Parng T.M., Intelligent Stock Trading System with Price Trend Prediction and Reversal Recognition Using Dual-Module Neural Networks, Journal of Applied Intelligent, 3, pp. 225-248, (1993); Kaiser H., The Varimax Criterion for Analytic Rotation in Factor Analysis, Psychometrika, 23, pp. 187-200, (1958); Kamijo K., Tanigawa T., Stock Price Pattern Recognition: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 1990, 1, pp. 215-221, (1990); Khanna T., Foundations of Neural Networks, (1989); Kimoto T., Asakawa K., Yoda M., Takeoka M., Stock Market Prediction System with Modular Neural Networks, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 1990, 1, pp. 1-6, (1990); Lee J.K., Song Y.U., Unification of Linear Programming with a Rule-Based System by the Post-Model Analysis Approach, Management Science, 41, 5, pp. 835-847, (1995); Lee J.K., Integration and Competition of Al with Quantitative Methods for Decision Support, Expert Systems with Applications, 1, 4, pp. 1-16, (1990); Lee J.K., Trippi R.R., Chu S.C., Kim H.S., K-FOLIO: Integrating the Markowitz Model with a Knowledge-Based System, The Journal of Portfolio Management, pp. 89-93, (1990); Lehmann B.N., Modest D.M., The Empirical Foundations of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, Journal of Financial Economics, 21, pp. 213-254, (1988); Liang T.P., Moskowitz And H., Yih Y., Integrating Neural Networks and Semi-Markov Process for Automated Knowledge Acquisition: An Application to Real-Time Scheduling, Decision Sciences, 23, 6, pp. 1297-1314, (1992); Lin C.Y., Liu V.W.C., Chu J.F., A Research of Examining the Macroeconomics Factors and Constructing the Optimal Portfolio for the Taiwan Stock Market - Using the Arbitrage Pricing Theory Approach, NSC Report 81-0301-H-110-501, (1992); Matsuba I., Application of Neural Sequential Associator to Long-Term Stock Price Prediction, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 1991, 2, pp. 1196-1201, (1991); McGowan C.B.

A possible oligopolistic market scenario assumes a multiplicity of customers whose choices on a given product set have to be explained; the individual choices of these subjects contribute to defining some market shares to be estimated—with their possible evolution—by a multicriteria model (management’s problem formulation). Very few computer based systems to support such a complex problem are found in literature; developed essentially with “classic” methodologies and techniques, they suffer from considering either one single decisional subject (the market/consumer) or a multiplicity of monocriterion choices under uncertainty conditions, without taking into account any integrated representation wich might permit a multiactorial interpretation of “the market” to be given. An approach based on neural networks seems to allow such limits to be overcome, as it has been applied successfully to design and develop a prototype of DSS (MUTANT) for the problem formulated. Some first computational experiments allow some positive judgements to be expressed about the system’s validity and the promising potentialities of a new “modelling and problem solving” approach that might be usefully applied so as to enlarge some potentialities of other multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) methods. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Explicative models; Multicriteria decisions; Multiple choices; Neural networks","","","","","","MURST; Ministry of University and Scientific Research","(**) This research has been conducted within a program supported by the Ministry of University and Scientific Research (MURST 60 %)","Blin J.M., Dodson J.A., The relationship between attribute brand preference, and choice: a stochastic view, Management Science, 26, 6, pp. 606-619, (1980); Boscarino M., Multiple Choices in an Oligopolistic Market: Explicative Models and Neural Networks (In Italian), (1991); Gianoglio P., Ostanello A., Multiple Choices in an Oligopolistic Market: Explicative Models and Neural Networks, (1993); Czogala E., Roubens M., An approach to multiple-criteria decision making problems using probabilistic set theory, European Journal of Operational Research, 43, pp. 263-266, (1989); D'Avignon G.R., Vincke P., An outranking method under uncertainty, European Journal of Operational Research, 36, pp. 311-321, (1988); Diederich J., Explanation and artificial neural networks, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 37, 3, pp. 335-355, (1992); Seo F., Sakawa M., Fuzzy multiattribute utility analysis for collective choice, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC-15, 1, pp. 45-53, (1985); Hornik K., Stinchcombe M., White H., Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, 2, pp. 359-366, (1989); Jacquet-Lagreze E., PREFCALC, (1983); Jacquet-Lagreze E., Siskos J., Assessing a set of additive utility functions for multicriteria decision-making, European Journal of Operational Research, 10, pp. 151-164, (1982); Kandel E.R., Schwartz J.H., Jessel T.M., Principles of Neural Science, (1991); Landry M., Malouin J.L., Oral M., Model validation in operations research, European Journal of Operational Research, 14, pp. 207-220, (1983); Levine D.S., Introduction to Neural and Cognitive Modeling, (1991); Lippman R.P., An Introduction to computing with neural networks, IEEE Acoustics, pp. 4-12, (1987); Moreno Davila J., Revel P., Un algoritmo di tipo Montecarlo par la simulazione di un sistema di equazioni non lineari, Informatica, pp. 161-167, (1972); Neuralworks Professional II/PLUS, (1991); Ostanello A., Revel P., On a Project of DSS for Strategic Marketing and Product Planning Decisions in a Oligopolistic Market, (1988); Peng Y., Reggia J.A., A connectionist model for diagnostic problem solving, IEEE.
