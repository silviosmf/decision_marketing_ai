This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Genetic fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; KDD; Management support; Unsupervised learning","","","","","","Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia, (TIN2008-06681-CO6-01, TIN2008-06681-CO6-05); Generalitat de Catalunya, (2005SGR-00302); Junta de Andalucía, (P07-TIC-3185)","The authors would like to thank Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia for its support under projects TIN2008-06681-CO6-01 and TIN2008-06681-CO6-05 , Generalitat de Catalunya for its support under grant 2005SGR-00302 , and Junta de Andalucía for its support under project P07-TIC-3185 .

The main idea is to decompose the data into a two-dimensional type, centroid and its length (area). The two-dimensional questionnaires this study proposes help reaching market information. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making; Fuzzy data; Fuzzy statistics; Marketing research","","","","","","","","Carlsson C., Fuller R., Benchmarking in linguistic importance weighted aggregations, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 114, pp. 35-41, (2000); Carlsson C., Fuller R., Multiobjective linguistic optimization, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 115, pp. 5-10, (2000); Chiang D.A., Chow L.R., Wang Y.F., Mining time series data by a fuzzy linguistic summary system, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 112, pp. 419-432, (2000); Claessens B.J.C., van Eerde W., Rutte C.G., Roe R.A., Planning behavior and perceived control of time at work, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 937-950, (2004); Costas C.S.L., Maranon P.P., Cabrera J.A.H., Application of diffuse measurement to the evaluation of psychological structures, Quality and Quantity, 28, pp. 305-313, (1994); Herrera F., Herrera-Viedma E., Linguistic decision analysis: Steps for solving decision problems under linguistic information, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 116, pp. 67-82, (2000); Hesketh B., Pryor R., Gleitzman M., Hesketh T., Practical applications and psychometric evaluation of a computerized fuzzy graphic ration scale, Fuzzy Sets in Psychology, pp. 425-454, (1988); Kahraman C., Yavuz M., Production engineering and management under fuzziness, (2010); Lee Y.-L., Chang D.-F., Wu B., Evaluating management performance and marking strategies in community colleges, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 8, 10, pp. 7405-7415, (2012); Macan T.H., Time-management training: Effects on time behaviors, attitudes, and job performance, The Journal of Psychology, 130, pp. 229-236, (1996); Nguyen H., Wu B., Random and fuzzy sets in coarse data analysis, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 51, pp. 70-85, (2006); Nguyen H., Wu B., Fundamentals of statistics with fuzzy data, (2006); Nguyen H., Kreinovich V., Wu B., Gang X., Computing statistics under interval and fuzzy uncertainty, (2011); Peeters M.A.G., Rutte C.G., Time management behaviour as a moderator for the job-demand-control interaction, Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 10, pp. 64-75, (2005); Strongman K.T., Burt C.D.B., Taking breaks from work: An exploratory inquiry, The Journal of Psychology, 134, pp. 229-242, (2000); Wu B., Tseng N., A new approach to fuzzy regression models with application to business cycle analysis, Fuzzy Sets and System, 130, pp. 33-42, (2002); Wu B., Mei F.L., Zhong Y.W., Efficiency evaluation in time management for school administration with fuzzy data, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 8, 8, pp. 5787-5795, (2012)","B.

Finding communities in real-world networks is critical for analyzing complex systems in various areas ranging from collaborative information to political systems. Given the different characteristics of networks and the capability of community detection in handling a plethora of societal problems, community detection methods represent an emerging area of research. Contributing to this field, the authors propose a new community detection algorithm based on the hybridization of node and link granulation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed algorithm utilizes a rough set-theoretic concept called closure on networks. Initial sets are constructed by using neighborhood topology around the nodes as well as links and represented as two different categories of granules. Subsequently, the authors iteratively obtain the constrained closure of these sets. The authors use node mutuality and link mutuality as merging criteria for node and link granules, respectively, during the iterations. Finally, the constrained closure subsets of nodes and links are combined and refined using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and a local density function to obtain communities in a binary network. Findings: Extensive experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks followed by a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research limitations/implications: The study also contributes to the ongoing effort related to the application of soft computing techniques to model complex systems. The extant literature has integrated a rough set-theoretic approach with a fuzzy granular model (Kundu and Pal, 2015) and spectral clustering (Huang and Xiao, 2012) for node-centric community detection in complex networks. In contributing to this stream of work, the proposed algorithm leverages the unexplored synergy between rough set theory, node granulation and link granulation in the context of complex networks. Combined with experiments of network datasets from various domains, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal co-occurring disjoint, overlapping and nested communities without necessarily assigning each node to a community. Practical implications: This study carries important practical implications for complex adaptive systems in business and management sciences, in which entities are increasingly getting organized into communities (Jacucci et al., 2006). The proposed community detection method can be used for network-based fraud detection by enabling experts to understand the formation and development of fraudulent setups with an active exchange of information and resources between the firms (Van Vlasselaer et al., 2017). Products and services are getting connected and mapped in every walk of life due to the emergence of a variety of interconnected devices, social networks and software applications. Social implications: The proposed algorithm could be extended for community detection on customer trajectory patterns and design recommendation systems for online products and services (Ghose et al., 2019; Liu and Wang, 2017). In line with prior research, the proposed algorithm can aid companies in investigating the characteristics of implicit communities of bloggers or social media users for their services and products so as to identify peer influencers and conduct targeted marketing (Chau and Xu, 2012; De Matos et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). The proposed algorithm can be used to understand the behavior of each group and the appropriate communication strategy for that group. For instance, a group using a specific language or following a specific account might benefit more from a particular piece of content than another group. The proposed algorithm can thus help in exploring the factors defining communities and confronting many real-life challenges. Originality/value: This work is based on a theoretical argument that communities in networks are not only based on compatibility among nodes but also on the compatibility among links. Building up on the aforementioned argument, the authors propose a community detection method that considers the relationship among both the entities in a network (nodes and links) as opposed to traditional methods, which are predominantly based on relationships among nodes only. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cohesion;

Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Canary islands; Customer satisfaction; Hotel; Machine learning; Market segmentation; Multi-criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preferences analysis","Canary Islands; Spain; hotel industry; Internet; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; preference behavior; tourist behavior","","","","","","","Agha M.S., Alnahhal M.J., Agha S.R., Alafeefy A.S., Industrial sectors eligibility for rehabilitation programs: an integrated AHP – TODIM approach, Int.

An algorithm is proposed, and the results of case studies on predicting the effectiveness and optimal organization of team thinking, as well as designing team solutions using the technical package of social technologies are presented. They are exemplified by developing a system of products and marketing channels (points of contact) of an employer brand (EB) of an organization for individual stakeholder groups. An algorithm has been developed for using a system of hybrid ""soft computing"" technologies and system-creative thinking in supply chain process of project teamwork; practical calculations have been carried out using this algorithm. The algorithm and systems of models for using ""soft computing"" for supply chain developed allow us to obtain a synergistic effect from controlling a system of hybrid technologies at various stages of teamwork. The package includes a ""basic"" technology comprising ""training teams"", and also the formation of a KPI system that characterize team work (units 1 and 2), ""product"" technologies comprising analysis of team organization thinking, forecasting team performance, team productivity management, as well as supply chain management of project (units 4, 5, 6), and also ""closing"" technology being a strategizing (adaptive management) of team work (dynamic control of the algorithm as a whole). © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Decision packages; Employer brand (EB); Employer brand products (EB products); Hybrid soft computing technologies; Supply chain management; Touch points","","","","","","","","Avdeeva Z.K., Kovriga S.V., Makarenko D.I., Maksimov V.I., Cognitive approach to management, Problems of management, 3, (2007); Kabanov P., Khairutdinova L., Bulanova L., Criminological Characteristics of Migrant Crimes: Russian and Foreign Practices, International Journal of Criminology and Sociology, 9, pp. 16-25, (2020); Belbin R., Types of roles in management teams, (2003); Zaretsky V.K., If the situation seems unsolvable, (2011); Klimova S.G., Mikheenkova M.A., Finn V.K., The JSM method in qualitative sociological research: Basic principles and experience of use, Sociological Journal, 22, 2, (2016); Kotler F., Cartajaya H., Setiavan A., Marketing 4.0.

Brand-managing activities are typically related to brand positioning and integration with marketing campaigns, and can involve complex decisions. The branding of an organization is indeed a dynamic system with many cause-effect relationships as well as intangible and heterogeneous variables. In order to help brand managers and marketers, we propose a decision support system, named Identimod, for modeling and evaluating branding strategies. Identimod uses non-linear dynamic modeling and soft computing to identify the branding system from different data sources through a linguistic user interface, and to provide advanced methods for diagnostics and validation. Identimod steps through a participatory, cyclic, and iterative process consisting of four different modules to increase the confidence and validity of the model, which should facilitate its acceptance by managers and stakeholders. Throughout this paper we demonstrate the modeling process and managerial benefits of Identimod by forming and answering the marketing questions for a real rebranding case of a seafood company in Spain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Branding; Decision support systems; Marketing; Soft computing","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Iterative methods; Managers; Marketing; Soft computing; User interfaces; Branding; Branding strategies; Cause-effect relationships; Complex decision; Iterative process; Marketing campaign; Modeling process; Non-linear dynamics; Decision support systems","","","","","RØD Brand Consultants; ZIO; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (TIN2015-67661); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work has been supported by RØD Brand Consultants (ZIO research contract) and the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad under NEWSOCO project (ref.

Design/methodology/approach - Through standardized measurement system, the authors come up with real-value data to satisfy not the current needs but data itself. This is when fuzzy classification stands out and highlights the area of in-between and undefined. Findings - The proposed metric system helps the authors to assess the distance among trapezoidal fuzzy data. The index of efficiency between observed time and ideal time is also presented. Originality/value - With the ranking of fuzzy sample, the authors can examine the decision process by non-parametric testing hypothesis. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Efficiency evaluation; Fuzzy sets; Index of efficiency; Time management","","","","","","","","Adams G.A., Jex S.M., Relationships between time management, control, workfamily conflict, and strain, Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1, 1, pp. 72-77, (1999); Ancona D.G., Goodman P.S., Lawrence B.S., Tushman M.L., Time: A new research lens, Academy of Management Review, 26, 4, pp. 645-663, (2001); Burt C.D.B., Kemp S., Construction of activity duration and time management potential, Applied Cognitive Psychology, 8, 2, pp. 155-168, (1994); Carlsson C., Fuller R., Benchmarking in linguistic importance weighted aggregations, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 114, 1, pp. 35-41, (2000); Carlsson C., Fuller R., Multiobjective linguistic optimization, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 115, 1, pp. 5-10, (2000); Chiang D.A., Chow L.R., Wang Y.F., Mining time series data by a fuzzy linguistic summary system, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 112, 4, pp. 419-432, (2000); Claessens B.J.C., van Eerde W., Rutte C.G., Roe R.A., Planning behavior and perceived control of time at work, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 25, 8, pp. 937-950, (2004); Costas C.S.L., Maranon P.P., Cabrera J.A.H., Application of diffuse measurement to the evaluation of psychological structures, Quality and Quantity, 28, 3, pp. 305-313, (1994); Francis-Smythe J.A., Robertson I.T., On the relationship between time management and time estimation, British Journal of Psychology, 90, 3, pp. 333-347, (1999); George J.M., Jones G.R., The role of time in theory and theory building, Journal of Management, 26, 4, pp. 657-684, (2000); Herrera F., Herrera-Viedma E., Linguistic decision analysis: Steps for solving decision problems under linguistic information, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 116, 1, pp. 67-82, (2000); Hesketh B., Pryor R., Gleitzman M., Hesketh T., Practical applications and psychometric evaluation of a computerized fuzzy graphic ration scale, Fuzzy Sets in Psychology, pp. 425-454, (1988); Kahraman C., Yavuz M., Production Engineering and Management under Fuzziness, (2010); Kaufman-Scarborough C., Lindquist J.D., Time management and polychronicity: Comparisons, contrasts, and insights for the workplace, Journal of Managerial Psychology, 14, 3, pp. 288-312, (1999); Kumar A., Singh P., Kaur A., Kaur P., RM approach for ranking of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Fuzzy Information and Engineering, 2, 1, pp. 37-47, (2010); Lee Y.-L., Chang D.-F., Wu B., Evaluating management performance and marking strategies in community colleges, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 8, 10B, pp. 7405-7415, (2012); Liu H., Wu B., Liu M., Investors’ preference order of fuzzy numbers, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 55, 11, pp. 2623-2630, (2008); Macan T.H., Time-management training: Effects on time behaviors, attitudes, and job performance, The Journal of Psychology, 130, 3, pp. 229-236, (1996); Nguyen H., Wu B., Random and fuzzy sets in coarse data analysis, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 51, 1, pp. 70-85, (2006); Nguyen H., Wu B., Fundamentals of Statistics with Fuzzy Data, (2006); Nguyen H., Kreinovich V., Wu B., Xiang G., Computing Statistics under Interval and Fuzzy Uncertainty, (2011); Peeters M.A.G., Rutte C.G., Time management behaviour as a moderator for the jobdemand- control interaction, Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 10, pp. 64-75, (2005); Ramli N., Mohamad D., A comparative analysis of centroid methods in ranking fuzzy numbers, European Journal of Scientific Research, 28, 3, pp. 492-501, (2009); Samuels C., Managers help leaders balance time, EducationWeek, 27, 23, pp. 18-19, (2008); Strongman K.T., Burt C.D.B., Taking breaks from work: An exploratory inquiry, Journal of Psychology, 134, 3, pp. 229-242, (2000); Williams R.L., Verble J.S., Price D.E., Layne B.H., Relationship between time management practices and personality indices and types, Journal of Psychological Type, 34, 1, pp. 36-42, (1995); Wright T.A., Dialogue: The importance of time in organizational research, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 3, pp. 343-345, (2002); Wu B., Liu M.F., Wang Z.Y., Efficiency evaluation in time management for school administration with fuzzy data, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 8, 8, pp. 5787-5795, (2012); Zijlstra F.R.H., Roe R.A., Leonora A.B., Krediet I., Temporal factors in mental work: Effects of interrupted activities, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 72, pp. 163-185, (1999); Liu X., Han S., Ranking fuzzy numbers with preference weighting function expectations, Comput.
