The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of new factors which have relation to a client’s creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client’s creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The knowledge gained from the evaluation model is immediately possible to use in the strategic management of insurance companies e.g. in marketing activities. © 2017, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Performance measures are simple quantities that indicate the state of manufacturing organisations and are used as the basis of decision-making at this crucial early stage of the process. Fuzzy set theory is a method for using qualitative data and subjective opinion. Fuzzy sets have been used extensively in manufacturing for applications including control, decision-making, and estimation. Type-2 fuzzy sets are a novel extension of type-1 fuzzy sets. Aims to examine this subject. Design/methodology/approach - This research explores the increased use of type-2 fuzzy sets in manufacturing. In particular, type-2 fuzzy sets are used to model ""the words that mean different things to different people"". Findings - A model that can leverage design process knowledge and predict time to market from performance measures is a potentially valuable tool for decision making and continuous improvement. A number of data sources, such as process maps, from previous research into time to market in a high technology products company, are used to structure and build a type-2 fuzzy logic model for the prediction of time to market. Originality/value - This paper presents a demonstration of how the type-2 fuzzy logic model works and provides directions for further research into the design process for time to market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fuzzy logic; Time to market","Decision making; Forecasting; Formal logic; Fuzzy sets; Process control; Product development; Time series analysis; Process maps; Qualitative data; Time to market; Type-2 fuzzy sets; Marketing","","","","","","","Bicheno J., The Lean Toolbox, (2000); Doctor F., Hagras H., Callaghan V., A type-2 fuzzy embedded agent to realise ambient intelligence in ubiquitous computing environments, Information Sciences, 171, 4, pp. 309-334, (2005); Huarng K., Yu H.-K., A type-2 fuzzy time series model for stock index forecasting, Physica A, 353, pp. 445-462, (2005); Jahan-Shahi H., Shayan E., Masood S.H., Multi-valued fuzzy sets in cost/time estimation of flat plate processing, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 17, 10, pp. 751-759, (2001); Karnik N.N., Mendel J.M., Operations on type-2 fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 122, 2, pp. 327-348, (2001); Koliza V., Pearce D., Khoudian P., Page T., Formulation of a calculation for identifying actual and potential costs caused by delays in the new product introduction process, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Manufacturing Research, University of Strathclyde, pp. 229-233, (2003); Kratschmer V., Limit theorems for fuzzy random variables, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 126, 2, pp. 253-263, (2002); Maskell B., Baggaley B., Practical Lean Accounting, (2004); Mendel J.M., Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems, (2001); Mendel J., John R.I., Type-2 fuzzy sets made simple, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 10, 2, pp. 117-127, (2002); Nojiri H., A model of the executive's decision processes in new product development, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 7, pp. 227-241, (1982); Park K.S., Kim S.H., A note on the fuzzy weighted average rule, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 77, 3, pp. 315-320, (1996); Turksen I.B., Type-2 representation and meaning for CWW, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 127, 1, pp. 17-36, (2002); Walker C.L., Walker E.A., The algebra of fuzzy truth values, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 149, 2, pp. 309-347, (2005); Yager R.R., Noble reinforcement in disjunctive aggregation operators, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 11, 6, pp. 754-767, (2003)","P.

The analysis is based on information obtained by direct inquiry to 99 small producers in the region, about planning, production, marketing and distribution in the chain, supplemented with secondary information sources. Design/methodology/approach: As a methodology an analysis of maturity in the chain based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration is done, whose evaluation is later analyzed as a fuzzy logic model, with the support of the fuzzy logic of the MATLAB toolbox, to study the convenience of the use of the contract against the other mechanisms, and to establish an approximation to the level of readiness of the chain toward integration. Findings: Results obtained show that the small farmer supply chain studied, from a maturity perspective, has a strong disposition for the use of contracts as an integration mechanism. Research limitations/implications: The supply chain for small producers presents a high dispersion, little consolidated offer capacity and lack of coordination. Limitations in terms of information and criteria unification are a challenge for future research. Results have socioeconomic implications for small producers and can serve as a guide to formulate policies by the governments in Latin American countries. Practical implications: As practical implications, it can be stated that the use of supply contracts is a real mechanism that can be implemented in this type of chain, to break the mistrust between the echelons and improve the supply chain performance. This research will allow to establish support programs from local governments for the sustainability and improving income of small producers. In addition, contracts will allow to formalize the linkage of small producers to a sustainable commercial network. Social implications: Small agricultural producers in developing countries live in unfavorable conditions, with socioeconomic limitations. This work offers an alternative for their productive activity development that will allow them access to marketing chains in a safe way and improve their living conditions. Originality/value: Previous studies related to the maturity toward the chain integration and fuzzy logic as a hybrid methodology, were not found in the literature, and less even applied to a chain of small agricultural products. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Integration; Maturity model; Supply chain","","","","","","Mayor’s Office of the Municipality of Andalucia Valle del Cauca; Zanjón de Piedras","The authors would like to thank the following: ASOHOFRUCOL Valle del Cauca and its director, Engineer Juan Carlos Valencia; Secretariat of Economic Development of the Mayor’s Office of the Municipality of Andalucia Valle del Cauca; the ASOCAMPOALEGRE association led by the Agricultural Administrator Manuel Andrés Jiménez Hidalgo and its board of directors; Mr. Wilmer Viedma Murillo, president of the Valle del Cauca citrus committee and Mr. Aldemar from ASOCAMPOALEGRE, who was the guide in each of the extensive days of interviewing group for the collection of information.

Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed statistical methods, such as regression or autoregressive and moving average (ARMA). However, sales forecasting is very complicated owing to influence by internal and external environments. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have also been applied in sales forecasting since their promising performances in the areas of control and pattern recognition. However, further improvement is still necessary since unique circumstances, e.g., promotion, cause a sudden change in the sales pattern. Thus, this study utilizes fuzzy logic a proposed fuzzy neural network (FNN) for the sake of learning fuzzy IF-THEN rules obtained from the marketing experts with respect to promotion. The result from FNN is further integrated with the forecast from ANN using the time series data and the promotion length through the other ANN. Model evaluation results indicate that the proposed system can more accurately perform than the conventional statistical method and single ANN. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The system makes use of data collected from the franchising business and external environment analysis for decision making in center positioning problems. The fuzzy logic approach is integrated into the system for analyzing the geographical market dynamics including profitability and competitiveness in the district concerned. To demonstrate the application of the proposed FDSS, a case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based franchising private education center, i.e. Dr I-Kids Education Center. Findings - The tailor made FDSS helps to facilitate the business operations of the franchising education center and develops a district positioning model for the centers located in the 18 districts of Hong Kong. The findings provide a solid foundation for marketing strategy and expansion direction formulation. Originality/value - Due to the globalization of business, managing a growing franchising business model becomes challenging to the franchisor. In order to fully leverage the merits of the franchising system, an intelligent decision support model, focusing on making strategic development plans, is needed so as to expand the scale of business efficiently. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Franchising model; Fuzzy logic","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer circuits; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Marketing; Planning; Decision supports; Design/methodology/approach; Development planning; External environments; Fuzzy logic approach; Intelligent decision support; Strategic development; Strategy formulations; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Aliouche E.H., Schlentrich U.A., Towards a strategic model of global franchise expansion, Journal of Retailing, 87, 3, pp. 345-365, (2011); Altinay L., Okumus F., Franchise partner selection decision making, The Service Industries Journal, 31, 6, pp. 929-946, (2010); Anagnostopoulos K., Doukas H., Psarras J., A linguistic multicriteria analysis system combining fuzzy sets theory, ideal and anti-ideal points for location site selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 35, 4, pp. 2041-2048, (2008); Arnott D., Pervan G., Eight key issues for the decision support systems discipline, Decision Support Systems, 44, 3, pp. 657-672, (2008); Azaron A., Brown K.N., Tarim S.A., Modarres M., A multi-objective stochastic programming approach for supply chain design considering risk, International Journal of Production Economics, 116, 1, pp. 129-138, (2008); Barthelemy J., Opportunism, knowledge, and the performance of franchise chains, Strategic Management Journal, 29, 13, pp. 1451-1463, (2008); Batanovic V., Petrovic D., Petrovic R., Fuzzy logic based algorithms for maximum covering location problems, Information Sciences, 179, 1-2, pp. 120-129, (2009); Bordonaba-Juste V., Polo-Redondo Y., The effect of relationship marketing strategy on franchise channels: Evidence from spanish franchisees, Journal of Marketing Channels, 15, 1, pp. 71-91, (2008); Bordonaba-Juste V., Lucia-Palacios L., Polo-Redondo Y., Influence of franchisors' competitive strategies on network size: The impact of entry timing decision, Journal of Marketing Channels, 17, 1, pp. 33-49, (2010); Bordonaba-Juste V., Lucia-Palacios L., Polo-Redondo Y., An analysis of franchisor failure risk: Evidence from Spain, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 26, 6, pp. 407-420, (2011); Cadez S., Guilding C., Strategy, strategic management accounting and performance: A configurational analysis, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 112, 3, pp. 484-501, (2012); Chou D.C., Lin B., Development of web-based knowledge management systems, Human Systems Management, 21, 3, pp. 153-158, (2002); Cochet O., Garg V.K., How do franchise contracts evolve?

To solve this problem, digital marketing strategies (DMSs) can increase the chances of success of tourism companies in this condition. Therefore, accurate DMS selection is an essential factor in improving the situation of tourism companies. The purpose of this study is to identify and prioritise DMSs in the tourism industry. For this purpose, after identifying the strategies and evaluation criteria of the strategies, the fuzzy Delphi method is used to screen them. Subsequently, using Fuzzy SWARA, the criteria are weighted according to experts. Next, DMSs in the Iranian tourism industry are ranked using Fuzzy ARAS, Fuzzy COPRAS, Fuzzy TOPSIS, and Fuzzy VIKOR. Finally, the results provide insights into both managerial and theoretical dimensions for future work and improving business performance in the tourism industry.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","digital marketing strategies;

Furthermore, existing research does not recognize the group decision-making nature and the possibility of customer involvement in celebrity or influencer selection for social media marketing. This study conceptualizes celebrity selection as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem while deriving the final ranking of celebrities/influencers using interactive and flexible criteria based on the value tradeoff approach. The article thus proposes and demonstrates a quantitative objective method of celebrity selection for a brand or campaign in an interactive manner incorporating customer's preferences as well. Design/methodology/approach: Each decision-maker's preferences for celebrity selection criteria are objectively captured and converted into an overall group preference using a modified generalized fuzzy evaluation method (MGFEM). The final ranking of celebrities is then derived from an interactive and criteria-based value tradeoff approach using the flexible and interactive tradeoff method. Findings: The approach gives a different ranking of celebrities for two campaigns based on group members' perceived importance of the selection criteria in different scenarios. This group includes decision-makers (DMs) from the brand, marketing communication agency and brand's customers. Further, each group member has an almost equal say in the decision-making based on fuzzy evaluation and an interactive and flexible value tradeoff approach to celebrity selection for receiving a rank order. Research limitations/implications: The approach uses secondary data on celebrities and hypothetical scenarios. Comparison with other methods is difficult, as no other study proposes a multi-criteria group decision-making approach to celebrity selection especially in a social media context. Practical implications: This approach can help DMs make more informed, objective and effective decisions on celebrity selection for their brands or campaigns. It recognizes that there are multiple stakeholders, including the end customers, each of whose views is objectively considered in the aspects of group decision-making through a fuzzy evaluation method. Further, this study provides a selection mechanism for a given context of endorsement by objectively and interactively encapsulating stakeholder preferences. Originality/value: This robust and holistic approach to celebrity selection can help DMs objectively make consensual decisions with partial or complete information. This quantitative approach contributes to the literature on selection mechanisms of influencers, celebrities, social media opinion leaders etc. by providing a methodological aid that encompasses aspects of interactive group decision-making for a given context. Moreover, this method is useful to DMs and stakeholders in understanding and incorporating the effect of nature or context of the brand and the campaign type in the selection of a celebrity or an influencer. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Celebrity selection; FITradeoff; Fuzzy logic; Group decision-making; Multi-attribute; Social media marketing campaign","","","","","","","","Aggrawal N., Arora A., Anand A., Irshad M.S., View-count based modeling for YouTube videos and weighted criteria–based ranking, Advanced Mathematical Techniques in Engineering Sciences, pp. 149-160, (2018); Agrawal J., Kamakura W.A., The economic worth of celebrity endorsers: an event study analysis, Journal of Marketing, 59, 3, (1995); Akdevelioglu D., Kara S., An international investigation of opinion leadership and social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 1, pp. 71-88, (2020); Al-Emadi F.A., Yahia I.B., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); de Almeida A.T., Roselli L.R.P., Visualization for decision support in FITradeoff method: exploring its evaluation with cognitive neuroscience, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 282, pp. 61-73, (2017); de Almeida A.T., de Almeida J.A., Costa A.P.C.S., de Almeida-Filho A.T., A new method for elicitation of criteria weights in additive models: flexible and interactive tradeoff, European Journal of Operational Research, 250, 1, pp. 179-191, (2016); Amos C., Holmes G., Strutton D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness: a quantitative synthesis of effect size, International Journal of Advertising, 27, 2, pp. 209-234, (2008); Arora A., Bansal S., Kandpal C., Aswani R., Dwivedi Y., Measuring social media influencer index-insights from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101, (2019); Atkin C., Block M., Effectiveness of celebrity endorsers, Journal of Advertising Research, 23, 3, pp. 57-61, (1983); Atlam H.F., Walters R.J., Wills G.B., Daniel J., Fuzzy logic with expert judgment to implement an adaptive risk-based access control model for IoT, Mobile Networks and Applications, (2019); Bamakan S.M.H., Nurgaliev I., Qu Q., Opinion leader detection: a methodological review, Expert Systems with Applications, 115, pp. 200-222, (2019); Bang H.J., Lee W.-N., Consumer response to Ads in social network sites: an exploration into the role of Ad location and path, Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising, 37, 1, pp. 1-14, (2016); Bao Z., Wang D., Examining consumer participation on brand microblogs in China: perspectives from elaboration likelihood model, commitment–trust theory and social presence, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 15, 1, pp. 10-29, (2021); Bergkvist L., Zhou K.Q., Celebrity endorsements: a literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Advertising, 35, 4, pp. 642-663, (2016); Biswas R., An application of fuzzy sets in students' evaluation, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 74, pp. 187-194, (1995); Boerman S.C., Willemsen L.M., Van Der Aa E.P., ‘This post is sponsored’: effects of sponsorship disclosure on persuasion knowledge and electronic word of mouth in the context of Facebook, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 38, pp. 82-92, (2017); Britt R.K., Hayes J.L., Britt B.C., Park H., Too Big to Sell?

Such a complex problem of vagueness and uncertainty can be handled by the theory of fuzzy logic. In this paper, a new fuzzy logic based methodology using a S-curve membership function is used to solve a fuzzy mix product selection problem in industrial engineering. Profits and satisfaction levels have been computed using a fuzzy linear programming approach. Since there are several decisions to be taken, a performance measure has been defined to identify the decision that achieves a high level of profit with a high degree of satisfaction.","Decision making; Fuzzy linear programming; Performance measure; S-curve membership function","","","","","","","","","P.

The aim therefore is to analyze to what extent international tourists visiting South Africa are satisfied by using fuzzy numbers. The measurement of satisfaction with tourist destinations (DSAT)is based on a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (F-MCDM)model that evaluates DSAT according to a number of different segments based on gender, age, and mother tongue. We find empirical evidence for DSAT differences between the segments considered in the analysis. Results show that females are more satisfied than males; tourists between 56 and 65 years old are the most satisfied, while millennials younger than 35 are the least satisfied; English mother-tongue speakers are more satisfied than other tourists. Our findings have clear implications for DMOs' managers regarding the design of marketing campaigns for South African destinations, especially for those segments analyzed in the study. Proposals for future research will also be outlined. © 2019 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION","Destination satisfaction; Fuzzy logic; Market segmentation; South Africa;

Despite the great advantages provided by online shopping for either consumers or retailers, there are certain issues that must be solved to improve online shopping advantages. Finding right size is one of the biggest barriers against apparel online retailing. Since the use of apparels is directly related with fitting, choosing right size is becoming more critical for retailers and consumers. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the solution of the problem. Design/methodology/approach: For the study, the specific size measurements of male shirts (collar, shoulder, chest, waist, arm length in cm) from four different sizes (small, medium, large, x-large) and from eight different brands were collected and stored in a database. Totally, weight, height and body measurements (collar, shoulder, chest, waist and arm length in cm) of 80 male candidates, between the ages of 18 and 35, were measured individually. These data were then used for experiments. Findings: Any product with known measurements can be compared with users’ body measurement based on fuzzy logic rule and the best-fitted size can be selected for users. Similarly, using the proposed web design, users are able to see desired products on users with similar body type. Originality/value: In this study, a new mathematical method based on fuzzy relations for apparel size finder is proposed. Beside, this method can group users based on body measurements in order to find people with similar size. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apparel size; Fitting; Fuzzy modelling; Online marketing","Clothes;

Marketing decision makers constantly need to monitor changes in the environment and organization to make necessary changes. Therefore, a knowledge management (KM) system is required to acquire, store, retrieve and use up-to-date knowledge. Corporations also tend to look for systems to assist them in knowledge management. Agent technology looks set for assisting organizations in collecting, processing and using knowledge with high accuracy, speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for marketing decision making through using agent technology, fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy AHP is used for allocating the weight of determinant criteria and fuzzy logic is deployed for determining the final decision in pessimistic, moderate and optimistic satiations. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) developing a knowledge management framework for capturing, storing, disseminating and utilizing marketing knowledge by using agent system, and (b) helping marketing decision makers to make effective decisions based on useful knowledge, and (c) encouraging marketing decisions towards the intelligence. Implementation of the proposed system in a car factory indicates that it is efficient and effective in supporting and improving marketing decision making. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study has proposed a brand new and practical fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) based weighted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model for application in K-means algorithm for auto insurance customers' segmentation. The developed methodology has been implemented for a private auto insurance company in Iran which classified customers into four ""best"", ""new"", ""risky"", and ""uncertain"" patterns. Then, association rules among auto insurance services in two most valuable customer segments including ""best"" and ""risky"" patterns are discovered and proposed. Finally, some marketing strategies based on the research results are proposed. The authors believe the result of this paper can provide a noticeable capability to the insurer company in order to assess its customers' loyalty in marketing strategy.

It has been identified the main criteria for evaluating the fitness service by customers in process of decisions and selection of the fitness facilities for a visit Surveys of the youth segment of fitness consumers in Kharkiv were conducted and results were processed. The fitness clubs were studied in terms of communicative components of social media marketing to improve their interaction with customers. The research goal was the development computer model for multi-criteria evaluation of fitness centers and their work from clients point of view. As a modeling methodology, we proposed use fuzzy logic. As the instrument for implementation of the model specialized software FuzzyToolBox was chosen. Originally put forward the hypothesis about the possibility, reliability, simplicity and effectiveness of such an approach to modeling of the consumer evaluation of the fitness service, was confirmed as a result of the numerical calculations for fitness clubs in Kharkiv. The developed model can be applied to thetasks of multicriteria estimation of similar services provided to the population of different categories, such as: Health-improving sports activities, outdoor activities, spa, water procedures, mass physical training, health-improving, rehabilitation gymnastics, amateur sports etc. © 2020 Dorokhova Liudmyla et al., published by Sciendo.","consumer behaviour;

Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products. With the massive amount of data available from the cloud, which were conventionally made with a high degree of intuition based on decision makers’ knowledge and experience, can now be supported with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach in applying the fuzzy association rule mining approach and the fuzzy logic technique, for discovering the factors influencing the pricing decision of products launched in e-commerce retail site, and in formulating flexible, dynamic pricing strategies for each product launched in an e-commerce site. A pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses, namely Smart-Quo, is developed and implemented in a Hong Kong-based B2B e-commerce retail company. A six-month pilot run reveals a significant improvement in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness in making pricing decisions on each product. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques in marketing management in today’s digital age. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence;

First, a hybrid intelligent system for developing marketing strategy, called MarStra (developed by the author), is outlined. Then discusses the real-world tests of MarStra with marketing directors in five large UK companies. Empirical evidence from the companies involved indicates that MarStra is very helpful and useful in: providing strategic analysis guidance; coupling strategic analysis with managerial judgement; helping strategic thinking; dealing with fuzziness and uncertainty; and supporting group assessment of strategic marketing factors. The intelligent outputs generated by MarStra were reported to be surprisingly accurate, mostly sound and useful prompts. © 2000, MCB UP Limited","Decision-support systems; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid systems; Marketing strategy","","","","","","","","Alpar P., Knowledge-based modelling of marketing managers’ problem-solving behaviour, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 8, pp. 5-16; Arinze B., Marketing planning with computer models: a case study in the software industry, Industrial Marketing Management, 19, 2, pp. 117-129, (1990); Belardo S., Duchessi P., Coleman J.R., A strategic decision support system at Orell Fussli, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10, 4, pp. 135-157, (1994); Borch O.J., Hartvigsen G., Knowledge-based systems for strategic market planning in small firms, Decision Support Systems, 7, 2, pp. 145-157, (1991); Borenstein D., Towards a practical method to validate decision support systems, Decision Support Systems, 23, pp. 227-239, (1998); Chien T.W., Lin V., Tan B., Lee W.C., A neural networks-based approach for strategic planning, Information & Management, 35, pp. 357-364, (1999); Curry B., Moutinho L., Davies F., Constructing a knowledge base for a marketing expert system, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 10, 11, pp. 12-20, (1992); Day G.S., Strategic Market Planning: The Pursuit of Competitive Advantage, (1984); Duan Y., Burrell P., A hybrid system for strategic marketing planning, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 13, 11, pp. 5-12, (1995); Fifield P., Marketing Strategy, (1992); Hax A.C., Majluf N.S., The use of the growth-share matrix in strategic planning, Interfaces, 13, 1, pp. 46-60, (1983); Hax A.C., Majluf N.S., The use of the industry attractiveness-business strength matrix in strategic planning, Interfaces, 13, 2, pp. 54-71, (1983); Jessup L.M., Kukalis S., Better planning using group support systems, Long Range Planning, 23, 3, pp. 100-105, (1990); Klein M.R., Methlie L.B., Knowledge-Based Decision Support Systems, pp. 395-417, (1995); Levy J.B., Yoon E., Modelling global market entry decision by fuzzy logic with an application to country risk assessment, European Journal of Operational Research, 82, 1, pp. 53-78, (1995); Li S., Computer-based support for developing marketing strategy, (1998); Li S., The development of a hybrid intelligent system for developing marketing strategy, Decision Support Systems (The International Journal), (1998); Li S., PhD research report – Part III: the development and evaluation of MarStra – a hybrid intelligent system for developing marketing strategy, (1999); Li S., Duan Y., Kinman R., Edwards J.S., A framework for a hybrid intelligent system in support of marketing strategy development, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 17, 2, pp. 70-77, (1999); Li S., Kinman R., Duan Y., Edwards J., Computer-based support for marketing strategy development, European Journal of Marketing, 34, (1999); McDonald M.H.B., Marketing planning and expert systems: an epistemology of practice, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 7, 7-8, pp. 16-23, (1989); McDonald M., Some methodological comments on the directional policy matrix, Journal of Marketing Management, 6, 1, pp. 59-68, (1990); McDonald M., Strategic Marketing Planning, (1996); McDonald M.H.B., Wilson H.N., State-of-the-art development in expert systems and strategic marketing planning, British Journal of Management, 1, 3, pp. 159-170, (1990); McIvor R., Scullion G., McTear M., Development of a strategic management interactive learning expert system, International Journal of Information Resource Management, 3, 2, pp. 11-23, (1992); Morris M.H., Pitt L.F., The contemporary use of strategy, strategic planning, and planning tools by markers: a cross-national comparison, European Journal of Marketing, 27, 9, pp. 36-57, (1993); Moutinho L., Curry B., Davies F., The COMSTRAT model: development of an expert system in strategic marketing, Journal of General Management, 19, 1, pp. 32-47, (1993); EXSYS Professional, Expert System Development Software, (1997); O'Keefe R.M., Balci O., Smith E.P., Validating expert system performance, IEEE Expert, 2, 4, pp. 81-90, (1987); O'Leary T.J., Goul M., Moffitt K.E., Radwan A.E., Validating expert systems, IEEE Expert, 5, 3, pp. 51-58, (1990); Poh H.L., A neural network approach for decision support, International Journal of Applied Expert Systems, 2, 3, pp. 196-216, (1994); Porter M.E., Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analysing Industries and Competitors, (1980); Porter M.E., Industry structure and competitive strategy: keys to profitability, Financial Analysis Journal, July/August, pp. 30-41, (1980); Porter M.E., Corporate strategy: the state of strategic thinking, The Economist, pp. 21-22, (1987); Wilson H., McDonald M., Critical problems in marketing planning: the potential of decision support systems, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 2, pp. 249-269, (1994)","","","","","","","","","02634503","","","","English","Mark.

This is especially relevant in decision-making — the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options —, that is commonly based on personal opinions which may evolve along time. In this work, we present a model of opinion dynamics where opinions are represented using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples, a realistic representation of imprecise information. In our framework, the propagation of opinions in the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes. Additionally, we use a social network to represent agents’ interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). Our opinion dynamics model can be easily integrated into an agent-based system to how opinions spread and evolve. Experimental results show the impact of the communication processes, the social network topology, the awareness deactivation mechanism, and the agents’ influence on the opinion dynamics of others. Furthermore, we present two case studies of our opinion dynamics model applied to marketing and politics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples; Opinion dynamics; Social networks","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Dynamics; Fuzzy logic; Linguistics; Simulation platform; 2-Tuple; 2-tuples; Agent-based model; Deactivation mechanism; Decisions makings; Dynamics models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuple; Fuzzy linguistics; Opinion dynamics; Social network; Computational methods","","","","","AIMAR, (A-TIC-284-UGR18); Andalusian Government, Spain; SIMARK, (P18-TP-4475, RYC-2016-19800); Spanish National Agency of Research; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Universidad de Granada, UGR; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (PGC2018-101216-B-I00); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities , the Andalusian Government, Spain , the University of Granada, Spain , the Spanish National Agency of Research (AEI), and European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) under grants EXASOCO ( PGC2018-101216-B-I00 ), AIMAR ( A-TIC-284-UGR18 ), and SIMARK ( P18-TP-4475 ).

For this reason, companies must have knowledge of the actual standing of their products on the Web. A warning system for online market research is being proposed which allows the identification of critical situations in online opinion formation. When critical situations are detected, warnings are subsequently sent to marketing managers and thus allowing marketers the ability to initiate preventive measures. The warning system operates on a knowledge base which contains product-related success values, online opinions and patterns of social interactions. This knowledge is acquired using methods coming from information extraction, text mining and social network analysis. Based on this knowledge the warning system judges situations accordingly. For this purpose, a neuro-fuzzy approach is chosen which learns linguistic rules from data. These rules are employed to estimate future situations.

How to choose social media influencers is an unanswered question in the literature, and this study attempts to fill this gap. The study employs a Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model (DEMATEL), to determine the relevance of criteria constructed. It observed SMIs on Instagram and reviewed insights from the literature. Five criteria are proposed for selecting the correct influencers: 1) positioning; 2) target; 3) budget; 4) past campaigns; and 5) the number of followers. Businesses were asked to evaluate these criteria according to their experience with using SMIs. The results suggest that the most important criterion is ‘target’, whereas ‘past campaigns’ is the least influential. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

Although there have been some studies in the literature which have used marketing resource dimensions to conduct their research, these studies have not considered the relationships between marketing resource dimensions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the cause and effect factors of marketing resources and to prioritize them in terms of their importance using the fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method. The findings of this study suggest that the dimension managerial capabilities, composed of financial management, effective human resource management and good operations management expertise, exerts a greater influence on marketing strategy than other criteria.

Basically, the decision process is to weight diverse alternatives each having the purpose to attain some of the desired objectives and to figure out the best solution in the complete challenging goals set. In today's rapidly changing and highly uncertain environment, the strategic decisions have an extremely complex and fuzzy nature. In the meantime, the enterprises have tendency to appreciate the new product development (NPD) activities so as to deal with the innovation in the new economy and to fulfill the customer demands adequately. The aim of this study is then to improve the accuracy of decision-making in NPD under uncertainty. We first identify the decision points in the NPD process and the uncertainty factors affecting those points. Next, we determine the necessary decision models and techniques to help the decision makers to reduce their risks. Finally, we propose an integrated approach based on fuzzy logic to shape the decisions and illustrate with an application in software development. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - First, referring numerous studies, conventional IPA has some erroneous assumptions, the customer satisfaction of attribute performance has the characteristic of three-factor theory and the novel approach which integrates natural logarithmic transformation and partial correlation analysis is feasible for acquiring the implicitly derived importance of attributes. Second, according the fact and nature of fuzziness in human perception, this study applies fuzzy set theory to revise conventional IPA. Finally, the FIPA is proposed and subsequently implemented in a Taiwanese hot spring hotel case study. Findings - The implementation of FIPA shows the determined critical service attributes are almost completely different from those attributes acquired by conventional IPA. Hence, the application of conventional IPA may cause practitioners make incorrect decisions of improvement priorities for service attributes and direct unsuitable quality-based marketing strategies. Originality/value - The proposed FIPA which integrates fuzzy set theory, three-factor theory, partial correlation analysis and natural logarithmic transformation avoids the erroneous assumptions of conventional IPA, considers the nature of fuzziness in human perception and includes the actual importance of service attributes. Therefore, the proposed FIPA can effectively assist business managers in determining critical service attributes to improve service quality or customer satisfaction and to achieve competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer services quality;

This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Genetic fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; KDD; Management support; Unsupervised learning","","","","","","Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia, (TIN2008-06681-CO6-01, TIN2008-06681-CO6-05); Generalitat de Catalunya, (2005SGR-00302); Junta de Andalucía, (P07-TIC-3185)","The authors would like to thank Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia for its support under projects TIN2008-06681-CO6-01 and TIN2008-06681-CO6-05 , Generalitat de Catalunya for its support under grant 2005SGR-00302 , and Junta de Andalucía for its support under project P07-TIC-3185 .

The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical methodology to achieve and enhance organizational agility based on strategic objectives. Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the organization being studied are recognized and classified under the perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC). Critical success factors are then identified by ranking the KPIs according to their importance in achieving organizational strategic objectives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In the second step, three houses of quality (HOQs) are constructed sequentially to identify and rank the main agile attributes, agile enablers, and improvement paths. In addition, in order to translate linguistics judgments of practitioners into numerical values in building HOQs, fuzzy logic is employed. Findings: The capability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a case of a multi-national food company in Iran. Through the application, the company could find the most suitable improvement paths to improve its organizational agility. Research limitations/implications: A limited number of KPIs were chosen due to computational and visual constraints related to HOQs. Another limitation, similar to other agility studies, which facilitate decision making among agility metrics, was that the metrics were more industry-specific and less inclusive. Practical implications: A strong practical advantage for the application of the methodology over directly choosing agility metrics without linking them is that through the methodology, the right metrics were selected that match organization’s core values and marketing objectives. While metrics may ostensibly seem unrelated or inappropriate, they actually contributed to the right areas where there were gaps between the current and desired level of agility. It would otherwise be impossible to choose the right metrics without a structured methodology. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel methodology for achieving organizational agility. By utilizing and linking several tools such as BSC, fuzzy TOPSIS, and quality function deployment (QFD), the proposed approach enables organizations to identify the most appropriate agile attributes, agile enablers, and subsequently agile improvement paths. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agile organization;

Within this approach, the group Delphi method is employed to help groups of managers undertake SWOT analysis. Fuzzy logic is applied to fuzzify the results of SWOT analysis. Expert systems are utilised to formulate marketing strategies based upon the fuzzified strategic inputs. In addition, guidelines are also provided to help users link the hybrid approach with managerial judgement and intuition. The effectiveness of the hybrid approach has been validated with MBA and MA marketing students. It is concluded that the hybrid approach is more effective in terms of decision confidence, group consensus, helping to understand strategic factors, helping strategic thinking, and coupling analysis with judgement, etc. © 2002, MCB UP Limited","Delphi method;

This paper presents modifications for the criteria ranking methods, CRITIC and Distance-correlation CRITIC (D-CRITIC). These modifications involve the normalization procedure to silence criteria attribution by utilizing fuzzy logic and the hamming distance. Also, some adjustment to the weighting technique of the CRITIC method is done to capture linear and nonlinear correlations more precisely. These modifications that are applied to the CRITIC method by considering some reference point (RP), produced our proposed (M-CRITIC-RP) method. An illustrative example to rank performance criteria of display advertisement for a digital marketing campaign is used to demonstrate the method's workability. Comparative analysis with appropriate MCDM methods reveals that the distance correlation values for the weights of the M-CRITIC-RP and comparative methods exhibit higher consistency than those between other criteria ranking methods. Moreover, M-CRITIC-RP has a high average value of Spearman rank statistic, indicating high rank consistency. Regarding accuracy, the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) and the Log Accuracy Ratio (LAR) error metrics show lower values for M-CRITIC-RP in comparison to the corresponding values of other criteria ranking methods. M-CRITIC-RP demonstrates sensitivity with changes in the number of alternatives and also to variations in the RPs. The results of the sensitivity analysis guide the analyst to pay ample attention when selecting the RP. Findings also suggest considering a sufficient sample size for better accuracy and consistency of weights and ranks. Several implications were discussed along with advantages and limitations to be addressed for future work. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Criteria ranking; Criteria weights; CRITIC; Distance correlation; Fuzzy logic; Hamming distance; MCDM; Normalization; Search Ad campaign; Weighting technique","Computer circuits; Decision making; Hamming distance; Marketing; Sensitivity analysis; Criteria ranking; Criteria weights; CRITIC; Distance correlation; Fuzzy-Logic; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Normalisation; Search ad campaign; Weighting techniques; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Diakoulaki D., Mavrotas G., Papayannakis L., Determining objective weights in multiple criteria problems: The critic method, Comput.

This system integrates emotional fashion themes and human perception on personalized body shapes and professional designers' knowledge. The corresponding perceptual data are systematically collected from professional using sensory evaluation techniques. The perceptual data of consumers and designers are formalized mathematically using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The complex relation between human body measurements and basic sensory descriptors, provided by designers, is modeled using fuzzy decision trees. The fuzzy decision trees constitute an empirical model based on learning data measured and evaluated on a set of representative samples. The complex relation between basic sensory descriptors and fashion themes, given by consumers, is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. The combination of the two models can provide more complete information to the fashion recommender system, making it possible to evaluate if a specific body shape is relevant to a desired emotional fashion theme and which garment design scheme can improve the image of the body shape. The proposed system has been validated in a customized design and mass market selection through the evaluations of target consumers and fashion experts using a method frequently used in marketing study. © 2014 IEEE.","Fuzzy cognitive maps; fuzzy decision trees; fuzzy relations composition; human perception-based fashion recommender system; personalized garment design; sensory evaluation on human body shapes and emotional fashion themes","Clothing; Decision Making; Fuzzy Logic; Sensors; Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision trees; Design; Forestry; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Product design; Sensory perception; Trees (mathematics); Fuzzy cognitive map; Fuzzy decision trees; Fuzzy relations; Garment design; Human bodies; Human perception; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Portal to E-Commerce Intelligence: Trends and Data, (2013); Maux F., Le e-commerce: Démarche stratégique et diagnostic, Atelier E-Business-Vente en Ligne, (2006); Lee R.S.T., Liu J.N.K., IJADE web-miner: An intelligent agent framework for Internet shopping, IEEE Trans.

H., Cheltenham, United Kingdom","In this paper, the development of a hybrid intelligent system for developing marketing strategy is described. The hybrid system has been developed to: provide a logical process for strategic analysis; support group assessment of strategic marketing factors; help the coupling of strategic analysis with managerial intuition and judgement; help managers deal with uncertainty and fuzziness; and produce intelligent advice on setting marketing strategy. In this system, the strengths of expert systems, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are combined to support the process of marketing strategy development. Moreover, the advantages of Porter's five forces model and the directional policy matrices (DPM) are also integrated to assist strategic analysis. In the paper, the software architecture of the hybrid system is discussed in details. Particularly, the group assessment support module, the fuzzification of strategic factors, and the fuzzy reasoning for setting marketing strategy are addressed. In addition, the empirical field work on evaluating the hybrid system is also summarized. The empirical evidence indicates that the hybrid intelligent system is helpful and useful in supporting the development of marketing strategy.","","Computer software; Expert systems; Fuzzy sets; Marketing; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Hybrid intelligent systems; Porter's five forces model; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Aiken M., Hawley D., Zhang W., Increasing meeting efficiency with a GDSS, Industrial Management and Data System, 94, 8, pp. 13-16, (1994); Aiken M., Vanjani M., Krosp J., Group decision support systems, Review of Business, 16, 3, pp. 38-42, (1995); Alpar P., Knowledge-based modelling of marketing managers' problem solving behaviour, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 8, pp. 5-16, (1991); Alavi M., Group decision support systems: A key to business team productivity, Journal of Information Systems Management, 8, 3, pp. 36-41, (1991); Amaravadi C., Samaddar S., Dutta S., Intelligent marketing information systems: Computerised intelligence for marketing decision making, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 13, 2, pp. 4-13, (1995); Belardo S., Duchessi P., Coleman J.R., A strategic decision support system at Orell Fussli, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10, 4, pp. 135-157, (1994); Borch O.J., Hartvigsen G., Knowledge-based systems for strategic market planning in small firms, Decision Support Systems, 7, 2, pp. 145-157, (1991); Borenstein D., Towards a practical method to validate decision support systems, Decision Support Systems, 23, pp. 227-239, (1998); Brownlie D., Spender J.C., Managerial judgement in strategic marketing: Some preliminary thoughts, Management Decision, 33, 6, pp. 39-50, (1995); Campbell L., Technology update: Group decision support systems, Journal of Accountancy, 170, 1, pp. 47-50, (1990); Carlsson C., Fuzzy logic and hyperknowledge: A new, effective paradigm for active DSS, Proceedings of HICSS-30, pp. 324-333, (1997); Carlsson C., Expert systems as conceptual frameworks and management support systems for strategic management, International Journal of Information Resources Management, 2, 4, pp. 14-22, (1991); Carlsson C., Kokkonen O., Walden P., Woodstrat: A support system for strategic management, Information Technology for Management Improving Quality and Productivity, pp. 148-154, (1996); Carlsson C., Walden P., Kokkonen O., Effective strategic management with hyperknowledge: The Woodstrat case, The Finnish Paper and Timber Journal, 78, 5, pp. 278-290, (1996); Day G.S., Analysis for Strategic Market Decisions, (1986); Desanctis G., Gallupe R.B., A foundation for the study of group decision support systems, Management Science, 33, 5, pp. 589-609, (1987); Dennis A.R., George J.F., Jessup L.M., Nunamaker J.F.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a multidimensional panel data method that includes several fixed effects. The dependent variable is a multifaceted construct that measures the participants’ intention to vote. The independent variables are electronic word of mouth (eWOM), customisation (CUS), entertainment (ENT), interaction (INT), trendiness (TRD), candidate’s perceived image (CPI), religious beliefs (RB), gender and age. The grouping variables that signify fixed effects are employment status, level of education, mostly used social media and religion. First, the significance of said fixed effects was tested through an ANOVA process. Then, the main model was estimated, including the significant grouping variables as fixed effects. Findings: Employment status and level of education were significant fixed effects. Also, eWOM, ENT, INT, CPI, RB and gender significantly affected participants’ voting intention. Research limitations/implications: Being based on a questionnaire that asked participants about how they perceive different aspects of social media, the present study is limited to their perceptions. Therefore, further studies covering the voters’ behaviour in action could be efficient complements to the present study. Practical implications: The findings could guide the political parties into prioritizing the aspects of social media in forming an effective campaign resulting in being elected. Social implications: The findings have the potential to help the public in making better informed decisions when voting. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate applications for social media which are beyond leisure time fillers. Originality/value: Fuzzy logic and multidimensional panel data estimates are this study’s novelty and originality. Structural equation modelling and crisp linguistic values have been used in previous studies on social media’s effect on voting intent. The former refines the data gathered from a questionnaire, and the latter considers the possibility of including different grouping factors to achieve a more efficient and less biased estimation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Multidimensional panel data; Political marketing; Public choice; Social media marketing; Voting intention","","","","","","","","Abrams D., Travaglino G.A., Grant P.R., Templeton A., Bennett M., Lalot F., Mobilizing IDEAS in the scottish referendum: predicting voting intention and well-being with the identity-deprivation-efficacy-action-subjective well-being model, British Journal of Social Psychology, 59, 2, pp. 425-446, (2020); Abu-Alhaija A., Nerina R., Hashim H., Jaharuddin N.S., Religion in consumer behaviour research: the significance of religious commitment and religious affiliation, (2018); Ajina A.S., The perceived value of social media marketing: an empirical study of online word-of-mouth in Saudi Arabian context, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 6, 3, pp. 1512-1527, (2019); Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Dwivedi Y.K., Algharabat R., Social media in marketing: a review and analysis of the existing literature, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1177-1190, (2017); Aral S., Eckles D., Protecting elections from social media manipulation, Science, 365, 6456, pp. 858-861, (2019); Azazi N.A.N., Shaed M.M., Social media and decision-making process among tourist: a systematic review, Jurnal Komunikasi: Malaysian Journal of Communication, 36, 4, pp. 395-409, (2020); Azhar M., Ali R., Hamid S., Akhtar M.J., Rahman M.N., Demystifying the effect of social media eWOM on revisit intention post-COVID-19: an extension of theory of planned behaviour, Future Business Journal, 8, 1, (2022); Bailey A.A., Bonifield C.M., Arias A., Social media use by young Latin American consumers: an exploration, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 43, pp. 10-19, (2018); Bakos Y., Dellarocas C., Cooperation without enforcement?

Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.","Analytic network process; Enterprise resource planning; Fuzzy logic; Multiple-criteria decision-making; Software selection","Computer software; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent agents; Marketing; Problem solving; Analytic network process; Multiple-criteria decision-making; Software selection; Enterprise resource planning","","","","","","","Agarwal A., Shankar R., On-line trust building in e-enabled supply chain, Supply Chain Manage.
