The difficulty of measuring brand equity has been a problem that has plagued the industry for many years and needs to be solved due to the many models miscellaneous methods difficulties in unification and insensitivity of brand equity measurement. Brand equity measurement can be operated from finance market and consumer perspectives while marketers often measure brand equity from a consumer perspective as they focus on brand communication and sales issues. Traditional approaches for brand equity measurement mainly utilize consumer surveys a major limitation of which is that the respondents are highly susceptible to the influence of research instruments such as survey design and intention of the researchers. Additionally survey respondents may be unable or unwilling to express the actual hidden opinions. Traditional approaches are also limited for low efficiency in data collection which leads to delayed reporting high cost and insensitive results and therefore they may be difficult to provide timely information for marketing decisions. With the diffusion of social media consumers are provided with a greater ability to express their opinions freely on social networks. Clothing consumers in particular appear highly active on social media largely because clothing products can provide a lot of worthy topics for social conversations. In this background social listening which monitors naturally occurring brand-related consumer conversations on social networks provides an alternative data source for brand equity measurement for clothing brands. To address the problems of slow response time high cost and insensitive results of traditional brand equity measurement methods the research proposes and validates a method of measuring apparel brand equity based on social listening data by taking into account the characteristics of apparel brands. The proposed method applied consumer-based brand equity framework to social listening data which was obtained with web crawling technologies. The research first developed a framework of seven dimensions of brand benefits for clothing brands based on Keller's brand equity theory which involves brand benefits association in brand image. The seven dimensions include expertise quality aesthetics entertainment social identity fashionability and individuality. The research utilized Sina Weibo as the source of social listening data and selected brand N a leading international sports wear brand as the case to illustrate the proposed approach. Using a web crawling technology the research obtained a total of 54 360 consumer conversations of this brand on Sina Weibo for the year of 2021 involving 5 032 samples and 49 328 pieces of full data. Next the research used the keyword extraction algorithm of LDA topic model to process and purify the unstructured social listening data to establish a thesaurus for the brand benefit dimensions. The research repetitively performed the LDA algorithm four times using samples of the full data to ensure the thesaurus was complete and 1 600 pieces of data were extracted. The study concluded that the re-emergence of new words had an impact of less than 1. 41% on the brand interest keyword lexicon indicating that the lexicon was largely saturated. The resulting thesaurus included 28 keywords for the expertise dimension 12 for quality 17 for aesthetics 21 for entertainment 24 for social identity 14 for fashionability and 14 for individuality. Lastly the TF-IDF text similarity algorithm was used to calculate the similarity between the thesaurus of each dimension and the full data of social conversations to achieve the measurement of brand equity for the case brand. Innovation in this research are three folds. First the research designed and validated a new approach to measure clothing brand equity which may overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. Second it established a set of indicators of clothing brand equity which can be used for future research. Third it provided a solution to processing unstructured data in natural languages. The results showed that in 2021 consumers were highly concerned of social identity of the case brand its brand equity was influenced by the Xinjiang Cotton event which created tremendous number of conversations about the brand on social networks. In conclusion brand benefits in brand equity which marketers are highly concerned of can be extracted from social listening data. The proposed approach based on social listening data which are often dynamic may overcome the limitations of traditional methods in cost efficiency granularity and measurement sensitivity. In terms of methodology the keyword extraction algorithms such as LDA can be used to construct thesaurus of brand benefit dimensions and text-similarity algorithms can be used to provide quantitative assessment for the dimensions of brand equity. Previous research has shown that carefully planned efforts in enhancing brand equity can significantly improve marketing effectiveness. Emphasizing brand benefits during online shopping festivals or promotional events for instance can create greater consumer engagement with a brand enhance brand image in the minds of consumers and consequently improve consumers' willingness to buy. In future research the algorithms of the proposed approach can be further optimized by applying more cutting-edge machine learning techniques. For instance the algorithm in extraction of keywords and the accuracy of the algorithm for calculating text similarity have room for improvement to achieve more robust measurement of brand equity. © 2022 China Silk Association.

Because classic product-diffusion models such as the Bass model consider only initial product purchases, they are ill-fitted for sales prediction for today’s technology products with a shorter life cycle and frequent repeat purchases or subscription renewals. Despite the long tradition of product diffusion research, there exists no viable model option when repeat purchases constitute a large proportion of product sales. The present study introduces a new sales growth model, termed the generalized diffusion model with repeat purchases (GDMR), to fill this void. The GDMR formulates the growth rate of sales using a noninteger-order integral equation rather than the integer-order differential equation typically adopted in existing diffusion models. The GDMR is parsimonious and easy to implement. Empirical results show that the GDMR fits sales data with varying proportions of repeat purchases quite well, making it suitable for predicting sales of a wide variety of products. In addition, the GDMR can be extended to incorporate marketing mix variables, thus enhancing its applicability in business decision making. Furthermore, using both real and simulated data, we show that the GDMR can reliably recover a product’s adoption trend using only sales data, thus cementing its theoretical validity and empirical effectiveness. Finally, we show that the GDMR is superior to generic time series and machine learning models in predicting future product sales. 2022 INFORMS.","diffusion of innovations; fractional calculus; multiunit ownerships; repeat purchases; replacements","Decision making; Differential equations; Diffusion; Forecasting; Integral equations; Learning systems; Life cycle; Diffusion model; Diffusion of innovations; Fractional calculus; Generalized diffusion; Multiunit ownership; Product sales; Products diffusions; Repeat purchase; Replacement; Technology products; Sales","","","","","","","Baesens B, Viaene S, Van den Poel D, Vanthienen J, Dedene G, Bayesian neural network learning for repeat purchase modeling in direct marketing, Eur.

However, insurance companies need to have a good profile of potential policyholders. Customer profiling has become one of the essential marketing strategies for any sustainable business, such as the insurance market, to identify potential life insurance purchasers. One well-known method of carrying out customer profiling and segmenting is machine learning. Hence, this study aims to provide a helpful framework for predicting potential life insurance policyholders using a data mining approach with different sampling methods and to lead to a transition to sustainable life insurance industry development. Various samplings, such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, Randomly Under-Sampling, and ensemble (bagging and boosting) techniques, are proposed to handle the imbalanced dataset. The result reveals that the decision tree is the best performer according to ROC and, according to balanced accuracy, F1 score, and GM comparison, Naïve Bayes seems to be the best performer. It is also found that ensemble models do not guarantee high performance in this imbalanced dataset. However, the ensembled and sampling method plays a significant role in overcoming the imbalanced problem. © 2023 by the authors.","ensemble; imbalanced data; life insurance; machine learning; sampling","data mining; insurance industry; machine learning; prediction; sampling; sustainability","","","","","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM, (GGPM-2020-016)","This research was funded by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, grant number GGPM-2020-016.","Hiwase V.A., Agrawal A.J., Review on application of data mining in life insurance, Int.

This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model. Finally, a multifaceted analysis suggests that the proposed framework is not only effective as an explainable recommendation model but also provides a powerful tool for planning various marketing strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Model-intrinsic approach","Decision making; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Marketing; Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Knowledge graphs; Model-intrinsic approach; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Chen X., Explainable Recommendation: A Survey and New Perspectives, (2020); Barredo Arrieta A., Diaz-Rodriguez N., Del Ser J., Bennetot A., Tabik S., Barbado A., Garcia S., Gil-Lopez S., Molina D., Benjamins R., Chatila R., Herrera F., Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Inf.

This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial Intelligence; Decision- Making; Delphi Method; Ethics; Machine Learning; Marketing Management","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (2120481); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [ 2120481 ].

An extensive body of marketing literature has scrutinized the influence of customers’ reviews by linking such aspects as the volume and valance of reviews with product sales and customers’ purchase intention. The aim of this study, for which dual coding theory was used, was to understand the relationship between reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the latent Dirichlet allocation technique to categorize customers’ reviews. The present findings contribute to the literature by showing the underlying mechanisms that customers use to interpret reviews and associate them with numerical ratings. Findings: The gradient boosted decision tree model demonstrates that non-abstract-dominant reviews (reviews mainly consist of tangible objects, actions, events or affective words) are significant predictors of their corresponding numerical ratings. However, abstract-dominant reviews (i.e. those consisting primarily of intangible objects, events or actions) cannot predict their associated numerical ratings. Originality/value: The present findings contribute to the literature by showing the underlying mechanisms that customers use to interpret reviews and associate them with numerical ratings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer review; Dual coding theory; Gradient boosted decision tree; LDA; Machine learning; Online customer review; Online text reviews; Topic modeling","","","","","","","","Altarriba J., Bauer L.M., The distinctiveness of emotion concepts: a comparison between emotion, abstract, and concrete words, The American Journal of Psychology, 117, 3, pp. 389-410, (2004); Blei D.M., Surveying a suite of algorithms that offer a solution to managing large document archives, Communications of the ACM, 55, 4, pp. 77-84, (2012); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 1, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Blei D.M., Griffiths T.L., Jordan M.I., The nested Chinese restaurant process and Bayesian nonparametric inference of topic hierarchies, Journal of the ACM, 57, 2, pp. 1-35, (2010); Burges C.J.C., From ranknet to lambdarank to lambdamart: an overview, Learning, 11, pp. 23-581, (2010); Chen L., The impact of the content of online customer reviews on customer satisfaction: evidence from yelp reviews, Conference Companion Publication of the 2019 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 171-174, (2019); Chen R., Xu W., The determinants of online customer ratings: a combined domain ontology and topic text analytics approach, Electronic Commerce Research, 17, 1, pp. 31-50, (2017); Chen Y.C., Shang R.A., Kao C.Y., The effects of information overload on consumers’ subjective state towards buying decision in the internet shopping environment, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 8, 1, pp. 48-58, (2009); Chevalier J.A., Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); Cheung C.M.K., Xiao B.S., Liu I.L., Do actions speak louder than voice?

However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques. The main contribution of this research effort is twofold: the definition of a general-purpose BFF/Sentiment Analysis methodology and the development of a prediction model from online UGC based on the Big Five personality traits in the tourism research scenario. © 2022 Ikenga.

Given the rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing importance of understanding online consumer behavior, our research focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of customer navigation on e-commerce websites and its effects on purchasing decisions. Recognizing the multidimensional and dynamic nature of consumer behavior, we utilize machine learning techniques, which offer the capacity to handle complex data structures and reveal hidden patterns within the data, thereby augmenting our comprehension of underlying consumer behavior mechanisms. By analyzing clickstream data using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we provide new insights into the internal structure of customer clusters and propose a methodology for analyzing non-linear relationships in datasets. Our results reveal that the time spent reading product-related information, combined with other factors such as bounce rates, exit rates, and customer type, significantly influences a customer’s purchasing decision. This study contributes to the existing literature on e-commerce research and offers practical implications for e-commerce website design and marketing strategies. © 2023 by the author.","clickstream data; clustering; e-commerce; Machine Learning; Principal Component Analysis","","","","","","","","Koufaris M., Applying the Technology Acceptance Model and Flow Theory to Online Consumer Behavior, Inf.

The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation. © 2022,Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

Design/methodology/approach: The random survival forest approach is introduced to the real estate market. The most important predictors of time on market are revealed and it is analyzed how the survival probability of residential rental apartments responds to these major characteristics. Findings: Results show that price, living area, construction year, year of listing and the distances to the next hairdresser, bakery and city center have the greatest impact on the marketing time of residential apartments. The time on market for an apartment in Munich is lowest at a price of 750 € per month, an area of 60 m2, built in 1985 and is in a range of 200–400 meters from the important amenities. Practical implications: The findings might be interesting for private and institutional investors to derive real estate investment decisions and implications for portfolio management strategies and ultimately to minimize cash-flow failure. Originality/value: Although machine learning algorithms have been applied frequently on the real estate market for the analysis of prices, its application for examining time on market is completely novel. This is the first paper to apply a machine learning approach to survival analysis on the real estate market. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision tree; Housing; Machine learning; Random forest; Residential; Time on market","","","","","","","","Ahlfeldt G.M., Wendland N., The micro-cosmos of German cities: new insights into the supply of and demand for urban amenities, Understanding German Real Estate Markets, pp. 79-88, (2017); Antipov E.A., Pokryshevskaya E.B., Mass appraisal of residential apartments: an application of random forest for valuation and a CART-based approach for model diagnostics, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 2, pp. 1772-1778, (2012); Benefield J.D., Hardin W.G., Does time-on-market measurement matter?, The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 50, 1, pp. 52-73, (2015); Borst R.A., Artificial neural networks in mass appraisal, Journal of Property Tax Assessment and Administration, 1, 2, pp. 5-15, (1995); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Cajias M., Freudenreich P., Exploring the determinants of liquidity with big data–market heterogeneity in German markets, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 36, 1, pp. 3-18, (2018); Cajias M., Freudenreich P., Freudenreich A., Exploring the determinants of real estate liquidity from an alternative perspective: censored quantile regression in real estate research, Journal of Business Economics, 90, 7, pp. 1057-1086, (2020); Ceh M., Kilibarda M., Lisec A., Bajat B., Estimating the performance of random forest versus multiple regression for predicting prices of the apartments, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 7, 5, (2018); Cetin S., Ulgen A., Dede I., Li W., On fair performance comparison between Random Survival Forest and Cox regression: an example of colorectal cancer study, SciMedicine Journal, 3, 5, pp. 66-76, (2021); Cirman A., Pahor M., Verbic M., Determinants of time on the market in a thin real estate market, Engineering Economics, 26, 1, pp. 4-11, (2015); Cox D.R., Regression models and life-tables, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological), 34, 2, pp. 187-220, (1972); Dimopoulos T., Tyralis H., Bakas N.P., Hadjimitsis D., Accuracy measurement of random forests and linear regression for mass appraisal models that estimate the prices of residential apartments in Nicosia, Cyprus, Advances in Geosciences, 45, pp. 377-382, (2018); Do A.Q., Grudnitski G.A., A neural network approach to residential property appraisal, The Real Estate Appraiser, 58, 3, pp. 38-45, (1992); Fan G.Z., Ong S.E., Koh H.C., Determinants of house price: a decision tree approach, Urban Studies, 43, 12, pp. 2301-2315, (2006); Gabrielli L., Ruggeri A.G., Scarpa M., Location, location, location': fluctuations in real estate market values after COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine based on econometric and spatial analysis, random forest, and multivariate regression, Land, 12, 6, (2023); Gao G., Bao Z., Cao J., Qin A.K., Sellis T., Location-centered house price prediction: a multi-task learning approach, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 13, 2, pp. 1-25, (2022); Grobel S., Analysis of spatial variance clustering in the hedonic modeling of housing prices, Journal of Property Research, 36, 1, pp. 1-26, (2019); Harrell F., Califf R., Pryor D., Lee K., Rosati R., Evaluating the yield of medical tests, Journal of the American Medical Association, 247, 18, pp. 2543-2546, (1982); Hoeberichts M., van Rooij M., Siegmann A., House list prices and durations in boom and bust, (2013); Ishwaran H., Kogalur U.B., Blackstone E.H., Lauer M.S., Random survival forests, The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2, 3, pp. 841-860, (2008); Jaen R.D., Data mining: an empirical application in real estate valuation, Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, 2002, pp. 314-317, (2002); Kluger B.D., Miller N.G., Measuring residential real estate liquidity, Real Estate Economics, 18, 2, pp. 145-159, (1990); Kok N., Koponen E.L., Martinez-Barbosa C.A., Big data in real estate?

Whereas, the sheer volume of online reviews makes it hard for consumers, especially the older adults who perceive more difficulties in reading reviews and obtaining information compared to younger adults, to locate the useful ones. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective method to locate valuable reviews of mobile phones for older adults. Besides, the authors also want to explore what characteristics of the technology older adults prefer. This will benefit both e-retailers and e-commerce platforms. Design/methodology/approach: After collecting online reviews related to mobile phones designed for older adults from a popular Chinese e-commerce platform (JD Mall), topic modeling, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) methods were applied to extract latent topics and uncover potential dimensions that consumers frequently referred to in their reviews. According to consumers' attitudes towards different popular topics, seven machine learning models were employed to predict the usefulness and popularity of online reviews due to their excellent performance in prediction. To improve the performance, a weighted model based on the two best-performing models was built and evaluated. Findings: Based on the TF-IDF, topic modeling, and LIWC methods, the authors find that older adults are more interested in the exterior, sound, and communication functions of mobile phones. Besides, the weighted model (Random Forest: Decision Tree = 2:1) is the best model for predicting the online review popularity, while random forest performs best in predicting the perceived usefulness of online reviews. Practical implications: This study’s findings can help e-commerce platforms and merchants identify the needs of the targeted consumers, predict reviews that will get more attention, and provide some early responses to some questions. Originality/value: The results propose that older adults pay more attention to the mobile phones' exterior, sound, and communication function, guiding future research. Besides, this paper also enriches the current studies related to making predictions based on the information contained in the online reviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-marketing; Information management;

This article proposes customer churn prediction models for a SaaS inventory management company in Thailand. The main focus of this work is seeking the most suitable customer churn prediction model for this case-study SaaS inventory management company which is currently having a high churn rate issue. This paper explores four machine learning algorithms, which are logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree (DT) and random forest. The results show that the optimised DT model is capable of outperforming other classification models toward recall scorer with validated testing scores of 94.4% of recall and 88.2% of F1-score. Moreover, feature importance scores are investigated for practical insights to identify features that are significantly related to churn behaviour. Therefore, the findings can help the case-study company indicate customers who are going to churn more precisely and enhance the effectiveness of managerial decisions and effective marketing movement.

We presented a framework using the distance-based algorithm, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine to capture customers’ preferences toward promotion channels. Additionally, online learning programming was combined with machine learning strategies to fit a dynamic environment, evaluating its performance through a parsimonious model of minimum regret. A resource optimization model was proposed using classification results as input. In particular, we collected data from an institution that provides financial credit products to capital-constrained small businesses. Our sample contained 525,919 customers who will be introduced to a new product. By simulating different scenarios between resources and demand, we showed an up to 22.42% increase in the number of expected borrowers when KNN was performed with an optimal resource allocation strategy. Our results also show that KNN is the most stable method to perform classification and that the distance-based algorithm has the most efficient adoption with online learning. © 2022 by the authors.

Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account.

The sample is composed of 46 students from the Bachelor of Administration, Commerce and Marketing program at La Salle University. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that sending messages, watching instructional videos, and publishing exercises on Facebook supports the teaching-learning process in financial mathematics. Likewise, data science identified six predictive models for the use of Facebook in the educational context by means of the decision tree technique. Analysis using neural networks identified the influence of sending messages, watching instructional videos, and publishing exercises on Facebook during the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills. Finally, Facebook is a technological and communication tool that transforms the organization of teaching and learning activities in financial mathematics education.

Sellers and ecommerce firms use social media to increase user engagement, visibility, and sales. Seller ratings are as important as the product ratings on ecommerce platforms to drive buying decisions. Based on sellers’ actions on social media, this study examines seller turnover and disengagement on e-commerce platforms. The study has been supported by the justice theory. Seller reviews and ratings from e-commerce platforms and conversations from social media platforms have been gathered. Using natural language processing, machine learning, partial least squares (PLS) path analysis, and statistical inferences, objectives of the study are met. The study offers recommendations for both practitioners and researchers. The sellers must focus more on interaction and communication than marketing. Through a longitudinal analysis, the study also establishes that ecommerce organizations can use seller social media performance as a predictor of future seller churn and disengagement so they can take the necessary remedial action. © 2023 IGI Global.

We evaluate several machine learning methods (latent Dirichlet allocation, correlated topic model, structural topic model, replicated softmax model) with respect to their ability to reproduce the browsing behavior of households across websites. In addition, we compare these machine learning methods to a related classical technique, singular value decomposition. In our study, the replicated softmax model outperforms latent Dirichlet allocation, but the correlated topic model attains the overall best performance. Compared to singular value decomposition both the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model lead to a more efficient compression of web browsing data. On the other hand, singular value decomposition surpasses latent Dirichlet allocation. We interpret results of the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model by determining combinations of topics or hidden variables that are heterogeneous with respect to visited websites. We show that decision makers should not rely on bivariate measures of site visits, as these do not agree with measures of interdependences between sites that can be inferred from the correlated topic model or the replicated softmax model. We investigate how well topics or hidden variables measured by these methods predict yearly household expenditures. The correlated topic model leads to the best predictive performance, followed by the replicated softmax model. We also discuss how the replicated softmax model can be used to support online marketing decisions of websites. © 2021, The Author(s).","Machine learning; Online marketing; Restricted Boltzmann machine; Topic models; Web browsing","","","","","","Universität Regensburg, UR","","Bindra C., Building a Privacy-First Future for Web Advertising, (2021); Blei D.M., Probabilistic topic models, Commun ACM, 55, 4, pp. 17-35, (2012); Blei D.M., Lafferty J.D., A correlated topic model of science, Ann Appl Stat, 1, 1, pp. 17-35, (2007); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation, J Mach Learn Res, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bradlow E.T., Gangwar M., Kopalle P., The role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing, J Retail, 93, pp. 79-95, (2017); Buschken J., Allenby G.M., Sentence-based text analysis for customer reviews, Mark Sci, 35, pp. 953-975, (2016); Chintagunta P., Hanssens D.M., Hauser J.R., Marketing science and big data, Mark Sci, 35, pp. 341-342, (2016); Coccaro N., Jurafsky D., Towards better integration of semantic predictors in statistical language modeling, Proceedings of the 5Th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, pp. 2403-2406, (1998); Crain S.P., Zhou K., Yang S.-H., Zha H., Dimensionality reduction and topic modeling.

Lead scoring is an effective and efficient way of measuring the quality of leads. In addition, as a critical Information Technology tool, a proper lead scoring model acts as an alleviator to weaken the conflicts between sales and marketing functions. Yet, little is known regarding lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. Lead scoring models are commonly categorized into two classes: traditional and predictive. While the former primarily relies on the experience and knowledge of salespeople and marketers, the latter utilizes data mining models and machine learning algorithms to support the scoring process. This study aims to review and analyze the existing literature on lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine lead scoring models. A total of 44 studies have met the criteria and were included for analysis. Fourteen metrics were identified to measure the impact of lead scoring models on sales performance. With the increased use of data mining and machine learning techniques in the fourth industrial revolution, predictive lead scoring models are expected to replace traditional lead scoring models as they positively impact sales performance. Despite the relative cost of implementing and maintaining predictive lead scoring models, it is still beneficial to supersede traditional lead scoring models, given the higher effectiveness and efficiency of predictive lead scoring models. This study reveals that classification is the most popular data mining model, while decision tree and logistic regression are the most applied algorithms among all the predictive lead scoring models. This study contributes by systematizing and recommending which machine learning method (i.e., supervised and/or unsupervised) shall be used to build predictive lead scoring models based on the integrity of different types of data sources. Additionally, this study offers both theoretical and practical research directions in the lead scoring field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Data mining model;

This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques. Both theoretical and practical implications are provided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","E-commerce; Priming theory; Session-based recommendation; Text mining","Commerce; Data mining; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Product design; Across time; Key elements; Learning models; Learning techniques; Multiple user; Priming theory; Product information; Session-based recommendation; Text-mining; User sessions; Taps","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST 108-2410-H-027-020, MOST 109-2218-E-002-016, MOST 109-2410-H-027 -009 -MY2)","The authors are very grateful to the anonymous referees and Editor for their helpful comments and valuable suggestions for improving the earlier version of the paper.

It highlights the importance of strategically designing image content for business marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study designed a computation extensive research model based upon the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory using 39,139 Facebook posts of 125 organizations selected from Fortune 500 firms. Attributes from images and text were estimated using deep learning models. Subsequently, inferential analysis was established with ordinary least squares regression. Further machine learning algorithms, like support vector regression, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree and random forest, are used to analyze the significance and robustness of the proposed model for predicting engagement metrics. Findings: The results indicate that the social media (SM) image content of B2B firms significantly impacts their social media engagement. The visual and linguistic attributes are extracted from the image using deep learning. The distinctive effect of each feature on social media engagement (SME) is empirically verified in this study.

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) – path analysis. Findings: According to the study’s findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: This current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implications: The outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implications: The application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/value: The study’s findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP). In terms of contribution, this study adds to the body of knowledge already available on marketing modification and business performance, particularly in the setting of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Food processing SMEs; Ghana; Marketing modification","","","","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi K., The impact of innovative marketing on the performance of Ghanaian food processing small and medium enterprises (SMEs), (2020); Abueid R., Rehman S.U., Nguyen N.T., The impact of balanced scorecard in estimating the performance of Banks in Palestine, EuroMed Journal of Business, 18, 1, pp. 1450-2194, (2022); Acikdilli G., Mintu-Wimsatt A., Kara A., Spillan J.E., Export market orientation, marketing capabilities and export performance of SMEs in an emerging market: a resource-based approach, Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 30, 4, pp. 526-541, (2022); Adam N.A., Alarifi G., Innovation practices for survival of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the covid-19 times: the role of external support, Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 10, 1, pp. 1-22, (2021); Afriyie S., Du J., Apiah K., The role of marketing capabilities as a resource-based view on organizational performance, American Scientific Research Journal for Engineering, Technology, and Sciences (ASRJETS), 41, 1, pp. 109-123, (2018); Akinseye E.M., Onimole S.O., Ekundayo O.A., Adebusoye A.B., Impact of marketing strategies on organizational growth: a study of selected industries in Lagos state Nigeria, International Journal of Business and Economics Research, 11, 1, pp. 1-7, (2022); Akuffo I.N., Cross-functional teams and innovation performance: the case of multinational enterprises, International Journal of Export Marketing, 3, 3, pp. 204-218, (2020); Alshanty A.M., Emeagwali O.L., Market-sensing capability, knowledge creation and innovation: the moderating role of entrepreneurial-orientation, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 4, 3, pp. 171-178, (2019); Amer F., Hammoud S., Khatatbeh H., Lohner S., Boncz I., Endrei D., The deployment of balanced scorecard in health care organizations: is it beneficial?

The present study discusses the central and peripheral sources of influence, such as the content of the review, star rating, review length, and the total number of votes on the perceived usefulness of the review. It analyses reviews from Amazon.com on three products, namely, a videogame, digital music, and a grocery item. Using text mining, the study uncovers sentiment polarity, identifies sentiment patterns, and finally, analyses the perceived usefulness of reviews under the moderation effect. The study establishes that the impact of the central route is not significant for search goods. The study concludes that peripheral sources have a significant impact on the search products. Our study provides insights on how marketing strategies can be formulated by online retailers based on the product type. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Electronic word of mouth; Online customer review; Peripheral;

However, because of the growing concern over user privacy, effectively and accurately delivering advertising to promote repurchasing has become more difficult. Here, we propose an effective framework based on machine learning to model the air traveler repurchasing and furthermore employ a field experiment to test the utility of a model framework. Specifically, we collected that this model framework is based on the random forest algorithm and compared with the conclusions of the other four algorithms, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and ExtraTree algorithms. The results show that the proposed model framework is better than the prediction results of the other algorithms. In addition, the proposed model framework was verified through a real case of an airline in China. This study will serve as a guide to analyze the repurchase behaviors of an air traveler and help airlines build a loyal air traveler base. © 2022 Zhenyuan Zhang et al.","","Air transportation; Marketing;

However, it raises serious privacy concerns since the learning process may reveal sensitive information in the profiles. It is highly desirable to provide high-quality advertisement recommendations while respecting an individual's privacy. To address the privacy issues, we propose a practical privacy-preserving system that predicts advertisement Click Through Rate (CTR) accurately without revealing any sensitive information of individuals. Our system combines both offline and online training to achieve the goal. In the offline training phase, we develop two differentially private algorithms built upon Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) algorithms, respectively, to transform features and train a privacy-preserving offline model. In the online training phase, we propose a privacy-preserving online learning algorithm to compensate for the decline of offline performance when online feature changes occur. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our system based on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can protect user privacy without compromising the accuracy of CTR prediction, with reasonable computation overhead. © 2021","Data perturbation; Differential privacy;

Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801217, 71872080, 72022007); Tsinghua University, THU, (2019THZWJC12)","The authors appreciate the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments.

This issue is of increasing interest in various fields related to forensic medicine, security, marketing, education, etc. The main objective of author profiling is to identify the type of writer of the messages, whether it is a human or a bot with a very strong presence. These bots have the task of drawing the attention of browsers to specific events, often used to disseminate incorrect and/or false information. In this work, we offer a new approach to detect these bots and the kind of anonymous perpetrators on these social networks. Our approach, purely statistical, is based on digital features (APSF), extracted from users’ tweets, and on the technique of random forests. A total of 17 stylometry-based features were used to train the model. To assess the performance of our approach, we considered different standard measures, namely accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The results obtained show that our approach gives the best performance for both English and Spanish languages. For the English dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 92.45% for the bot detection task and 90.36% for the gender classification; similarly, we obtained accuracy values of 89.68% and 88.88% for the Spanish dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Bot detection; Features extraction; Gender detection; Machine learning; Twitter","Botnet; Decision trees; Bot detections; Critical issues; Digital features; Forensic medicine; Gender classification; Online platforms; Spanish language; Statistical features; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Akar O., Gungor O., Classification of multispectral images using random forest algorithm, J Geod Geoinf, 1, 2, pp. 105-112, (2012); Alarifi A., Alsaleh M., Al-Salman A., Twitter turing test: identifying social machines, Inf Sci, 372, pp. 332-346, (2016); Ashraf S., Javed O., Adeel M., Iqbal H., Nawab R.M.A., Bots and Gender Prediction Using Language Independent Stylometry-Based Approach, (2019); Basil M., Gaikwad S., Salim A.S., Deep learning approach based dominant age group based classification for social network, International Conference on Applied Computing to Support Industry: Innovation and Technology, pp. 148-156, (2019); Bessi A., Ferrara E., Social bots distort the 2016 us presidential election online discussion, First Monday, 21, pp. 7-11, (2016); Boukhari K., Omri M.N., Approximate matching-based unsupervised document indexing approach: application to biomedical domain, Scientometrics, 124, pp. 903-924, (2020); Breiman L., Random forests, Mach Learn, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Cai C., Li L., Zengi D., Behavior enhanced deep bot detection in social media, 2017 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI).

Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Online reviews; Review synthesis; Wine reviews","","","","","","2020 Northeast; Machine Learning, and Business Analytics","We thank the Editor, Area Editor, and two anonymous IJRM reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Models for predicting technology acceptance in older adults are sparse, based on broad questions related to general technology acceptance, and largely not grounded in theories of aging. Objective: This study aimed to use a mixed methods approach involving 5 technologies to comprehensively assess the causal relationships among factors that influence older adults’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Methods: In total, 187 men and women aged 65 to 92 years participated in the study. Participants were given presentations on 5 different technologies spanning domains that included transportation, leisure, health, and new learning and provided ratings of each technology on various measures hypothesized to influence adoption. They were also administered other instruments to collect data on their actual and self-assessed cognitive abilities, rates of discounting of the technologies with respect to willingness to invest time to attain higher skills in the technologies, general technology experience, and attitudes toward technology. We used the machine learning technique of k-fold cross-validated regressions to select variables that predicted participants’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Results: Willingness to adopt technologies was most impacted by 3 variables: perceived value of the technologies (β=.54), perceived improvement in quality of life attainable from the technologies (β=.24), and confidence in being able to use the technologies (β=.15). These variables, in turn, were mostly facilitated or inhibited by the perceived effort required to learn to use the technologies, a positive attitude toward technology as reflected in the optimism component of the technology readiness scale, the degree to which technologies were discounted, and the perceived help needed to learn to use the technologies. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that participants’ willingness to adopt technologies is mainly determined by perceptions of 3 aspects of the technologies; these aspects possibly mediate many relationships with willingness to adopt. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design and marketing of technology products for older consumers. ©Jerad Moxley, Joseph Sharit, Sara J Czaja.","adopt; adoption; aging; application; cognition; cognitive; consumer; design; design; health; independence; learning; leisure; marketing; mobile phone; older adult; relationship; technology; technology; transportation; willingness","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (3 PO1 AG17211)","This study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and National Institutes of Health (NIA 3 PO1 AG17211, Project CREATE IV—Center for Research and Education on Aging and Technology Enhancement).

However, creators producing content about disadvantaged populations have reported that these kinds of systems are biased, having associated their content with prohibited or unsafe content, leading to what creators believed were error-prone decisions to demonetize their videos. Motivated by these reports, we present the results of 20 interviews with YouTube creators and a content analysis of videos, tweets, and news about demonetization cases to understand YouTubers' perceptions of demonetization affecting videos featuring disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, as well as creator responses to demonetization, and what kinds of tools and infrastructure support they desired. We found creators had concerns about YouTube's algorithmic system stereotyping content featuring vulnerable demographics in harmful ways, for example by labeling it ""unsafe'' for children or families - creators believed these demonetization errors led to a range of economic, social, and personal harms. To provide more context to these findings, we analyzed and report on the technique a few creators used to audit YouTube's algorithms to learn what could cause the demonetization of videos featuring LGBTQ people, culture and/or social issues. In response to the varying beliefs about the causes and harms of demonetization errors, we found our interviewees wanted more reliable information and statistics about demonetization cases and errors, more control over their content and advertising, and better economic security.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","algorithm auditing; algorithmic systems; algorithms; bias; content creators; creative economy; demonetization; discrimination; economic opportunity; fair pay; future of work; LGBTQ; machine learning systems.; marginalized communities; monetization; precarious work; user auditing; YouTube","Errors; Learning systems; Machine learning; Statistics; Algorithm auditing; Algorithmic system; Algorithmics; Bias; Content creators; Creative economy; Creatives; Demonetization; Discrimination; Economic opportunities; Fair pay; Future of works; LGBTQ; Machine learning system.; Machine learning systems; Marginalized community; Monetization; Precarious work; User auditing; YouTube; Marketing","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (2040942)","Our study was funded by the National Science Foundation (award number: 2040942), Cisco, and Amazon.","Ajunwa I., Age discrimination by platforms, Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, 40, (2019); Albergotti R., Black Creators Sue YouTube, Alleging Racial Discrimination: Algorithm Removes Their Content or Limits How Much It Can Earn from Advertising, They Allege, (2020); Alexander J., YouTube Fights Back Against Bias Lawsuit from LGBTQ Creators: A California Judge Will Now Determine if the Case Moves Forward, (2020); Ali M., Sapiezynski P., Bogen M., Korolova A., Mislove A., Rieke A., Discrimination Through Optimization: How Facebook?s Ad Delivery Can Lead to Skewed Outcomes, (2019); Smedegaard Andersen J., Zukunft O., Maalej W., Rem: Efficient semi-Automated real-Time moderation of online forums, Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations, (2021); Asplund J., Eslami M., Sundaram H., Sandvig C., Karahalios K., 2020 auditing race and gender discrimination in online housing markets, Proceedings of the Fourteenth International AAAI Conference on the Web and Social Media (ICSWSM, (2020); Austin R., A nation of thieves securing black people?s right to shop and to sell in white america, University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, 16, (1994); Authurs J., Drakopoulou S., Gandini A., 2017 researching youtube, Convergence the International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 24, 1, pp. 3-15, (2017); Barocas S., Hardt M., Narayanan A., Fairness and Machine Learning.

Machine learning techniques, known for their flexibility with non-stationary, non-normal, and non-linear data, were showcased in the empirical illustration, highlighting their effectiveness. The trends of arrivals and prices were found to be significantly positive (p<0.01) for tomato and capsicum. Time delay neural network (TDNN) and hybrid models outperformed the seasonal ARIMA models based on lower RMSE and MAPE for the modelling and forecasting. Utilizing the best-fit models, the prices of tomato and capsicum were forecasted to be highest during June 2024 with ₹2267 and 2623 per q. This study contributed to the growing body of applications of machine learning in agricultural systems. It will help develop a robust market intelligence mechanism to address uncertainties in agricultural markets. © 2024 The Society of Economics and Development, except certain content provided by third parties.","Market intelligence; neural networks; policy decisions; price forecasts","","","","","","","","Abbasi R., Martinez P., Ahmad R., The digitization of agricultural industry: Asystematic literature review on agriculture 4.0, Smart Agricultural Technology, 2, (2022); Amiri A., Bakhshoodeh M., Najafi B., Amiri A., Bakhshoodeh M., Najafi B., Forecasting seasonality in prices of potatoes and onions: Challenge between geostatistical models, neuro-fuzzy approach and winter method, (2011); Box G.E.P., Jenkins G.M., Time series analysis: Forecasting and control (Revised ed.), (1976); Brock W.A., Scheinkman J.A., Dechert W.D., LeBaron B., A test for independence based on the correlation dimension, Econometric Reviews, 15, 3, pp. 197-235, (1996); Darekar A., Reddy A.A., Price forecasting of maize in major states, Maize Journal, 6, pp. 1-5, (2017); Gajanana T.M., Shree K.L.S., Sharada P.S., Kumar S., Analysis of tomato prices in production and consumption markets in India: Policy imperatives, Indian Journal of Agricultural Marketing, 36, 1, pp. 110-131, (2022); Gupta A.K., Forecasting of arrivals and prices of pulses in Chhattisgarh: A statistical approach, (2018); Gupta A.K., Patra C., Singh A.K., Forecasting market prices of soybean in the Ujjain market (Madhya Pradesh), Green Farming, 10, 6, pp. 752-755, (2019); Gupta A.K., Rao V.S., Singh A.K., Forecasting of arrivals and prices of chickpea in Chhattisgarh, International Journal of Agriculture and Statistical Science, 14, 1, pp. 421-426, (2018); Gupta A.K., Sarkar K.A., Bhattacharya D., Dhakre D.S., Potato yield modelling based on meteorological factors using discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks, International Journal of Vegetable Science, 28, 5, pp. 465-476, (2022); Gupta A.K., Sarkar K., Dhakre D.S., Bhattacharya D., Weather-based crop yield prediction using artificial neural networks: A comparative study with other approaches, MAUSAM, 74, 3, pp. 825-832, (2023); Jaiswal R., Jha G.K., Kumar R.R., Choudhary K., Deep long short-term memory-based model for agricultural price forecasting, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 6, pp. 4661-4676, (2022); Jha G.K., Sinha K., Agricultural price forecasting using neural network model: An innovative information delivery system, Agricultural Economics Research Review, 26, 2, pp. 229-239, (2013); Khan Md.

Design/methodology/approach: Earning, spending, saving and borrowing data collected between May 2021 and February 2022 from 17,819 consumers living in the United States were used to examine the factors associated with distrust of banks. Using a conceptual framework borrowed from the health services profession, the study was conducted in two stages. At the first stage, distrust among the unbanked and banked was estimated using a Boruta-random forest algorithm. At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis. Findings: Results from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked. Research limitations/implications: This study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field. Originality/value: The paper provides a discussion about ways domains of trust and specific variables can be utilized to address the persistent problem of financial exclusion in the United States.

For all the stakeholders in the area, this is a real breakthrough, and machine learning is at the core of this revolution. It has profoundly revolutionized companies in many aspects including the evolution of communication methods, the automation of many processes, the growing importance of information systems, etc. With shrinking margins and more demanding customers, supply chain management in increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage. Its management and optimization requires a factual to Supply Chain decision making at strategique, tactical and operational levels. In this context and data rich environment, machine learning approaches and techniques find numerous useful applications for supply chain decision making. Today, companies have no choice but to apply Machine Learning solutions in almost every part of their processes. This fact seems even clearer in markets where competition is fierce. While Machine Learning does not redefine the enterprise, it is certainly a powerful asset for both marketing and process optimization purposes. It is so ingrained in the strategies of companies that now most of them rely heavily on it for all processes from creation, to product quality control, to public relations. In recent years, a series of practical applications of machine learning (ML) for supply chain decisions have been introduced. By interconnecting the ML methods applied for SC decision making, this paper identifies current SC applications and indicates potential research gaps. In this paper, we examine the general usability of machine learning techniques to assist with supply chain decisions. The main objective of this research is therefore to study how machine learning techniques can be integrated into the range of tools available to supply chain decision makers in order to take advantage of the increasing volume of data generated in the supply chain. © 2022 Authors.

New levels of disruption are being introduced using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques of research. In the realm of physical and tangible aspects of service, since this sector have vast amounts of data available application of these techniques are being tested to explore various aspect of the customer experience. Data analysis algorithms like machine learning have been used by firms across the world to analyze these data and understand various facets of customer experience. However, these algorithms suffer from blackbox issues where businesses do not know how the outcome was achieved and if the analysis is biased in some way. In this study, we utilize an explainable machine learning approach on Airbnb data to understand solve two challenges associated with large-scale marketing data. First, we identify and prioritize the customer experience factors like bedrooms, host status, host response rate etc. that have an impact on product pricing. Secondly, we build and test an explainable predictive model on the same. Our research has significant implications for academia and industry in identifying applications of explainable algorithms in decision-making. © 2021 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Customer experience; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Tourism","","","","","","","","Azam N., Yao J., Comparison of term frequency and document frequency based feature selection metrics in text categorization, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 5, pp. 4760-4768, (2012); Babin B.J., Darden W.R., Griffin M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 4, pp. 644-656, (1994); Batista G.E.A.P.A., Monard M.C., An analysis of four missing data treatment methods for supervised learning, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 17, 5-6, pp. 519-533, (2003); Bolton R.N., McColl-Kennedy J.R., Cheung L., Gallan A., Orsingher C., Witell L., Et al., Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, Journal of Service Management, 20, pp. 644-656, (2018); Bose I., Mahapatra R.K., Business data mining—A machine learning perspective, Information & Management, 39, 3, pp. 211-225, (2001); Bueno E.V., Weber T.B.B., Bomfim E.L., Kato H.T., Measuring customer experience in service: A systematic review, The Service Industries Journal, 39, 11-12, pp. 779-798, (2019); Bullock L., (2021); Cambra-Fierro J., Gao L.X., Melero-Polo I., Sese F.J., What drives consumers’ active participation in the online channel?

Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to many large-magnitude relationships between variables that do not signal causal effects. This exposure may carry a substantial cost. Seven studies demonstrate that the magnitudes of relationships between variables can distort consumers' judgments about whether those relationships reflect causal effects. Specifically, consumers often use a magnitude heuristic: consumers infer that relationships with larger perceived magnitudes are more likely to reflect causal effects, even when this is not true (and even when relationships' correlations are held constant). In many situations, relying on the magnitude heuristic will distort causality judgments, such as when large-magnitude relationships between variables are spurious, or when normatively extraneous factors (e.g., reference points) distort perceptions of magnitudes. Moreover, magnitude-distorted (mis)perceptions of causality, in turn, distort consumers' purchase and consumption decisions. Since consumers often encounter spurious relationships with large magnitudes in the health domain and in other consequential domains, the magnitude heuristic is likely to lead to biases in some of consumers' most important decisions.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, it is also necessary to have practical instruments that allow innovations to be reflected in the company. One of those tools is technology. This research aims to analyze innovation and technology in the tequila industry through Bayesian networks with machine learning techniques. Likewise, an innovation and technology management model will be developed to make better decisions, which will allow the company to innovate to generate competitive advantages in a mature low-tech industry. A model is made in which the critical factors that influence management innovation and technology optimally to generate value translate into competitive advantages. The evidence shows that the optimal or non-optimal management of knowledge management and its various factors, through the causality of the variables, allow the interrelation to be more adequately captured to manage it. The results show that the most relevant factors for adequate management of innovation and technology are knowledge management, sales and marketing, organizational and technological architecture, national and international markets, cultivation of raw materials, agave, and management, use of waste, and not research and development. © 2022 by the authors.

Such automated decision-making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision-making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long-term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference-in-differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self-regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision-making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps. © 2023 The Authors.

In this paper, we build upon information overload theory and propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the complexity of the line of argumentation. To test this idea, we implement state-of-the-art machine learning methods that allow us to study the line of argumentation in reviews at the sentence-level. Our empirical analysis based on a dataset of Amazon customer reviews suggests that line of argumentation and review length are closely intertwined such that longer reviews with frequent changes between positive and negative arguments are perceived as less helpful. Our work has important implications for marketing professionals and retailer platforms that can utilize our results to optimize their customer feedback systems, enhance reviewer guidelines, and include more useful product reviews. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Argumentation patterns; Consumer reviews; Data-driven decision-making; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Online word-of-mouth","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., Online review helpfulness: Role of qualitative factors, Psychology & Marketing, 33, 11, pp. 1006-1017, (2016); Allen M., Meta-analysis comparing the persuasiveness of one-sided and two-sided messages, Western Journal Of Speech Communication, 55, 4, pp. 390-404, (1991); am Vermeer S., Araujo T., Bernritter S.F., van Noort G., Seeing the wood for the trees: How machine learning can help firms in identifying relevant electronic word-of-mouth in social media, International Journal Of Research In Marketing, 36, 3, pp. 492-508, (2019); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Deriving the pricing power of product features by mining consumer reviews, Management Science, 57, 8, pp. 1485-1509, (2011); Baek H., Ahn J., Choi Y., Helpfulness of online consumer reviews: Readers’ objectives and review cues, International Journal Of Electronic Commerce, 17, 2, pp. 99-126, (2012); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W.W., Netzer O., Schweidel D.A., Uniting the tribes: Using text for marketing insight, Journal Of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Bettman J.R., Memory factors in consumer choice: A review, Journal Of Marketing, 43, 2, pp. 37-53, (1979); Branco F., Sun M., Villas-Boas J.M., Optimal search for product information, Management Science, 58, 11, pp. 2037-2056, (2012); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Multimodel inference: Understanding AIC and BIC in model selection, Sociological Methods & Research, 33, 2, pp. 261-304, (2004); Cao Q., Duan W., Gan Q., Exploring determinants of voting for the “helpfulness” of online user reviews: A text mining approach, Decision Support Systems, 50, 2, pp. 511-521, (2011); Chen C., Qiu M., Yang Y., Zhou J., Huang J., Li X., Et al., (2019); Chen C.C., Tseng Y.-D., Quality evaluation of product reviews using an information quality framework, Decision Support Systems, 50, 4, pp. 755-768, (2011); Chen Y., Xie J., Online consumer review: Word-of-mouth as a new element of marketing communication mix, Management Science, 54, 3, pp. 477-491, (2008); Chen C., Zhang M., Liu Y., Ma S., (2018); Cheng Y.-H., Ho H.-Y., Social influence's impact on reader perceptions of online reviews, Journal Of Business Research, 68, 4, pp. 883-887, (2015); Cheung C.M.-Y., Sia C.-L., Kuan K.K.Y., Is this review believable?

Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of existing BD literature in sport management outlines new perspectives on BD research method and the application of BD in sport management. Findings: First, through a thorough review of the literature, a domain-specific conceptualization that incorporates the field's mission and priorities was developed. Second, potential data sources and different types of analytical opportunities was identified, highlighting strategies for developing methodological approaches that leads to novel research questions. BD analytics can allow for more flexibility in improving methodological capability to analyze data and, thus, provide more granular and predictive insights. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion of BD's impact on three domains of sport management, whereby the organizations yield data-driven decisions. Originality/value: BD has the potential to transform the sport management operations and bridges the research-practice gap.

However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency. © 2024 The Authors","Aeronautics; Artificial Intelligence; Benefits; Performance; Use cases","Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Predictive analytics; Air France; Artificial intelligence technologies; Benefit; Conceptual maps; Dassault Aviation; Easyjet; Performance; Scientific literature; Sequential approach; Use case; Efficiency","","","","","","","Ahmed R., Shaheen S., Philbin S.P., The role of big data analytics and decision-making in achieving project success, J.

In the dynamic environment of multi-channel customer contact, organizational decision-makers often rely on robust but simplistic forecasting methods. Although forecasting literature indicates that incorporating additional information into time series predictions adds value by improving model performance, extant research in the call center domain barely considers the potential of sophisticated multivariate models. Hence, with an extended dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) approach, this study proposes a new reliable method for call center arrivals’ forecasting that is able to capture the dynamics of a time series and to include contextual information in form of predictor variables. The study evaluates the predictive potential of the approach on the call and e-mail arrival series of a leading German online retailer comprising 174 weeks of data. The analysis involves time series cross-validation with an expanding rolling window over 52 weeks and comprises established time series as well as machine learning models as benchmarks. The multivariate DHR model outperforms the compared models with regard to forecast accuracy for a broad spectrum of lead times. This study further gives contextual insights into the selection and optimal implementation of marketing-relevant predictor variables such as catalog releases, mail as well as postal reminders, or billing cycles. © 2021, The Author(s).","Call center arrivals; Customer relationship management; Dynamic harmonic regression; Forecasting; Machine learning; Time series analysis","","","","","","Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Landesentwicklung und Energie; Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Infrastruktur, Verkehr und Technologie, StMWi; Bayerische Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Landesentwicklung und Energie, StMWi","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding its application in various business disciplines and is expected to be one of the most important technological tools used in marketing in the years to come. The paper addresses the expected role of artificial intelligence solutions in marketing decision-making throughout the five steps of the marketing process. The study provides a systematic review of the research articles addressing the application of AI for marketing decision-making published in the period from 2020 to 2022. Identified applications are then mapped to five steps of the marketing process: analysis, strategy, tactics, customer relations, and value proposition creation. The findings indicate that most of the current AI applications are utilized in the first stage of the marketing process related to understanding and predicting customer behaviour and in the tactical stage of creating a marketing mix. The paper concludes with recommendations for marketing practitioners and recommendations for further research. © 2022 Nikolina Ljepava; published by UIKTEN.","Ai marketing; Decision-making; Machine learning; Marketing process","","","","","","","","Al-Ghamdi L.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is related to contextual mining of texts which helps in identification and extraction of subjective information from the source material. Sentiment analysis is being used for brand monitoring and reputation management across different market segments. It helps to understand how the public perceive a particular brand, product or service that is highly useful for different tech companies, marketing agencies, media organizations, fashion brands etc. In today’s scenario we have been suffering with data overload which makes it impossible to analyze public sentiments without any sort of error or bias. Sentiment analysis provides better insights into the public reviews as it can be automated which ultimately helps in decision making. There are various deep learning and machine learning methods and models as well as natural language processing tools which help in examining and analyzing public opinions with low time complexity. However, deep learning methods have become highly popular in recent times as these models provide high efficiency and accuracy. In this review paper we have provided a complete overview of the common deep learning frameworks being employed for sentiment classification and analysis. This paper discusses various learning models, evaluation, text representations and other metrics in deep learning architectures. The key findings of different authors have been discussed in detail. This paper will help other researchers in understanding the deep learning techniques being used for sentiment analysis. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep learning; Deep Neural networks (DNN); Machine learning; Natural Language Processing; Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN); Sentiment Analysis","","","","","","","","Abdelgwad M.

Channel splits have changed and online conversations have exploded. Marketing budgets have decreased as a percentage of revenue, meaning marketing funds must be used more effectively and efficiently than ever. Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers. This paper shows that with the right ‘business translator’ — that is, a person or team operating as the ‘glue’ between data science and business performance — sophisticated data science becomes accessible to commercial teams looking to drive performance improvements. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Galaz V., Centeno M.

The availability of vaccines does not always mean utilization. This is because, people have less confidence in vaccines, which resulted in vaccination hesitancy and developing global decline in vaccine intake and has caused viral disease outbreaks worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to understand people’s perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine to help the manufacturing companies of the vaccine to improve their marketing strategy based on the rejection causes. In this paper, we used multi-class Sentiment Analysis to classify people’s opinions from extracted tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, using firstly different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and secondly various Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNN-LSTM and RNN-GRU. Then, we investigated the analysis of the negative tweets to identify the causes of rejection using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Finally, we classified these negative tweets according to the rejection causes for all the vaccines using the same selected ML and DL models. The result of SA showed that DT gives the best performance with an accuracy of 92.26% and for DL models, GRU achieved 96.83%. Then, we identified five causes: Lack of safety, Side effect, Production problem, Fake news and Misinformation, and Cost. Furthermore, for the classification of the negative tweets according to the identified rejection causes, the LR achieved the best result with an accuracy of 89.97%. For DL models, the LSTM model showed the best result with an accuracy of 91.66%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19 vaccines; Deep learning; GRU-LSTM; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine rejection causes","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Health risks; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Nearest neighbor search; Sentiment analysis; Statistics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Vaccines; COVID-19 vaccine; Deep learning; Gated recurrent unit-long short term memory; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Learning models; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Opinion analysis; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine rejection cause; COVID-19","","","","","","","Akarsu B., Canbay Ozdemir D., Ayhan Baser D., Aksoy H., Fidanci I., Cankurtaran M., While studies on covid-19 vaccine is ongoing, the public’s thoughts and attitudes to the future covid-19 vaccine, Int J Clin Pract, 75, (2020); Aljameel S.S., Alabbad D.A., Alzahrani N.A., Alqarni S.M., Alamoudi F.A., Babili L.M., Aljaafary S.K., Alshamrani F.M., A sentiment analysis approach to predict an individual’s awareness of the precautionary procedures to prevent covid-19 outbreaks in saudi arabia, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 18, 1, (2021); Anis E., Preis S.A., Cedar N., Tal Y., Hershkowitz I., Hershko A.Y., Reporting of allergic reactions during Pfizer-Biontech bntt162b2 vaccination in Israel, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 10, 11, pp. 2969-2976, (2022); Bell S., Clarke R., Mounier-Jack S., Walker J.L., Paterson P., Parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future covid-19 vaccine: a multi-methods study in england, Vaccine, 38, 49, pp. 7789-7798, (2020); Chandra Y., Jana A., Sentiment analysis using machine learning and deep learning, 2020 7Th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (Indiacom), pp. 1-4, (2020); Dror A.A., Eisenbach N., Taiber S., Morozov N.G., Mizrachi M., Zigron A., Srouji S., Sela E., Vaccine hesitancy: the next challenge in the fight against Covid-19, Eur J Epidemiol, 35, 8, pp. 775-779, (2020); Dubey A.D., Public sentiment analysis of covid-19 vaccination drive in India, (2021); Jain P.K., Pamula R., A Systematic Literature Review on Machine Learning Applications for Consumer Sentiment Analysis Using Online Reviews, (2020); Journal T.W.S., Vaccine Manufacturing Issues Force Moderna to Cut Supplies to Canada, (2021); Kang G.J., Ewing-Nelson S.R., Mackey L., Schlitt J.T., Marathe A., Abbas K.M., Swarup S., Semantic network analysis of vaccine sentiment in online social media, Vaccine, 35, 29, pp. 3621-3638, (2017); Mahajan R., Romine W., Miller M., Banerjee T., Analyzing public outlook towards vaccination using twitter, 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 2763-2772, (2019); Mascellino M.T., Di Timoteo F., de Angelis M., Oliva A., Overview of the main anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines: Mechanism of action, efficacy and safety, Infection and Drug Resistance, pp. 3459-3476, (2021); Mostafa L., Machine learning-based sentiment analysis for analyzing the travelers reviews on egyptian hotels, Joint European-Us Workshop on Applications of Invariance in Computer Vision, pp. 405-413, (2020); Murphy J., Vallieres F., Bentall R.P., Shevlin M., McBride O., Hartman T.K., McKay R., Bennett K., Mason L., Gibson-Miller J., Et al., Psychological characteristics associated with Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in Ireland and the united kingdom, Nat Commun, 12, 1, pp. 1-15, (2021); NCT04283461 C (2020) Safety and Immunogenicity Study of 2019-Ncov Vaccine (Mrna-1273) for Prophylaxis Sars Cov-2 Infection.

Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a category of services that offers considerable potential for organisations to extract valuable insights from their data while reducing the requirement for heavy technical expertise. This article explores the use of MLaaS within the realm of marketing applications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of MLaaS implementations and their benefits within the domain of marketing. Furthermore, we present a platform that possesses the capability to be customised and expanded to address marketing’s unique requirements. Three modules are introduced: Churn Prediction, One-2-One Product Recommendation, and Send Frequency Prediction. When applied to marketing, the proposed MLaaS system exhibits considerable promise for use in applications such as automated detection of client churn prior to its occurrence, individualised product recommendations, and send time optimisation. Our study revealed that AI-driven campaigns can improve both the Open Rate and Click Rate. This approach has the potential to enhance customer engagement and retention for businesses while enabling well-informed decisions by leveraging insights derived from consumer data.

Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.","decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization","Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Decision-focused learning; Differentiable greedy; Edge bundling; End to end; End-to-end learning; Graph visualization; Influence maximizations; Influential nodes; Maximization problem; Model prediction; Data visualization","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE).","Chen W., Wang C., Wang Y., Scalable Influence Maximization for Prevalent Viral Marketing in Large-Scale Social Networks, Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’10, pp. 1029-1038; Bond R., Fariss C., Jones J., Kramer A., Marlow C., Settle J., Fowler J., A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization, Nature, 489, pp. 295-298, (2012); Bedi M., Social networks, government surveillance, and the Fourth Amendment Mosaic Theory, BUL Rev, 94, (2014); Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’03, pp. 137-146; Sakaue S., Differentiable Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization: Guarantees, Gradient Estimators, and Applications, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 130, pp. 28-36, (2021); Anscombe F.J., Graphs in Statistical Analysis, Am.

Incorrect disposal practices can lead to pharmacopollution, which poses significant risks to environmental integrity and human well-being. Involving medicine users in waste management empowers them to take responsibility for their waste and make informed decisions to safeguard the environment and public health. The objective of this research was to contribute to the prevention of pharmacopollution by identifying influential factors that promote responsible disposal practices among medicine users. Factors such as attitude, marketing campaigns, collection points, safe handling, medical prescription, package contents, and public policies and laws were examined. To analyze the complex relationships and interactions among these factors, a dual-staged approach was employed, utilizing advanced statistical modeling techniques and deep learning artificial neural network algorithms. Data were collected from 952 respondents in Pernambuco, a state in northeastern Brazil known for high rates of pharmacopollution resulting from improper disposal of household medical waste. The results of the study indicated that the propositions related to safety in handling and medical prescription were statistically rejected in the structural equation modeling (SEM) model. However, in the artificial neural network (ANN) model, these two propositions were found to be important predictors of cooperative behavior, highlighting the ANN’s ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between variables. The findings emphasize the significance of user cooperation and provide insights for the development of effective strategies and policies to address pharmacopollution. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; consumer behavior; deep learning; home waste medicine; pharmacopollution; structural equation modeling","Brazil; Pernambuco; artificial neural network; consumption behavior; environmental factor; exploration; machine learning; medicine; numerical model; waste management","","","","","Fundação Antônio dos Santos Abranches; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (Code/001); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","Funding text 1: This study was funded by Fundação Antônio dos Santos Abranches and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—(Grant Code/001).; Funding text 2: This work was partially supported by Fundação Antônio dos Santos Abranches and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior.

Central to this approach is an iterative model that adapts teaching strategies to keep pace with technological advancements and industry demands. The framework emphasizes practical application, steering curriculum development towards the inclusion of AI tools like machine learning and predictive analytics, and crafting experiential learning opportunities. A focused examination of current teaching methods reveals gaps and introduces actionable solutions for fostering analytical skills essential for the AI-enhanced marketing landscape. The model not only advocates for a balance between theory and practice but also addresses challenges such as resource accessibility and the necessity of ethical considerations in AI education. By promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and continual curriculum refreshment, the paper positions the model as an essential blueprint for nurturing future marketing professionals capable of leveraging AI analytics for strategic decision-making. The conclusion calls for academia-industry partnerships to further enrich marketing education and underscores the importance of this framework in preparing students for successful careers in AI-driven marketing. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","AI-driven marketing analytics;

Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades. The authors then use the components of the model for marketing decisions such as forecasting the success of new albums, conducting album tuning and diagnostics, constructing playlists for different generations of music listeners, and providing contextual recommendations. © American Marketing Association 2021.","Bayesian nonparametrics; big data; data fusion; multimedia; music industry; product recommendations; supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process","","","","","","W.

Driven by the gradual maturity of various technologies, the popularization of Internet and mobile devices, the Internet of Things and cloud computing services, the growth of various data has greatly increased and diversified data. The value of these data can be used to predict consumer behavior, differentiate user groups, develop effective marketing strategies, and create differentiated competitiveness. To predict consumer behavior in purchasing insurance products, this study collected 4,474 insurance transactions from a bank in Tainan, Taiwan. After data preprocessing, the number of available transactions is 3,430. In these organized transactions, we use the classification of the insurance product as the dependent variable and the features of the customer as the independent variable. Then, correlation analysis was performed by chi-square test, and uncorrelated factors were analyzed. Analyze influencing factors through a decision tree machine learning model. According to the analysis results of the decision tree model, the accuracy rate is almost 70%, and the most important influencing factors are the actual insurance fee and currency. These two influencing factors can be used as a reference for the precise marketing of Tainan Bank in Taiwan. © 2023 Institute of Information Science.

In Asia, Malaysia as an Islamic country is one of the early adopters with a high level of awareness on cryptocurrency. This paper aims to investigate the factors affecting the investment decision in cryptocurrency among potential investors in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 200 individuals aged 18 years and over. The hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares – structural equation modeling technique. Findings: Results showed that attitude toward risk and perceived behavioral control have a significant positive effect on the investor’s investment decision in cryptocurrency. Interestingly, machine learning forecasting enhances the relationship between perceived benefits and the investment decision in cryptocurrency. Practical implications: Results benefit investors and practitioners on the significant determinants of investment decision in cryptocurrency in emerging market. Originality/value: Despite having high volatility and complexity in price determination, and being decentralized, cryptocurrency has managed to attract many investors due to reasons less explored. The outcome of this study extends the theory of planned behavior and confirms the role of machine learning forecasting as a moderator in the context of cryptocurrency investment. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude towards risk; Cryptocurrency; Emerging market; Investment; Islamic; Islamic financial services marketing; Islamic marketing; Islamic markets; Machine learning; Subjective norm; Trade with the Islamic world","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/SS01/USM/02/14)","The authors would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for the financial support of this paper.

However, when machine learning is used for decision-making, bias rooted in unrepresentative datasets, inadequate models, weak algorithm designs, or human stereotypes can lead to low performance and unfair decisions, resulting in financial, social, and reputational losses. This paper offers a systematic, interdisciplinary literature review of machine learning biases as well as methods to avoid and mitigate these biases. We identified eight distinct machine learning biases, summarized these biases in the cross-industry standard process for data mining to account for all phases of machine learning projects, and outline twenty-four mitigation methods. We further contextualize these biases in a real-world case study and illustrate adequate mitigation strategies. These insights synthesize the literature on machine learning biases in a concise manner and point to the importance of human judgment for machine learning algorithms. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Case study; Machine learning; Mitigation methods","","","","","","Academy of Marketing Science","Dennis Herhausen (Ph.D., University of St.Gallen) is Associate Professor of Marketing at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

However, the abundance of user-generated content data makes it challenging to analyze and derive insights from it. As a result, the demand for sentiment analysis research has increased. This work intends to highlight the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis through a bibliometric analysis. To our knowledge, bibliometric research of sentiment analysis on user-generated content has never been conducted. The research methodology adopted for this study was essentially divided into four phases. Those phases include data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis and report writing. This bibliometric research successfully identified the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis. This study will give a baseline for future researchers to start another study. Big data, text analytics, text mining, tourism, covid-19, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, making predictions, and marketing decisions are among the most recent research interests for sentiment analysis of user-generated content. However, there is a lack of research on those particular topics. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

The appeal of socio-demographic data for customer relationship marketing is based on its low acquisition cost and the growing array of variables on which marketers can condition messages and offers. We reinvestigate the value of socio-demographic variables, focusing on the potential of machine learning procedures (MLPs) to extract a stronger and reliable signal than the standard linear-in-parameters (logistic) regression models. We explore how predictive power can be increased through the nonlinearities and interactions identified with MLPs; our experimental set ranges from well-established procedures to newer entrants in this space. We also examine causality vis-à-vis predictability using a propensity scoring approach. Empirics are based on six grocery product categories and more than 7,000 panelists. We find that, relative to logistic regression models, MLPs using demographic variables yield a 20% to 33% improvement in out-of-sample predictive accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Buy–no buy; Consumer targeting; Machine learning; Propensity score; Socio-demographic variables","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (430199); Australian Research Council, ARC","Funding text 1: Dr. Towhid Islam is a Professor of Marketing and Consumer Studies and University Research Leadership Chair at the University of Guelph, Canada.

This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Credit scoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power-law distribution; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence","","","","","","Top Innovation Graduate Student Cultivation Project Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71671048); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Guangdong University of Technology, GDUT, (262515006); Guangdong University of Technology, GDUT","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71671048]; Guangdong Construction of High-Level Colleges for Postgraduate Study Abroad Project in Guangdong University of Technology [grant number 262515006]; and Top Innovation Graduate Student Cultivation Project Fund.","Ahelegbey D.F., Giudici P., Hadji-Misheva B., Latent factor models for credit scoring in P2P systems, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 522, pp. 112-121, (2019); Baesens B., Van Gestel T., Viaene S., Stepanova M., Suykens J., Vanthienen J., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 6, pp. 627-635, (2003); Bayer J., Customer segmentation in the telecommunications industry, Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management, 17, 3-4, pp. 247-256, (2010); Benkedjouh T., Medjaher K., Zerhouni N., Rechak S., Health assessment and life prediction of cutting tools based on support vector regression, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 26, 2, pp. 213-223, (2015); Candel A., Parmar V., LeDell E., Arora A., Deep Learning with H2O, pp. 1-21, (2016); Chang S.-Y., Yeh T.-Y., An artificial immune classifier for credit scoring analysis, Applied Soft Computing, 12, 2, pp. 611-618, (2012); Chester D.L., Why two hidden layers are better than one, Proc.

Traditionally, people use Google and other search platforms to research a product before purchasing. However, with the integration of ChatGPT into Bing and Google’s announcement of BARD, these models have the potential to impact how customers search for and discover products significantly. This article aims to understand whether people will shift from traditional to Generative AI-based search engines. The research examines the factors influencing purchase decisions and the likelihood of individuals using ChatGPT instead of traditional search engines and other sources. The results indicate that gender, product knowledge, and preference for online or retail store purchases can help predict their inclination to switch to ChatGPT. The paper also discusses people’s trust in Generative AI and the influence of demographic features on their attitude toward these machine learning systems. © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","Digital marketing; generative AI; product research","Learning systems; Retail stores; Sales; Demographic features; Digital marketing; Generative AI; Google+; Machine learning systems; Product information; Product knowledge; Product research; Purchase decision; Search engines","","","","","","","Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Improving language understanding by generative pre-training, (2018); Wang F.Y., Miao Q., Li X., Wang X., Lin Y., What does ChatGPT say: the DAO from algorithmic intelligence to linguistic intelligence, IEEE/CAA J Autom Sinica, 10, 3, pp. 575-579, (2023); Zarifhonarvar A., Economics of ChatGPT: a labor market view on the occupational impact of artificial intelligence; Kurian N., Cherian J.M., Sudharson N.A., Varghese K.G., Wadhwa S., AI is now everywhere, Br Dent J, 234, 2, (2023); Weizenbaum J., ELIZA a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine, Comput Linguist, 9, 1, pp. 36-45, (1966); Lenat D., Prakash M., Shepherd M., CYC: using common sense knowledge to overcome brittleness and knowledge acquisition bottlenecks, AI Mag, 6, 4, (1985); Shadbolt N., Hall W., Berners-Lee T., The semantic web revisited, IEEE Intell Syst, 21, 3, pp. 96-101, (2006); Ferrucci D., Levas A., Bagchi S., Gondek D., Mueller E.T., Watson: beyond jeopardy!, Artif Intell, 199, 200, pp. 93-105, (2013); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, (2017); Paulheim H., Knowledge graph refinement: a survey of approaches and evaluation methods, Semantic Web, 8, pp. 489-508, (2017); Chen L., Jiang M., Jia F., Liu G., Artificial intelligence adoption in business-to-business marketing: toward a conceptual framework, J Bus Ind Mark, 37, 5, pp. 1025-1044, (2022); Stone M., Aravopoulou E., Ekinci Y., Evans G., Hobbs M., Labib A., Laughlin P., Machtynger J., Machtynger L., Artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic marketing decision-making: a research agenda, Bottom Line, 33, 2, pp. 183-200, (2020); Frieder S., Pinchetti L., Griffiths R.R., Salvatori T., Lukasiewicz T., Petersen P.C., Chevalier A., Berner J., Mathematical capabilities of ChatGPT, (2023); Geerling W., Dirk Mateer G., Wooten J., Damodaran N., ChatGPT has mastered the principles of economics: now what?, SSRN Electron J; Sun C., Shi Z., Liu X., Ghose A., Li X., Xiong F., The effect of voice AI on consumer purchase and search behavior, (2021); GiachosI I., Papakitsos E.C., Savvidis P., Laskaris N., Inquiring natural language processing capabilities on robotic systems through virtual assistants: a systemic approach, J Comput Sci Res, 5, 2, pp. 28-36, (2023); Sakirin T., Ben Said R., User preferences for ChatGPT-powered conversational interfaces versus traditional methods, Meso J Comput Sci, pp. 24-31, (2023); Priya B., Sharma V., Exploring users’ adoption intentions of intelligent virtual assistants in financial services: an anthropomorphic perspectives and socio-psychological perspectives, Comput Hum Behav, 148, (2023); Ruggeri K., Kacha O., Menezes I.G., Kos M., Franklin M., Parma L., Langdon P., Matthews B., Miles J., In with the new?

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the efficiency scores of decision-making units’ efficiency (DMUs) are obtained using an input-oriented DEA model under the assumption of a variable return to scale. Based on these scores, the DMUs are classified into efficient and inefficient categories. The 2nd stage of analysis involves the identification of the most important predictors of efficiency using a random forest model and a generalized logistic regression model. Findings: The results show that by using their resources efficiently, growers can reduce their inputs by 34 percent without affecting the output. Orchard's size, the proportion of land, grower's age, orchard's age and family labor are the most important determinants of efficiency. Besides, growers' main occupation and footfall of intermediaries at the farm gate also demonstrate significant influence on efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The study used only one output and a limited set of input variables. Incorporating additional variables or dimensions like fertility of the land, climatic conditions, altitude of the land, output quality (size/taste/appearance) and per acre profitability could yield more robust results. Although pineapple is cultivated in all eight northeastern states, the data for the study has been collected from only two states. The production and marketing practices followed by the growers in the remaining six northeastern states and other parts of the country might be different. As the growers do not maintain farm records, their data might suffer from selective retrieval bias. Practical implications: Given the rising demand for organic food, improving the efficiency of chemical-free growers will be a win-win situation for both growers and consumers. The results will aid policymakers in bringing necessary interventions to make chemical-free farming more remunerative for the growers. The business managers can act as a bridge to connect these remote growers with the market by sharing customer feedback and global best practices. Social implications: Although many developments have happened to the DEA technique, the present study used a traditional form of DEA. Therefore, future research should combine ML techniques with more advanced versions like bootstrap and fuzzy DEA. Upcoming research should include more input and output variables to predict the efficiency of the chemical-free farming system. For instance, environmental variables, like climatic conditions, degree of competition, government support and consumers' attitude towards chemical-free food, can be examined along with farm and grower-specific variables. Future studies should also incorporate chemical-free growers from a wider geographic area. Lastly, future studies can also undertake a longitudinal estimation of efficiency and its determinants for the chemical-free farming system. Originality/value: No prior study has used a hybrid framework to examine the performance of a chemical-free farming system. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Chemical-free farming; Data envelopment analysis; Machine learning; Technical efficiency","","","","","","","","Ahmed M.H., Melesse K.A., Impact of off-farm activities on technical efficiency: evidence from maize producers of eastern Ethiopia, Agricultural and Food Economics, 6, 3, (2018); Alvarez R., Comparing productivity of organic and conventional farming systems: a quantitative review, Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science, (2021); Asante-Addo C., Mockshell J., Zeller M., Siddig K., Egyir I.S., Agricultural credit provision: what really determines farmers' participation and credit rationing?, Agricultural Finance Review, (2017); Aslam M.S., Xue P.H., Bashir S., Alfakhri Y., Nurunnabi M., Nguyen V.C., Assessment of rice and wheat production efficiency based on data envelopment analysis, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, (2021); Banker R.D., Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Some models for estimating technical and scale inefficiencies in data envelopment analysis, Management Science, (1984); Bauman A., Thilmany D., Jablonski B.B.R., Evaluating scale and technical efficiency among farms and ranches with a local market orientation, Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems, (2019); Bennett M., Franzel S., Can organic and resource-conserving agriculture improve livelihoods?

However, rare quantitative evidence was detected about the best human presenting percentage and how it affects the intention. In this study, we decoded how human elements (presence or absence, low or high proportion) affect viewers' perceptions and intentions in nature/culture-based photographs. Innovatively, three deep learning models and two experiments were integrated. The results indicate that (1) in general, maintaining the proportion of human elements at less than 1% leads to the best positive perception, and (2) the viewers demonstrate different perceptions and intentions in viewing nature-based and culture-based photographs with the human element. Theoretically, we bring a new perspective and approach to understanding the marketing value of human elements in tourist-generated photographs. Practically, we provide specific and different clues in choosing photographs to promote cultural and natural destinations regarding human elements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral intentions; Deep learning model; Destination perception; Human elements; Tourist-generated photographs","behavioral response; machine learning; perception; photograph; tourism development; tourist destination","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21BJY166)","Thanks to the National Social Science Fund of China ( 21BJY166 ) for supporting this research.","Agrawal J., Kamakura W.A., The economic worth of celebrity endorsers: An event study analysis, Journal of Marketing, 59, 3, pp. 56-62, (1995); Ang L., Hellmann A., Kanbaty M., Sood S., Emotional and attentional influences of photographs on impression management and financial decision making, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 27, (2020); Arefieva V., Egger R., Yu J., A machine learning approach to cluster destination image on Instagram, Tourism Management, 85, (2021); Back R.M., Park J., Bufquin D., Nutta M.W.W., Lee S.J., Effects of hotel website photograph size and human images on perceived transportation and behavioral intentions, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 89, (2020); Bakhshi S., Shamma D., Gilbert E., Faces engage us: Photos with faces, Attract More Likes and Comments on Instagram, (2014); Balomenou N., Garrod B., Photographs in tourism research: Prejudice, power, performance and participant-generated images, Tourism Management, 70, pp. 201-217, (2019); Berg B.L., Qualitative research methods for the social sciences, (1989); Chen L., Papandreou G., Schroff F., Adam H., Rethinking atrous convolution for semantic image segmentation, (2017); Cohen J., Statistical power analysis, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 1, 3, pp. 98-101, (1992); Dann G.M.S., Images of Cyprus projected by tour operators, Problemy Turystyki, 11, 3, pp. 43-70, (1988); Decrop A., Group processes in vacation decision-making, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 18, 3, pp. 23-36, (2005); Deng N., Li X.R., Feeling a destination through the “right” photos: A machine learning model for DMOs' photo selection, Tourism Management, 65, pp. 267-278, (2018); Deng N., Liu J., Where did you take those photos?

This topic has long gone beyond the information sphere, as it now applies to almost every sphere of life: economic, telecommunications, education, medicine, administration, and especially defense. Predicting customer behavior based on scoring models is in its infancy in Ukrainian companies, the main ones being the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning, which will be the leading catalyst that will facilitate decision-making in business in the nearest future. The aim of the study is to develop a scoring model that predicts the behavior of target segments, namely, updating their activity to activate advertising tools. To achieve the goal of the work a set of research methods was used: dialectical-to reveal the theoretical foundations of models and types of forecasting models; analytical-in the study of the functioning of the environment SAS, Anaconda; optimization methods-to choose the best model and generate features. Scientific novelty and theoretical significance lie in the development of a scoring model for predicting the activity of subscribers of the telecommunications company ""VF Ukraine"", on the basis of which marketing campaigns are conducted. With the help of the built-in scoring model, the company ""VF Ukraine""can target its campaigns to retain subscribers. The marketing directorate of the enterprise can choose the TOP-20 or TOP-30 of the most prone subscribers to non-resumption of activity, i.e., tend to switch to other mobile operators, and hold promotions for them-providing additional gifts and bonuses, money to mobile account.  © 2022 Tetiana Zatonatska et al., published by Sciendo.","advertising; big data; market segment; scoring models; target; telecommunication sector","","","","","","","","Airola A., Pahikkala T., Waegeman W., De Baets B., Salakoski T., An experimental comparison of cross-validation techniques for estimating the area under the ROC-curve, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 55, 4, pp. 1828-1844, (2011); Celisse A., Optimal cross-validation in density estimation with the L<sup>2</sup>-loss, The Annals of Statistics, 42, 5, pp. 1879-1910, (2014); Dai D., Identifying dissatisfied 4G customers from network indicators: A comparison between complaint and survey data, Big Data Applications in the Telecommunications Industry, pp. 41-53, (2017); Dang Ch, Network-based targeting: Big Data application in mobile industry, Big Data Applications in the Telecommunications Industry, pp. 78-107, (2017); Deroos D., Zikopoulos P.C., Melnyk R.B., Brown B., Coss R., Hadoop for dummies, (2014); Dluhopolskyi O., Simakhova A., Zatonatska T., Oleksiv I., Kozlovskyi S., Potential of virtual reality in the current digital society: economic perspectives, 11th International Conference on Advanced Computer Information Technologies, (2021); pp. 360-363; Fawcett T., An introduction to ROC analysis, Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 8, pp. 861-874, (2006); Goworek D., The big impact of Big Data on the telecom industry, (2021); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., Elements of Statistical Learning: data mining, inference, and prediction, (2017); Hssina B., Merbouha A., Ezzikouri H., Erritali M., A comparative study of decision tree ID3 and C4.5, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), Special Issue on Advances in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networking and Applications, pp. 13-19, (2014); Kuhn M., Johnson K., Applied Predictive Modeling, (2013); Lurie A., 39 Data Visualization Tools for Big Data, (2014); Discover Feature Engineering, How to Engineer Features and How to Get Good at It, (2015); McLachlan G.J., Do K.-A., Ambroise C., Analyzing microarray gene expression data, (2004); Molinaro A.M., Simon R., Pfeiffer R.M., Prediction error estimation: A comparison of resampling methods, Bioinformatics, 21, 15, pp. 3301-3307, (2005); Mykhalchuk T., Zatonatska T., Dluhopolskyi O., Zhukovska A., Dluhopolska T., Liakhovych L., Development of recommendation system in e-commerce using emotional analysis and machine learning methods, The 11th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications (IDAACS), 1, pp. 527-535, (2021); Perkhofer L., Walchshofer C., Hofer P., Does design matter when visualizing Big Data?

A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

This study addresses this imperative by conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews on smartwatches, aiming to determine the pivotal factors guiding consumer purchasing decisions. By employing word clouds to visually represent sentiments, the study uncovers notable trends. Positive reviews prominently highlight the term “quality”, suggesting a strong emphasis on product excellence. In contrast, negative reviews were characterized by the prevalence of the term “fake”, indicating concerns related to authenticity. Additionally, a comparative assessment of two machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines and Naive Bayes, demonstrates that support vector machines exhibit superior accuracy in classification. These findings offer valuable insights for industry practitioners navigating the competitive landscape of the smartwatch market, providing actionable information for optimizing product features and refining marketing strategies to meet consumer expectations. © 2024 by the author(s).

Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods","","","","","","","","Birant D, Data mining using RFM analysis, Knowledge-oriented applications in data mining (IntechOpen), (2011); Chang CJ, A Decision Support System for Audit Staff Scheduling of Multiple and Large-Scaled Engagements, Rev Bus Inf Syst, 6, pp. 27-40, (2002); De Haan E, Wiesel T, Pauwels K, The effectiveness of different forms of online advertising for purchase conversion in a multiple-channel attribution framework, Int J Res Mark, 33, pp. 491-507, (2016); Dodin B, Huang Chan K, Application of production scheduling methods to external and internal audit scheduling, Eur J Oper Res, 52, pp. 267-279, (1991); Edvardsson B, Gustafsson A, Roos I, Service portraits in service research: a critical review, International J Serv Ind Manage, 16, pp. 107-121, (2005); Grewala D, Roggeveen AL, Understanding Retail Experiences and Customer Journey Management, J Retailing, 96, pp. 3-8, (2020); Han DL, Tang LC, Huang HC, A Markov model for single-leg air cargo revenue management under a bid-price policy, Eur J Oper Res, 200, pp. 800-811, (2010); He B, Shi Y, Wan Q, Et al., Prediction of customer attrition of commercial banks based on SVM model, Pro Comput Sci, 31, pp. 423-430, (2014); Huang CY, Shen YC, Chiang IP, Et al., Characterizing Web users’ online information behavior, J Am Society Inf Sci Technol, 58, pp. 1988-1997, (2007); Klein R, Sebastian K, Steinhardt C, Et al., A review of revenue management: Recent generalizations and advances in industry applications, Eur J Oper Res, 284, pp. 397-412, (2020); Kraus M, Feuerriegel S, Oztekin A, Deep learning in business analytics and operations research: Models, applications and managerial implications, Eur J Oper Res, 281, pp. 628-641, (2020); Lemon KN, Verhoef PC, Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey, J Mark, 80, (2016); Mainak S, Bruyn AD, LSTM Response Models for Direct Marketing Analytics: Replacing Feature Engineering with Deep Learning, J Interact Mark, 53, pp. 80-95, (2021); Strauss AK, Klein R, Steinhardt C, A review of choice-based revenue management: Theory and methods, Eur J Oper Res, 271, pp. 375-387, (2018); Sun C, Adamopoulos P, Ghose A, Et al., Predicting stages in omnichannel path to purchase: A deep learning model, Inf Syst Res, 33, pp. 429-445, (2022)","T.-C.

To do so,we synthesize and extend recent advances in causal machine learning techniques to capture heterogeneity in the content of the email subject line itself as well as heterogeneous consumer responses to the promotional offers and semantic choices contained therein. We find that content and framing are important for driving performance. We identify precise causal estimates of the effects of individual deal components, personalized content, and various semantic choices on consumer outcomes all theway down the conversion funnel. The decompositional nature of our methodology allows us to show how different combinations of key words and promotional inducements produce significantly different outcomes, both within a given stage and across all stages of the funnel. Notably, discounts framed as clearance events sharply outperform those tied to particular products. We also find components that drive engagement at the top of the funnel don’t always lead to conversion at the bottom: their efficacy, across the funnel, is significantly moderated by the engagement levels of the consumers who receive them. Finally, leveraging both aspects of heterogeneity,we use off-policy evaluation to demonstrate the potential for significant gains fromimproved targeting. © 2023, INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analysis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attracting new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing investments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and business indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports.

This paper develops realist evaluation methods to explain under which conditions four European DMMOs adopt a relevant group of indicators (acquisition), to provide meaning to these indicators (assimilation), which creates the conditions to make indicator-informed decisions (transformation) that can eventually generate benefits attributable to the use of indicators (exploitation). The methodological novelty of this paper is the use of outcome mapping to systematically outline the process of data collection and analysis to reach the context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining the factors that facilitate or impede the absorptive capacity in these DMMOs. Interventions to increase the uptake of sustainability indicators need to create better opportunities for DMMOs’ formal and informal learning; to use indicators to disrupt prevalent mindsets; with easily understandable data that is perceived as relevant to their needs. © 2023 The Authors","Absorptive capacity; Destination marketing/management organisations; Evidence-based policy; Outcome mapping; Sustainable tourism indicator","Europe; absorption; governance approach; machine learning; mapping method; sustainability; tourism development; tourist destination","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (890281); European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: This paper has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska Curie grant agreement No 890281 . ; Funding text 2: This paper has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska Curie grant agreement No 890281.","Amore A., Hall M., From governance to meta-governance in tourism?

However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agricultural decision support system; Agricultural supply chain; Market intelligence system; Optimal marketing strategy; Predictive modelling; Risk management","","","","","","Institute of Eminence; Banaras Hindu University, BHU","The authors extend their gratitude for the efforts of the Editor-in-Chief Prof. A.

This problem arises in precision medicine, targeted marketing, personalized education, and many other environments. Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects presents several analytical challenges including high dimensionality and endogeneity issues. We develop a new instrumental variable tree (IVT) approach that incorporates the instrumental variable method into a causal tree (CT) to correct for potential endogeneity biases that may exist in observational data. Our IVT approach partitions subjects into subgroups with similar treatment effects within subgroups and different treatment effects across subgroups. The estimated treatment effects are asymptotically consistent under a set of mild assumptions. Using simulated data, we show our approach has a better coverage rate and smaller mean-squared error than the conventional CT approach. We also demonstrate that an instrumental variable forest (IVF) constructed using IVTs has better accuracy and stratification than a generalized random forest. Finally, by applying the IVF approach to an empirical assessment of laparoscopic colectomy, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity to make accurate comparisons of the heterogeneous effects of the treatment (teaching hospitals) and control (nonteaching hospitals) on different types of patients.

It comprises a set of processes that allows decision-makers to analyze customer data, in order to launch an efficient, customer-centric, and cost-effective marketing strategy. Nonetheless, the inclusion of social media data in CRM introduces new challenges, as it requires advanced analytical approaches to extract actionable insight from such a huge amount of data. Thus, in this paper, we propose a social CRM analytic framework, which includes various analytical approaches, aiming at improving customer retention, acquisition, and conversion. This framework has been tested on various datasets and extensively evaluated based on several performance metrics. The obtained results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively extract relevant information and support decision-making processes. From an academics perspective, the study contributes to an understanding of customers’ experiences throughout their engagement on social media and focuses on long-term relationships with customers. From a managerial perspective, companies should leverage the insight generated through every customer engagement on social media to drive effective marketing strategies. © 2021","Acquisition; Conversion; Customer retention; Customer satisfaction; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social CRM; Social media","Cost effectiveness; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Digital storage; Machine learning; Public relations; Sales; Social networking (online); Strategic planning; Acquisition; Conversion; Customer acquisition; Customer conversion; Customer relationship management; Customer retention; Customers' satisfaction; Sentiment analysis; Social CRM; Social media; decision making; machine learning; management; marketing; social media; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","A Al-Homery H., Asharai H., Ahmad A., The core components and types of CRM, Pakistan Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 7, 1, pp. 121-145, (2019); Agnihotri R., Trainor K.J., Itani O.S., Rodriguez M., Examining the role of sales-based CRM technology and social media use on post-sale service behaviors in India, J.

From financial markets to supply chain management, logistics, and technology legitimacy assessment, sentiment analysis offers insights into public sentiment, actionable data, and improved decision forecasting. This study contributes to this growing body of research by offering a novel multi-view deep learning approach to sentiment analysis that incorporates non-textual features like emojis. The proposed approach considers both textual and emoji views as distinct views of emotional information for the sentiment classification model, and the results acknowledge their individual and combined contributions to sentiment analysis. Comparative analysis with baseline classifiers reveals that incorporating emoji features significantly enriches sentiment analysis, enhancing the accuracy, F1-score, and execution time of the proposed model. Additionally, this study employs LIME for explainable sentiment analysis to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enabling high-stakes businesses to understand the factors driving customer sentiment. The present study contributes to the literature on multi-view text classification in the context of social media and provides an innovative analytics method for businesses to extract valuable emotional information from electronic word of mouth (eWOM), which can help them stay ahead of the competition in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In addition, the findings of this paper have important implications for policy development in digital communication and social media monitoring. Recognizing the importance of emojis in sentiment expression can inform policies by helping them better understand public sentiment and tailor policy solutions that better address the concerns of the public. © 2024 The Author(s)","Explainable sentiment analysis; High-stakes decision forecasting; Marketing analytics; Multi-view learning; Social media reviews","Classification (of information); Commerce; Competition; Construction industry; Decision making; Deep learning; Lime; Social networking (online); Supply chain management; Explainable sentiment analyse; High-stake decision forecasting; Marketing analytic; Multi-view learning; Multi-views; Public sentiments; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social media; Social medium review; classification; decision making; machine learning; marketing; social media; Sentiment analysis","","","","","VC Research, (VCR 0000207)","Prof Chang's work is partly supported by VC Research ( VCR 0000207 ).

The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted. Finally, this work shows and compares the classification results obtained with the combination of sampling techniques and Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and Artificial Neural Networks. The testing approach follows a walk-forward validation procedure, which simulates a production environment and reveals the ability to accurately classify each future campaign. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","direct marketing;

Although the dramatic growth of algorithmic decision making continues to gain momentum in marketing, research in this stream is still inadequate despite the devastating, asymmetric and oppressive impacts of algorithmic bias on various customer groups. To fill this void, this study presents a framework identifying the sources of algorithmic bias in marketing, drawing on the microfoundations of dynamic capability. Using a systematic literature review and in-depth interviews of ML professionals, the findings of the study show three primary dimensions (i.e., design bias, contextual bias and application bias) and ten corresponding subdimensions (model, data, method, cultural, social, personal, product, price, place and promotion). Synthesizing diverse perspectives using both theories and practices, we propose a framework to build a dynamic algorithm management capability to tackle algorithmic bias in ML-based marketing decision making. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Algorithmic bias; Data bias; Design bias; Dynamic managerial capability; Machine learning; Marketing models; Microfoundations; Socio-cultural bias","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Australian Research Council, ARC","Dr Katina Michael is a professor at Arizona State University in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence.

We begin by introducing the forecasting problems that retailers face, from the strategic to the operational, as sales are aggregated over products to stores and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches. The paper concludes by describing company forecasting practices, offering conclusions as to both research gaps and barriers to improved practice. © 2019 International Institute of Forecasters","Comparative accuracy; Forecasting practice; Marketing analytics; New products; Product hierarchies; Retail forecasting; Social media data","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71571089, 71673122)"," We are pleased to acknowledge the substantial help given by many colleagues and the paper’s formal referees who offered comments, leading, we hope, to an improved and more valuable review paper; also by those retailers who shared information on their practices and the issues they face. One theme that the commentators and references all had in common was that the paper was long; however, in the end we decided that there was little to be done about it, not least because the criticism was often accompanied by a request to expand on one topic or another!

The novel social network based on internet technology occupies an important part of the marketing, and has also been widely concerned by the academic community, because the internet makes information data transparent, and the mining, analysis and algorithm research of a large amount of data can provide decision support for marketing and intelligent marketing. Modern data mining analysis mode has become the main solution for data problems. With the development of network technology, business intelligence related to the marketing of high-tech products will become the key component of the future business system, which depends on the overall architecture of the cloud and plays a core role in the process of data analysis and mining. © 2022, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy. After applying the decomposition part, the results have RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values of 49.59%, 22.58%, and 21.99% lower than those of the individual prediction part, respectively. This research presents a novel approach for market participants in the soybean industry for risk response. It gives a new perspective on agricultural product prices in sustainable agricultural marketing, while also providing practical tools for developing public policies and decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","CEEMDAN; CNN-GRU-Attention; fuzzy entropy; soybean spot price","China; cluster analysis; entropy; fuzzy mathematics; soybean; sustainability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71573042, 71973028)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 71573042 and 71973028.","Yao H., Zuo X., Zuo D., Lin H., Huang X., Zang C., Study on soybean potential productivity and food security in China under the influence of COVID-19 outbreak, Geogr.

The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

The customer character model (i.e restricted model) is compared to a full model consisting of the 4 Cs of capacity, collateral, credit, and character of churn prediction. The results reveal that there is a difference between the full model and the customer character model. Additionally, different supervised classification methods, such as logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision trees (DTs), and random forests (RFs), are applied and compared in terms of multiple predictive performance measures. The RF classification measures report the strongest performance. Additionally, different classification methods suggest the importance of different customer character variables. Therefore, from a practical perspective, effective borrower character screening is recommended to determine customer profiles more accurately for the purposes of target marketing and customer retention. This study also deepens understanding of subprime credit markets and reveals additional insights to credit screening using machine learning techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","4 Cs; Auto loans; Churn; Classification techniques; Credit screening; Machine learning; Subprime; Supervised learning","","","","","","","","Abu-Nimeh S.D., Nappa X., Wangnair S., A comparison of machine learning techniques for phishing detection, Proceedings of the Anti-Phishing Working Groups 2Nd Annual Ecrime Researchers Summit, pp. 60-69, (2007); Agarwal S., Ambrose B.W., Chomsisengphet S., Determinants of automobile loan default and prepayment, Economic Perspectives, 32, 3, pp. 17-27, (2008); Ahn Y., Kim D., Lee D.-J., Customer attrition analysis in the securities industry: A large-scale field study in Korea, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 38, 3, pp. 561-577, (2019); Ali O.G., Ariturk U., Dynamic churn prediction framework with more effective use of rare event data: The case of private banking, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 17, pp. 7889-7903, (2014); Assis C., Subprime Car Loans aren’t Subprime Mortgages Yet Still Worry Jamie Dimon and Now, John Oliver, (2016); Axelton K., How to Get a Used Car Loan, Experian, (2020); Barboza F., Kimura H., Altman E., Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); Braun M., Schweidel D.A., Modeling customer lifetimes with multiple causes of churn, Marketing Science, 30, 5, pp. 881-902, (2011); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Buckinx W., Van den Poel D., Customer base analysis: Partial defection of behaviorally loyal clients in a non-contractual FMCG retail setting, European Journal of Operational Research, 164, 1, pp. 252-268, (2005); Butler A.W.E.J., Mayerweston J., Racial Discrimination in the Auto Loan Market, (2020); Chawla N., Data mining for imbalanced datasets: An overview, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 875-886, (2009); Chen K., Hu Y., Hsieh Y., Predicting customer churn from valuable B2B customers in the logistics industry: A case study, Information Systems and E-Business Management, 13, 3, pp. 475-494, (2015); Chiang D.A., Wang Y.F., Lee S.L., Lin C.J., Goal-oriented sequential pattern for network banking churn analysis, Expert Systems with Applications, 25, 3, pp. 293-302, (2003); Clarke K.A., The phantom menace: Omitted variable bias in econometric research, Conflict Management and Peace Science, 22, 4, pp. 341-352, (2005); Courchane M.J., Surette B.J., Zorn P.M., Subprime borrowers: Mortgage transitions and outcomes, The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 29, 4, pp. 365-392, (2004); Coussement K., De Bock K.W., Customer churn prediction in the online gambling industry: The beneficial effect of ensemble learning, Journal of Business Research, 66, 9, pp. 1629-1636, (2013); Coussement K., Lessmann S., Verstraeten G., A comparative analysis of data preparation algorithms for customer churn prediction: A case study in the telecommunication industry, Decision Support Systems, 95, pp. 27-36, (2017); Coussement K., Van den Poel D., Churn prediction in subscription services: An application of support vector machines while comparing two parameter-selection techniques, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 1, pp. 313-327, (2008); Used Car Market Report & Outlook Forecast Higher Used-Vehicle Sales for 2018 and a Decline in New-Car Sales, (2018); De Caigny A., Coussement K., De Bock K.W., A new hybrid classification algorithm for customer churn prediction based on logistic regression and decision trees, European Journal of Operational Research, 269, 2, pp. 760-772, (2018); Delen D., A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management, Decision Support Systems, 49, 4, pp. 498-506, (2010); Denison D.G., Mallick B.K., Smith A.F., A Bayesian CART algorithm, Biometrika, 85, 2, pp. 363-377, (1998); Dogrusubasi N.A., February.

However, DSP platforms often need help with two issues during the auction process: low enthusiasm and unreasonable bidding. To address these problems, we use the second-price sealed auction and propose a framework for multi-round real-time bidding with game machine learning. We introduce a multi-round advertising bidding mechanism incorporating reputation incentive rules to enhance DSP enthusiasm. The aim is to stimulate DSP participation and deter malicious DSP behavior, ensuring fairness and transparency in the bidding process. Subsequently, we design an auction screening model and adopt a multi-round auction format to ensure that only capable and willing advertising demand partners can participate, thus guaranteeing the reasonableness of DSP bids. Furthermore, we design a real-time bidding mechanism to adapt to the dynamic nature of the IoT marketing market. This mechanism transforms the problem of maximizing DSP revenue under budget constraints into a parameter adjustment problem based on a Markov Decision Process. We then utilize the Double Deep Q Network method to obtain the optimal bidding strategy for DSPs. Ultimately, the results demonstrate that our framework improves the final transaction price by 14.71%, increases the expected click-through rate by an average of 19.35%, and reduces the average cost per thousand impressions by 20.34%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deep reinforcement learning; IoT marketing; Multi-round auctions; Real-time bidding","","","","","","Startup Research Foundation for Distinguished Scholars, China, (202112016); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61872205, 62172377); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2019MF018)","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant numbers 62172377 , 61872205 ], the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [grant number ZR2019MF018 ], and the Startup Research Foundation for Distinguished Scholars, China [grant numbers 202112016 ].","Nguyen D.C., Ding M., Pathirana P.N., Seneviratne A., Li J., Poor H.V., Federated learning for internet of things: A comprehensive survey, IEEE Commun.

Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","COVID Twitter data; Machine learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Conventional machines; COVID twitter data; Feature engineerings; Learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction; Streaming texts; Text analysis; Forecasting","","","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","The authors would like to thank Ali Hussain Khan and Asif Iqbal Middya for their contribution in developing the CitizenSense application.

The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information. The resultant data aids in creating autonomous systems that consider the input from customers and prepare restaurant strategies. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Accuracy; Aspect-based; Classification; Document-based; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Uncertain feedback pool","Data mining; Decision making; Information retrieval systems; Lakes; Machine learning; Accuracy; Aspect-based; Decision-making process; Document-based; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Smart classification; Specific tasks; Uncertain feedback pool; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Chen H., Salem A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages, ACM Transact Inf Syst, 26, 3, pp. 1-34, (2008); Boire R., Data Mining Process.

As the customer base grows, insurance companies must prioritize transitioning to data-driven strategies to cut costs and make more informed marketing choices in today's digital era. This study proposes a new decision-making framework for precision marketing, based on a real case study from a Moroccan insurance company that aims to solve a practical problem. The proposed decision-making system consists of four components, with each component involving important steps. Firstly, data preparation was performed, consisting of four critical stages: data acquisition, data cleaning and filtering, feature selection, and oversampling. Secondly, top 20% and top 50% consumers are taken as examples to present their customer persona in detail. Based on the processed data, we analysed consumer consumption behaviors using four ML algorithms and made a performance comparison of the four algorithms. Additionally, we conducted feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features and evaluate the system's performance. The aim of the proposed precision decision-making system is to assist managers in discerning the distinctive characteristics of potential customers and proposing tailored precision marketing strategies. This approach is expected to substantially reduce advertising expenses and enhance overall marketing efficiency. A case study using real-world data from a Moroccan insurance company was conducted to demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed framework. The results of the study indicate that the proposed system yielded favourable outcomes. © 2024 The Authors","Decision making system; Insurance sector; Machine learning; MRMR; Precision marketing; Relief","","","","","","","","Adiwijaya K., Wahyuni S., Gayatri G., Mussry J.S., Does marketing ambidexterity boost marketing performance?

Accurate crop mapping can help assist decision-making related to storage, marketing, and other production tasks. This study has designed robust crop classification models to classify two major crop types (cereals and canola) in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. These models combined Sentinel 1 and 2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Three methods were applied to test classification quality: the holdout method, leave-one-season-out cross-validation (LOSOCV), and leave-one-cluster-out-cross-validation (LOCOCV). The holdout method evaluated the model's performance on data representing the entire population. The LOSOCV method was used to test the model's ability to extrapolate over time (unseen data from new seasons), and the LOCOCV method was used to test the ability to extrapolate over space (data from a new site). Crop type labelled data (n = 193 for cereals and n = 113 for canola) were extracted from high-resolution yield maps derived from grain yield monitors mounted on harvesters, and this was used to train and validate the classification models. The results showed that the holdout validation approach achieved the highest accuracy (overall and Kappa scores >0.98), but this might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the sampling strategy implemented, which leads to an overoptimistic scenario. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores achieved from the LOSOCV method varied depending upon the difference in crop phenology from season to season, with overall accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 0.92 and Kappa scores from 0.61 to 0.90. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores for the LOCOCV ranged from 0.87 to 0.99 and 0.84 to 0.98, respectively. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and the chlorophyll red edge index (CIr) were the most important features across the three models. The outputs of this research can potentially complement models that require crop type information, such as carbon cycling and crop yield models. © 2024 The Authors","Gross primary productivity; Machine learning; Optical remote sensing; Radar; Yield monitor data","","","","","","Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; Data61","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Dhahi Al-Shammari reports financial support was provided by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation & Data61.

The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Sequence mining; Session fingerprinting; Session stitching; Web analytics","Behavioral research; Decision making; Customer analysis; Demographic data; E-commerce context; Embedding technique; Hand held device; Matching algorithm; State of the art; Web navigation; Websites","","","","","","","Kim S., Kini N., Pujara J., Koh E., Getoor L., Probabilistic visitor stitching on cross-device web logs, WWW, pp. 1581-1589, (2017); Qiao Y., Wu Y., He Y., Hao L., Lin W., Yang J., Linking user online behavior across domains with internet traffic, J.

However, many sales organizations face difficulties when implementing predictive analytics applications. This article elucidates these difficulties by developing the PSAA model—a conceptual framework that explains how predictive sales analytics (PSA) applications support sales employees’ job performance. In particular, the PSAA model conceptualizes the key contingencies governing how the availability of PSA applications translates into adoption of these applications and, ultimately, job performance. These contingencies determine the extent to which sales employees adopt these applications to revise their decision-making and the extent to which these updates improve the decision outcome. To build the PSAA model, we integrate literature on predictive analytics and machine learning, technology adoption, and marketing capabilities. In doing so, this research provides a theoretical frame for future studies on salesperson adoption and effective utilization of PSA. © 2023, The Author(s).","Advanced analytics; Machine learning; Personal selling; Predictive analytics; Sales force effectiveness; Sales management","","","","","","Ruhr-Universität Bochum, RUB","","Achrol R.S., Stern L.W., Environmental determinants of decision-making uncertainty in marketing channels, Journal of Marketing Research, 25, pp. 36-50, (1988); Agnetis A., Messina E., Pranzo M., Call planning in European pharmaceutical sales force management, IMA Journal of Management Mathematics, 21, pp. 267-280, (2010); Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction machines: The simple economics of artificial intelligence, (2018); Alavi S., Ehlig P.A., Habel J., Transformational and transactional sales leadership during a global pandemic, Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 42, pp. 324-338, (2022); Alavi S., Habel J., The human side of digital transformation in sales: Review & future paths, Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 41, pp. 83-86, (2021); Alavi S., Habel J., Linsenmayer K., What does adaptive selling mean to salespeople?

Companies increasingly use algorithms to generate predictions for marketing decisions, such as which consumers to target with which offers. Such algorithmic decision-making promises to make marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective. Not surprisingly, machine learning is a trending topic for marketing researchers and practitioners. However, machine learning also introduces important challenges to the marketing landscape. We discuss this development by outlining recent progress and future research directions of machine learning in marketing. Specifically, we provide an overview of typical machine learning applications in marketing and present a guiding framework. We position the articles in the Journal of Business Research's Special Issue on “Machine Learning in Marketing” within this framework and conclude by putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Algorithm; Machine learning; Marketing; Privacy; Research agenda","","","","","","","","Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction machines: The simple economics of artificial intelligence, (2018); Airani R., Karande K., How social media effects shape sentiments along the twitter journey?

Phenomenon such as out of stock and slow sales has been common in recent years. These issues can be managed only when the occurrence of the sales volume is predicted in advance, and sufficient warnings can be executed in time. Thus, keeping in mind the importance of the sales prediction system, the purpose of this paper is to propose an effective sales prediction model and make digital marketing strategies with the machine learning model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the consumer purchasing behavior decision theory, we discuss the factors affecting product sales, including external factors, consumer perception, consumer potential purchase behavior and consumer traffic. Then we propose a sales prediction model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, using the time-series prediction that ensures the effective prediction of sales about each product in a short time on online stores based on the sales data in the previous term or month or year. The proposed M-GNA-XGBOOST model serves as an adaptive prediction model, for which the instant factors and the sales data of the previous period are the input, and the optimal computation is based on the proposed methodology. The adaptive prediction using the proposed model is developed based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The model inherits the advantages among the algorithms with better accuracy and forecasts the sales of each product in the store with instant data characteristics for the first time. Findings: The analysis using Jingdong dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is enhanced and the accuracy that instant data as input is found to be better compared with the model that lagged data as input. The root means squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed model are found to be around 11.9 and 8.23. According to the sales prediction of each product, the resource can be arranged in advance, and the marketing strategy of product positioning, product display optimization, inventory management and product promotion is designed for online stores. Originality/value: The paper proposes and implements a new model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, to predict sales of each product for online stores. Our work provides reference and enlightenment for the establishment of accurate sales-based digital marketing strategies for online stores. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Deep learning; Integration model;

The purpose of this paper is twofold – first, to test how the addition of demographic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach – Our research employed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino’s direct marketing activities to improve the company’s RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications – The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company’s own RFM segmentation was also found to perform well. Limitations – Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models’ power. While all models developed are applicable to similar data, they could lose their accuracy when applied to data from a different industry. The company’s own RFM model was not analyzed but was included in the model as is. Further insight could be gained by determining its optimal pa-rameters. Originality – This study contributes to the existing litera-ture by showing how direct marketing efficiency modeling using standard RFM could be improved with the addition of a company’s customer property. It also provides insight into how classification algorithms perform on a casino database of direct marketing activities. © 2023, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components. It was a detailed study of the current state of brand marketing strategies and customer satisfaction, found key indicators of brands that could improve customer satisfaction, and presented corresponding suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies. It shows that. It has the importance of good guidance and references to improve customer satisfaction in the industry. © 2021","Big Data; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Factor Analysis; Machine learning; Meta-combined approach","Big data; Consumer behavior; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Finance; Philosophical aspects; Sales; Strategic planning; Surveys; Behavior evaluations; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Customer perspectives; Customers' satisfaction; Equity analysis; Factors analysis; Marketing research; Marketing strategy; Meta-combined approach; Machine learning","","","","","Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China","This work was supported by Qing Lan Project, Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence (No.CM20183002) and Major Cultivating Projects of CZIMT (2019ZDXM09).","Argyris Y.A., Wang Z., Kim Y., Yin Z., The effects of visual congruence on increasing consumers’ brand engagement: An empirical investigation of influencer marketing on instagram using deep-learning algorithms for automatic image classification, Computers in Human Behavior, 112, (2020); Cui F., Hu H., Xie Y., An intelligent optimization method of E-commerce product marketing, Neural Computing & Applications, 33, pp. 4097-4110, (2021); Ezenwafor E.C., Ayodele A.A., Chukwudi Ireneus Nwaizugbo.

E-retailers, for example, effectively use large volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business operations data to aid operations and supply chain management. Although logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions, leaving it an under-researched area of study. Adding to this research stream by exploring the case of a U.K.-based fast-fashion retailer, this article reveals unique consumer segments and links them to the revenue they are capable of generating. Applying the partitioning around medoids algorithm to three random samples of 10 000 unique consumer visits to the e-commerce site of a fast-fashion retailer, six consumer segments are identified. This article shows that although the 'mobile window shoppers' segment consists of the largest consumer segment, it attracts the lowest revenue. In contrast, 'visitors with a purpose,' although one of the smallest segments, generates the highest revenue. The findings of this article contribute to marketing research and inform practice, which can use these insights to target customer segments in a more tailored fashion.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Apparel retailing; big data; clickstream data; consumer segmentation; online purchase","Big data; Data Analytics; Electronic commerce; Machine learning; Metadata; Supply chain management; Apparel retailing; Business operation; Clickstream data; Consumer segmentation; Consumer segments; Data analytics; Large volumes; Machine-learning; Market researches; Online purchase; Sales","","","","","","","Choi T.M., Information Systems for theFashion and Apparel Industry., (2016); Bhardwaj V., Fairhurst A., Fast fashion: Response to changes in the fashion industry, Int.

This phenomenon has led to the search for more innovative UDS modes, such as drones, as they provide fast, safer, and eco-friendly services. Although researchers have examined the perceptions regarding the adoption of drone delivery, there are many unknowns about the intentions to use this futuristic delivery mode. By employing survey data obtained through an online survey conducted in Ghana, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the current UDS user profiles and investigate their intentions to adopt drone deliveries in the future, considering the lived experiences of traditional UDS usage pre/post the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding UDS user profiling, the study applied an advanced unsupervised machine learning method known as cluster correspondence analysis to simultaneously identify critical clusters in the data as well as key factor associations for each group. The findings demonstrated that most people in Ghana who seldom used the traditional UDS usually experienced poor service levels. Females living in the capital of Ghana who are frequent users of UDS mainly experienced acceptable service levels. Using an ordered probit regression model, the study identified that variables such as males, people who desired contactless UDS, and frequent UDS users at work or school during the COVID-19 pandemic were more inclined to embrace drone deliveries when introduced. Conversely, individuals who frequently used UDS services at home, those living in large cities, and those with lower income levels expressed reluctance toward drone delivery services. This study augments the urban logistics literature in LMICs by offering insightful suggestions in the areas of education, enhanced marketing strategies, and delivery optimization, which are instrumental for informing policy decisions. Government-related transportation bodies, private logistics firms, and trade unions can collaborate and adopt the recommendations provided to improve urban delivery services and to pave the way for integrating drone delivery services in the near future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Drone deliveries; Low- and middle-income country; Machine learning; Probit; Urban logistics","Ghana; Commerce; Drones; Employment; Machine learning; Marketing; Regression analysis; Delivery service; Drone delivery; Low income countries; Machine-learning; Middle-income countries; Probit; Service levels; Urban delivery; Urban logistics; User's profiles; COVID-19; decision making; developing world; epidemic; future prospect; governance approach; logistics; machine learning; pandemic; service sector; technology adoption; transportation mode; transportation policy; urban transport; COVID-19","","","","","","","Aaditya B., Rahul T.M., Psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the mode choice behaviour: a hybrid choice modelling approach, Transport Pol., 108, pp. 47-58, (2021); Abou-Zeid M., Ben-Akiva M., Hybrid choice models, Handbook of Choice Modelling, pp. 383-412, (2014); Ali S., Khalid N., Javed H.M.U., Islam D.M., Consumer adoption of online food delivery ordering (OFDO) services in Pakistan: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 7, (2020); Asante K.T., Residual Capacity and the Political Economy of Pandemic Response in Ghana, (2022); Ashifur Rahman M., Das S., Sun X., Using cluster correspondence analysis to explore rainy weather crashes in Louisiana, Transport.

State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy’s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Poor’s 500 Index data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art noninterpretable methods, based on simulation regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure. © 2020 INFORMS","approximate dynamic programming; decision trees; interpretability; optimal stopping; option pricing","Binary trees; Costs; Dynamic programming; Economics; Financial markets; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Application area; Approximate dynamic programming; Approximation problems; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Interpretability; Optimal stopping; Options pricing; Sample average approximation; State-of-the-art methods; Decision trees","","","","","Department Editor Chung Piaw Teo","The authors thank Department Editor Chung Piaw Teo, the associate editor, and three anonymous referees for thoughtful comments that have helped to improve the paper.

The current international regime for copyright protection of databases requires that compilations of data be protected “by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents [which] constitute intellectual creations"". However, Malaysia continues to follow the sweat of the brow approach to copyright protection of tables or compilations although a provision similar to TRIPS separately exists. On the other hand, Taiwan adopts a similar, but not identical approach to the TRIPS. The key differences are that Taiwan’s formulation uses the word “creativity” instead of “creation” sans“intellectual” and uses the conjunction “and” instead of “or” between selection and arrangement. The ECJ’s decision in Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo! UK Ltd in interpreting the European Database Directive emphasised that copyright protection for databases must be determined solely on the basis of the selection or arrangement but not on the creation of content. Likewise, the Fixture Marketing cases decided by the ECJ held that only the obtaining, verification or presentation of “existing independent material” matters to the sui generis database rights but not that of newly created data. It would appear that most, if not all, machine learning datasets will not satisfy the “intellectual creations” requirement and thus fail to qualify for copyright protection. Enacting a universal sui generis database protection may not be an easy solution. Perhaps, it is time for the international community to get down from the philosophical high horse and to accept that databases should be protected in copyright simply on account of the effort in their compilation, without the necessity to judge whether there is any intellectual input in the selection or arrangement of their content. © 2021","Copyright Protection of Databases; European Database Directive; Machine Learning Datasets; Malaysia; Taiwan","","","","","","Shih Hsin University","A draft version of this paper has been presented at the 2021 International Conference on the Cutting Edge Jurisprudence in the Digital Era, organised by the Shih Hsin University, Taiwan, on 18 June 2021.

However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021","Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Electric vehicles; Support vector machines; Adoption; Imputation; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Market evolution; Methodological tools; Neural-networks; Strategic decision making; Supervised machine learning; Support vectors machine; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; prediction; statistical data; supervised classification; supervised learning; technology adoption; Forecasting","","","","","","","Bas J., Cirillo C., Cherchi E., A Stated Choice Experiment for consodering Social Conformity in the adoption of Electric Vehicles, ISCTSC 2020 - The 12th International Conference on Transport Survey Methods, (2020); Berkeley N., Bailey D., Jones A., Jarvis D., Assessing the transition towards Battery Electric Vehicles: A Multi-Level Perspective on drivers of, and barriers to, take up, Transportation Research part A: policy and practice, 106, pp. 320-332, (2017); Bezdek J.C., Hathaway R.J., VAT: a tool for visual assessment of (cluster) tendency., Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCC ’02), 3, pp. 2225-2230, (2002); Bolton R.J., Hand D.J., Statistical fraud detection: a review, Stat.

As both extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of individuals are important in influencing their decision-making process, this study explores potential Chinese outbound tourists from these two aspects. Demographic and psychographic factors, as the proxy of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics, respectively, are incorporated into this study to construct the relationship between tourists' characteristics and their intentions of outbound travel. An advanced machine learning approach, called twice-learning, is employed for modelling in this study. As an intelligent data analysis tool, this method is able to construct models that can provide insight into the ground-truth relationships hidden beneath the data in an essentially comprehensible way, without being limited by the typical assumptions held by the traditional data analysis methods. By applying this method, the important personal factors that influence Chinese citizens' intentions of outbound travel are detected, and the typical groups of potential Chinese outbound tourists are characterised. The findings would be beneficial for destination marketers to develop marketing strategies on positioning and advertising which are tailored to potential Chinese outbound travel market. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","machine learning; outbound travel; personal characteristic; travel intention; twice-learning","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41171121)","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to “big data,” and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight—the soul—the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for “what-if” and “but-for” applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul. The brightest future is based on the synergy of what the machine can do well and what humans do well.

This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic use of AI. © 2020, The Author(s).","4Cs; 4Ps; Artificial intelligence; Feeling AI; Machine learning; Marketing strategy; Mechanical AI; Personalization; Positioning; Relationalization; Segmentation; Standardization; Strategic AI marketing; Targeting; Thinking AI","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","This research was supported by grants (106-2410-H-002-056-MY3 and 107–2410-H-002-115-MY3) from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

Multi-source information combination methods make it possible to depict different kinds of characteristics and features, given a limited volume of samples. Evidence theory is a common approach used for multi-source combinations. This paper proposes a new method, named ‘Multi-Evidence Dynamic Weighted Combination Forecasting (MEDWCF)’, based on improvements in the application of Evidence theory. Two kinds of machine learning methods are used to solve the basic probability assignment generation problem pertaining to Evidence theory, so a dynamic update combination algorithm is proposed. These innovations improve the classical one-step static combination rules. Samples of 313 films launched within 2016 and 2017 proved that compared with other forecasting methods, MEDWCF has more effectiveness and better generalisation ability. Effective product sales forecast by MEDWCF may help managers make correct decisions in manufacturing and marketing before the product launched. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","box office forecasts; dynamic update combination algorithm; evidence theory; machine learning; Sales forecasting","Commerce; Entertainment industry; Forecasting; Machine learning; Sales; Basic probability assignment; Combination forecasting; Combination method; Forecasting methods; Machine learning methods; Multi-source informations; Sales forecasting; Short life cycle products; Life cycle","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71672004)","This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant Number 71672004.

The purpose of this article is to show what artificial intelligence (AI) tools - expert systems - can actually be used for administrative decision in public administration. The end of the administrative decision must be justified in detail according to the legal regulations. Expert systems do this. The other large group of AI tools, solutions based on machine learning, act as black boxes, mapping input data to output data, so the reason for the solution is unknown. Therefore, these tools are not suitable for direct, administrative decision, but can support office work with expert systems.

The results of automatic learning (linear regression) with 50 %, 60 %, 70 % and 80 % of training indicate that APESP favors the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills in the educational process on the probability of events and intersection. Data science (decision tree technique) allows identifying and establishing different predictive models on the use of APESP in the teaching-learning process. Likewise, Bayes' theorem predicts the impact of APESP (contents) on the educational process of probability. Finally, APESP is an innovative technological tool that facilitates learning in the field of statistics through data simulation. © 2020 Universidade da Beira Interior.

During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known “learn-and-earn” trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser’s MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel. © 2017 INFORMS.","A/B testing; Adaptive experiments; Earning-and-learning; Explore-exploit; Field experiments; Hierarchical models; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandit; Online advertising; Reinforcement learning; Sequential decision making","","","","","","","","Agarwal D., Chen B.-C., Elango P., Explore/exploit schemes for web content optimization, (2008); Agrawal R., Sample mean based index policies with O(log n) regret for the multi-armed bandit problem, Adv.

Using 2 months of HTTP request logs from a large public university, we present an empirical study of fraud in affiliate marketing programs. First, we develop an efficient, decision-tree based technique for detecting cookie-stuffing in HTTP request logs. Our technique replicates domain-informed human labeling of the same data with 93.3% accuracy. Second, we find that over one-third of publishers in affiliate marketing programs use fraudulent cookie-stuffing techniques in an attempt to claim credit from online retailers for illicit referrals. However, most realized conversions are credited to honest publishers. Finally, we present a stake holder analysis of affiliate marketing fraud and find that the costs and rewards of affiliate marketing program are spread across all parties involved in affiliate marketing programs. © The Author 2016.","Affiliate marketing; Cybercrime; Machine learning","Crime; Decision trees; HTTP; Learning systems; Marketing; Cybercrime; Empirical studies; Marketing program; Public universities; Stake holders; Web users; Commerce","","","","","","","Edelman B., Brandi Risk W., Information, and Incentives in Online Affiliate Marketing, (2015); Dave V., Guha S., Zhang Y., Viceroi: catching click-spam in search ad networks, Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer &Communications Security, pp. 765-776, (2013); Clayton R., Mansfield T., A study of whose privacy and proxy service abuse, Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Economics of Information Security, (2014); Chachra N., McCoy D., Savage S., Et al., Empirically characterizing domain abuse and the revenue impact of blacklisting, Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Economics of Information Security, (2014); Kanich C., Kreibich C., Levchenko K., Et al., Spamalytics: An empirical analysis of spam marketing conversion, Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 3-14, (2008); Moore T., Edelman B., Measuring the perpetrators and funders of typosquatting, pp. 175-191, (2010); Chachra N., Savage S., Voelker G., Affiliate crookies: characterizing affiliate marketing abuse, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Internet Measurement Conference (to Appear), (2015); Peacock T., Friedman A., Automation and disruption in stolen payment card markets, Criminal Justice Studies, 23, pp. 33-50, (2010); Kshetri N., The economics of click fraud, IEEE Security & Privacy, 8, pp. 45-53, (2010); Khan M.T., Huo X., Li L., Et al., Every second counts: quantifying the negative externalities of cybercrime via typosquatting, Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, (2015); Schneider F., Ager B., Maier G., Pitfalls in HTTP traffic measurements and analysis, pp. 242-251, (2012); Xie G., Iliofotou M., Karagiannis T., Et al., Resurf: reconstructing websurfing activity from network traffic, pp. 1-9, (2013); Neasbitt C., Perdisci R., Li K., Et al., ClickMiner: towards forensic reconstruction of user-browser interactions from network traces,, Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, (2014); Khan M.T., Kanich C., High fidelity, high risk, high reward: using highfidelity networking data in ethically sound research, Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMMWorkshop on Ethics in Networked Systems, (2015); Referrer Policy-W3C First Public Working Draft; Xie G., Iliofotou M., Karagiannis T., Et al., Resurf: reconstructing web-surfing activity fromnetwork traffic, pp. 1-9, (2013); Wayne Porter.

The literature has introduced the individual-level and the segment-based predictive modeling approaches for this purpose. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and performs in certain cases. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach which predicts customers’ individual purchase behaviors and reduces the limitations of these two methods by combining the advantages of them. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hybrid approach is established based on individual-level and segment-based approaches and utilizes the historical transactional data and predictive algorithms to generate predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in the domain of supermarket shopping by using real-world data and using five popular machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests. Findings: A comparison of results shows that the proposed hybrid approach substantially outperforms the individual-level and the segment-based approaches in terms of prediction coverage while maintaining roughly comparable prediction accuracy to the individual-level method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that logistic regression performs better than the other classifiers in predicting customer purchase behavior. Practical implications: The study concludes that the proposed approach would be beneficial for enterprises in terms of designing customized services and one-to-one marketing strategies. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to adopt a hybrid approach combining individual-level and segment-based approaches to predict customers’ individual purchase behaviors. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer behavior models;

In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk. A case study of a mobile communication company is also presented to explain the proposed procedure, as well as to analyze its real performance and results. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

The sample is composed of 106 students from the careers of Administration, Commerce, Accounting, Marketing and Systems. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that audiovisual contents, discussion forums and online evaluations in the blended learning modality positively influence the teaching-learning process. On the other hand, data science identified 3 predictive models on the use of Blended learning by means of the decision tree technique. This research recommends the incorporation of the Blended learning modality during the planning and organization of school courses in order to develop the competencies of the students. Finally, Blended learning represents an alternative to improve teaching-learning conditions in the 21st century through the performance of synchronous and asynchronous school activities. © 2020 Red Universitaria de Campus Virtuales.

Second, it examines if there exists a complementary (substitute) relation in terms of firms' preference between four types of innovation. Studying 1500 firms of seven developing economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a machine learning-based regression, to identify key predictors likely to influence firms' R&D propensity and intensity. Estimating the knowledge function, we found-in line with LASSO-that medium-sized firms, human capital (training) and credit facilities favorably affect firms' decision to invest in R&D. Contrarily, the impact is adverse if the first or main product generates firms' large share of revenue, a unique finding not captured by previous studies. The marginal effects of four univariate probit models indicate that firms' investment in R&D translates into innovation. However, the application of the Geweke-Hajivassiliour-Keane (GHK)-simulator based multivariate probit, which considers simultaneity of firms' innovation decisions that univariate probit ignores, suggests that the relationship between different types of innovation is complementary. Firms' strategy to adopt a particular type of innovation is influenced by other types. This led to the estimation of R&D's impact on technological and nontechnological innovation, which shows that while firms innovate both types, there is a skewed link between nontechnological innovation and the services sector. © 2020 by the author.","LASSO; Multivariate probit; Nontechnological innovation; R & D; Technological innovation; Tobit","economic conditions; firm size; innovation; multivariate analysis; research and development; service sector","","","","","Enterprise Survey Unit of World Bank","This research received no external funding.

The purpose of this paper is to develop understanding of consumers online-generated contents in terms of positive or negative comments to increase marketing intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: The research focuses on the collection of 9,652 tweets referring to three fast fashion retailers of different sizes operating in the UK market, which have been shared among consumers and between consumer and firm, and subsequently evaluated through a sentiment analysis based on machine learning. Findings: Findings provide the comparison and contrast of consumers’ response toward the different retailers, while providing useful guidelines to systematically making sense of consumers’ tweets and enhancing marketing intelligence. Practical implications: The research provides an effective and systemic approach to accessing the rich data set on consumers’ experiences based the massive number of contents that consumers generate and share online and investigating this massive amount of data to achieve insights able to impact on retailers’ marketing intelligence. Originality/value: To best of the authors’ knowledge, while other authors tried to identify the effect of positive or negative online comments/posts/reviews, the present study is the first one to show how to systematically detect the positive or negative sentiments of shared tweets for improving the marketing intelligence of fast fashion retailers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big Data analytics; Consumer-generated contents; E-word of mouth communication; Fast fashion; Online consumer behaviour; User-generated contents (UGC)","","","","","","","","Barnes L., Lea-Greenwood G., Fast fashion in the retail store environment, International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management, 38, 10, pp. 760-772, (2010); Baum D., Spann M., The interplay between online consumer reviews and recommender systems: an experimental analysis, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 19, 1, pp. 129-162, (2014); Bilotta E., Pantano P., Artificial micro worlds part IV: models of complex self-reproducers, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 21, 6, pp. 1501-1521, (2011); Bradlow E.T., Gangwar M., Kopalle P., Voleti S., The role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing, Journal of Retailing, 93, 1, pp. 79-95, (2017); Chang S.W., Fan S.H., Cultivating the brand-customer relationship in Facebook fan pages: a study of fast-fashion industry, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 45, 3, pp. 253-270, (2017); Choi T.M., Hui C.L., Liu N., Ng S.F., Yu Y., Fast fashion sales forecasting with limited data and time, Decision Support Systems, 59, pp. 84-92, (2014); Chonacky N., Winch D., Maple, mathematics and Matlab: the 3M’s without the tape, Computing in Science and Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 8-16, (2005); Chong A.Y.L., Chang E., Liu M.J., Li B., Predicting consumer product demands via Big Data: the roles of online promotional marketing and online reviews, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 17, pp. 5142-5156, (2017); Cook S.C., Yurchisin J., Fast fashion environments: consumer’s heaven or retailer’s nightmare?, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 45, 2, pp. 143-157, (2017); Demmers J., Van Dolen W.M., Weltevreden J.W., Handling consumer messages on social networking sites: customer service or privacy infringement?, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 22, 1, pp. 8-35, (2018); Dindar M., Yaman N.D., #IUseTwitterBecause: content analytic study of a trending topic in Twitter, Information Technology and People, 31, 1, pp. 256-277, (2018); Ellonen H.-K., Wikstrom P., Jantunen A., Linking dynamic-capabilities portfolios and innovation outcomes, Technovation, 29, 11, pp. 753-762, (2009); Erkan I., Evans C., The influence of eWOM in social media on consumers’ purchase intentions: an extended approach to information adoption, Computers in Human Behavior, 61, pp. 47-55, (2016); Ersoy M., Akbulut Y., Cognitive and affective implications of persuasive technology use on mathematics instruction, Computers and Education, 75, pp. 253-262, (2014); Fan S., Lau R.Y., Zhao J.L., Demystifying Big Data analytics for business intelligence through the lens of marketing mix, Big Data Research, 2, 1, pp. 28-32, (2015); Fleisher C.S., Using open source data in developing competitive and marketing intelligence, European Journal of Marketing, 42, 7-8, pp. 852-866, (2008); Gensler S., Volckner F., Egger M., Fischbach K., Schoder D., Listen to your customers: insights into brand image using online consumer-generated product reviews, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 20, 81, pp. 112-141, (2015); Ghiassi M., Lee S., A domain transferable lexicon set for Twitter sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 106, pp. 197-216, (2018); Halvorsen K., Hoffmann J., Coste-Maniere I., Stankeviciute R., Can fashion blog function as a marketing tool to influence consumer behavior?

The aim of the multi decision tree (MDT) is to improve decision tree classifier. The performances of MDT are compared with C4.5 decision tree algorithm and some ensemble of decision tree classifiers, namely bagging decision tree, boosting decision trees (BDT) and random forests decision tree. Results show substantial improvements when compared to these approaches.

To model consumer responses to direct marketing, this study proposes Bayesian networks learned by evolutionary programming. Using a large direct marketing data set, we tested the endogeneity bias in the recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) variables using the control function approach; compared the results of Bayesian networks with those of neural networks, classification and regression tree (CART), and latent class regression; and applied a tenfold cross-validation. The results suggest that Bayesian networks have distinct advantages over the other methods in accuracy of prediction, transparency of procedures, interpretability of results, and explanatory insight. Our findings lend strong support to Bayesian networks as a robust tool for modeling consumer response and other marketing problems and for assisting management decision making. © 2006 INFORMS.","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Direct marketing; Evolutionary programming; Machine learning","Behavioral research; Computer programming; Data mining; Database systems; Learning systems; Management; Marketing; Networks (circuits); Tools; Bayesian networks; Direct marketing; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Leone R.P., Jen L., A dynamic model of purchase timing with application to direct marketing, J.

In this publication, we propose a new approach to determining reserve-price strategies for publishers, focusing not only on the profits from individual ad impressions, but also on maximum coverage of advertising space. This strategy combines the heuristics developed by experienced RTB consultants with machine learning forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet. The paper analyses the effectiveness of these algorithms, recommends the best one, and presents its implementation in real environment. As such, its results may form a basis for a competitive advantage for publishers on very demanding online advertising markets.  © 2020 Andrzej Wodecki, published by Sciendo 2020.","forecasting; machine learning; online marketing; real-time bidding; reserve price optimization","","","","","","","","Ad Exchange Historical Report-Google Ad Manager Help, (2020); Autoregressive integrated moving average, Wikipedia, (2020); Exponential smoothing, Wikipedia, (2020); Prophet, (2020); Prophet Diagnostics, (2020); Austin A., Barnard J., Hutcheon N., Programmatic Marketing Forecasts 2019, (2019); Austin D., Seljan S., Monello J., Tzeng S., Reserve Price Optimization at Scale, 2016 Ieee International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), pp. 528-536, (2016); Brownlee J., Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting, (2018); Brownlee J., Introduction to Time Series Forecasting in Python, (2018); Chapman P., Clinton J., Kerber R., Khabaza T., Reinartz T., Shearer C., Wirth R., CRISP-DM 1.0, (2004); Choi H., Mela C.F., Balseiro S., Leary A., Online Display Advertising Markets: A Literature Review and Future Directions, Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2019); Hipel K.W., McLeod A.I., Chapter 12 Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models, Developments in Water Science, pp. 419-462, (1994); Li J., Ni X., Yuan Y., The Reserve Price of Ad Impressions in Multi-Channel Real-Time Bidding Markets, Ieee Transactions on Computational Social Systems, 5, 2, pp. 583-592, (2018); Li J., Ni X., Yuan Y., Qin R., Wang X., Wang F.-Y., The Impact of Reserve Price on Publisher Revenue in Real-time Bidding Advertising Markets, pp. 1256-1261, (2017); Lu J., Yang C., Gao X., Wang L., Li C., Chen G., Reinforcement Learning with Sequential Information Clustering in Real-Time Bidding, pp. 1633-1641, (2019); Makridakis S., Spiliotis E., Assimakopoulos V., Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods: Concerns and ways forward, Plos One, 13, 3, (2018); Myerson R.B., Optimal Auction Design, Mathematics of Operations Research, 6, 1, pp. 58-73, (1981); Radovanovic A., Heavlin W.D., Riskaware Revenue Maximization in Display Advertising, pp. 91-100, (2012); Ren K., Qin J., Zheng L., Yang Z., Zhang W., Yu Y., Deep Landscape Forecasting for Real-time Bidding Advertising, pp. 363-372, (2019); Riley J.G., Samuelson W.F., Optimal Auctions, The American Economic Review, 71, 3, pp. 381-392, (1981); Wang J., Zhang W., Yuan S., Display Advertising with Real-Time Bidding (RTB) and Behavioural Targeting, (2017); Wang Y., Ren K., Zhang W., Wang J., Yu Y., Functional Bid Landscape Forecasting for Display Advertising, pp. 115-131, (2016); Wu W., Yeh M.-Y., Chen M.-S., Deep Censored Learning of the Winning Price in the Real Time Bidding, pp. 2526-2535, (2018); Wu W.C.-H., Yeh M.-Y., Chen M.-S., Predicting Winning Price in Real Time Bidding with Censored Data, pp. 1305-1314, (2015); Yang C., Lu J., Gao X., Liu H., Chen Q., Liu G., Chen G., MoTiAC: Multi-Objective Actor-Critics for Real-Time Bidding, (2020)","","","Sciendo","","","","","","20807279","","","","English","Found.

This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules for personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique for personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.","Decision-tree induction; Internet advertising; Internet store-front; Machine learning; Personalization","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Arning A., Bollinger T., Mehta M., Schafer J., Srikant R., The quest data mining system, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining, pp. 244-249, (1996); Allen C., Kania D., Yaeckel B., Internet World Guide to One-to-One Web Marketing, (1998); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G., Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support; Broadvision.

Content preferences are defined over latent topics that describe the content of search queries and search result descriptions. Compared with existing applications of topic modeling in marketing and recommendation systems, our proposed approach can simultaneously capture multiple types of information and investigate multiple aspects of behavioral dynamics in a single framework that enables interpretable results for business decision making. To facilitate efficient and scalable inference, we develop a full Bayesian variational inference algorithm. We evaluate our modeling framework using real-world search data for TV shows from the Bing search engine. We illustrate how our model can quantify the content preferences associated with each query and how these preferences vary systematically based on whether the query is observed before, during, or after a TV show is aired. We also show that our model can help the search engine improve its ranking of search results as well as address the cold-start problem for new page links.

Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer information; Customer lifetime value;

The main body of this research is characterised by the proposal of a brand new and complete methodology for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), to be applied in marketing causal modelling and with utilities to be used as a marketing management decision support tool. Such methodology is based on Genetic Fuzzy Systems, a specific hybridization of artificial intelligence methods, highly suited to the research problem we face. The use of KDD methodologies based on intelligent systems like this can be considered as an avant-garde evolution, exponent nowadays of the so-called knowledge-based Marketing Management Support Systems; we name them as Marketing Intelligent Systems. The most important questions to the KDD process-i.e. pre-processing; machine learning and post-processing-are discussed in depth and solved. After its theoretical presentation, we empirically experiment with it, using a consumer behaviour model of reference. In this part of the paper, we try to offer an overall perspective of how it works. The valuation of its performance and utility is very positive. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts. Experiments are carried out with a dataset from one of the top streaming service companies, and results display overall better performance compared to various standalone methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Embeddings; Gradient boosting decision tree; Popularity prediction; Streaming service","Cost reduction; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; E-learning; Forecasting; IPTV; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Video recording; Video streaming; Categorical variables; Historical data; Historical view; Hybrid machine learning; Online video streaming; Popularity predictions; Streaming service; Video contents; artificial neural network; comparative study; data set; Internet; machine learning; marketing; performance assessment; prediction; Learning systems","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2017-0-00705); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government( MSIP ) (No. 2017-0-00705 , Development of Media Streaming system with Machine Learning using QoE(Quality of Experience)) ","Bartlett P.L., Hazan E., Rakhlin A., Adaptive online gradient descent, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 65-72, (2007); Chen F., Zhang C., Wang F., Liu J., Wang X., Liu Y., Cloud-assisted live streaming for crowdsourced multimedia content, IEEE Trans Multimedia, 17, 9, pp. 1471-1483, (2015); Chen J., Chen C., Using particle swarm optimization algorithm in multimedia cdn content placement, 2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, pp. 45-51, (2012); Chen L., Zhou Y., Chiu D.M., Smart streaming for online video services, IEEE Trans.

Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Canary islands; Customer satisfaction; Hotel; Machine learning; Market segmentation; Multi-criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preferences analysis","Canary Islands; Spain; hotel industry; Internet; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; preference behavior; tourist behavior","","","","","","","Agha M.S., Alnahhal M.J., Agha S.R., Alafeefy A.S., Industrial sectors eligibility for rehabilitation programs: an integrated AHP – TODIM approach, Int.

The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Green hotels; Machine learning techniques; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neuro-fuzzy; Satisfaction; Sustainable development; TOPSIS","Malaysia; cluster analysis; data mining; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; service quality; sustainable development; World Wide Web","","","","","Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, (LYC18-02, Xq18A01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771156, 71971145)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71771156 and 71971145, and the 2018 Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, grant number Xq18A01 and LYC18-02","Rahman I., Reynolds D., The influence of values and attitudes on green consumer behavior: A conceptual model of green hotel patronage, Int.

This article focuses on portfolio construction using machine learning. Historically, algorithmic trading could be more narrowly defined as the automation of sell-side trade execution, but since the introduction of more advanced algorithms, the definition has grown to include idea generation, alpha factor design, asset allocation, position sizing, and the testing of strategies.

In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","LAI; Machine learning; NDVI; NDWI; Satellite remote sensing; Vineyard yield","","","","","","","","Afghanistan Central Statistics Organization, Centeral statistics organization of Afghanistan's statistical yearbook of 2018-2019, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan National Statistics and Information Authority, Kabul Afghanistan, 41, (2019); Aich V., Akhundzadah N.A., Knuerr A., Khoshbeen A.J., Hattermann F., Paeth H., Scanlon A., Paton E.N., Climate change in Afghanistan deduced from reanalysis and coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (cordex)—south Asia simulations, J.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the attributes usually referred to the characteristics of wheat flour known to consumers and at implementing a predictive model of purchasing that allows to make correct decisions without the necessary experience of a real human expert. Design/methodology/approach: In order to investigate the research aims of the paper, an online survey was carried out and conducted by means of the Google Forms in the detection time January-April 2016. The online survey collected responses from 467 Italian respondents asked to give feedback about their buying habits of various types of flour. The responses were analyzed through a data mining approach. This paper implements predictive analytics to create a statistical model of future behavior by means of a machine learning algorithms. Findings: In line with recent healthy and dynamic trends in the food industry, conscious consumer seems to be willing to pay a price for “type 1” wheat flour that is four times higher than the price related to the basic types of wheat flour. Social implications: Consumer seems not to know well the “type 1” wheat flour and its healthy characteristics; then, it should be crucial to implement promotional strategies and marketing hand in hand. Promotion can be a key element in putting across the health benefits of special kinds of wheat flour. Originality/value: Highlighting health issues about the “type 1” wheat flour gives insights and sheds some light on the crucial need of changing eating and purchasing behavior.

Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method with several other classifiers used in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the ROC curve and geometric mean. © 2016","Ensemble;

This has led to new insights into persuasive message design. In general, persuasive advertisement messaging can be viewed as a combination of context, i.e., a message, and additional affiliated components such as images, video, and special graphics. It is composed out of two main attribute categorizations: (1) textual content such as a product description or affiliated message and (2) sensible content such as product image, color, or even scent. In a competitive market in which consumers are constantly exposed to a hyper-abundance of products that also contain sensible attributes, it is crucial to design persuasive messages that will maximally appeal to desired consumers and evoke their positive response. Yet only a few studies have focused on the effective design of persuasive advertisement messages characterized by two integrated elements. As such, this research focuses on effective persuasive message design with integrated product scent and color attributes. We demonstrate how a machine learning process can be utilized to generate optimal persuasive messages by estimating the contribution of each message attribute to the final class attribute: the purchase intention response. Our results show that several prediction algorithms can enhance consumer response value. In addition, correlations between several attributes affiliated with the message can be derived by graph theory-based estimation. This research thus provides insight into attribute values important for management decisions, with implications for effective persuasive message design. Ultimately, this may lead to higher response rates for marketing practitioners in an increasingly competitive market. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Advertising; Machine learning; Product design; Symbolic design","","","","","","","","Alriksson S., Oberg T., Conjoint analysis for environmental evaluation, Environ.

And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the ""winning model"" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the ""legwork"" of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e.g., the ""back-and-forth"" migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e.g., the inclusion of an ""off"" state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general ""recipe"" for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework). © 2014 INFORMS.","Business intelligence; Classification tree; Data science; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Hierarchical Bayesian methods; Machine learning; Model selection; Posterior predictive model checking; Random forest","","","","","","","","Bladt M., Neuts M.F., Matrix-exponential distributions: Calculus and interpretations via flows, Stochastic Models, 19, 1, pp. 113-124, (2003); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learn., 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Breiman L., Statistical modeling: The two cultures, Statist.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners’ marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers’ decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Prediction; Restaurant reviews; Review helpfulness","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., Online review helpfulness: role of qualitative factors, Psychology and Marketing, 33, 11, pp. 1006-1017, (2016); Ahani A., Nilashi M., Ibrahim O., Sanzogni L., Weaven S., Market segmentation and travel choice prediction in spa hotels through TripAdvisor’s online reviews, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 80, pp. 52-77, (2019); Antonio N., de Almeida A.M., Nunes L., Batista F., Ribeiro R., Hotel online reviews: creating a multi-source aggregated index, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 12, pp. 3574-3591, (2018); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Banerjee S., Bhattacharyya S., Bose I., Whose online reviews to trust?

Especially in the marketing field, in fact, many companies try to employ customer segmentation for the services customization which leads to increase customer loyalty and to keep high customer retention. One of the well-known approaches for the customer analysis based on purchase history data is the RFM analysis. The RFM analysis is usually used to segment customers into several groups by using three variables; how long it has been since their last purchase, how many times they purchased, and how much they spent. However, the conventional method of the RFM analysis did not assume a generative model. Therefore, when applying to an actual data set and scoring each index of R, F, M scores, several problems occur. The main problem is that an analyst should arbitrarily decide the threshold for the scores of RFM. On the other hand, in the field of machine learning, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis is widely used for soft clustering. The latent class model enables us to cluster customers into latent classes and to calculate the assignment probabilities of each customer to each latent class. In this paper, we propose a new latent class model for the RFM analysis based on the purchase history data. The proposed model enables to decide the scoring of RFM and segment customers automatically, and the soft clustering approach helps the interpretation of the result. Furthermore, the proposed model takes account of the generation model of RFM scores. From the result of actual data analysis, it became clear that it is possible to extract latent classes that express the statistical characteristics of data well. Given a generative model estimated from the given data, it is also possible to predict future purchase behaviors of customers or to generate virtual data for simulation analysis and make decisions based on the result. We verify the effectiveness of our model by analyzing a real purchase history data of a Japanese major retail company. © 2020 KIIE","Latent Class Model; Marketing Segmentation; RFM Analysis","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (26282090, 26560167); Waseda University","The authors wish to acknowledge all members of Goto Laboratory, Waseda University, and the Joint Association Study Group of Management Science for their support of our research.

Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms.

By using the developed formal model and the performed critical analysis of methods and technologies for predicting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency, we have built a general architecture of the content processing system that acquires data from different cryptocurrency Internet stock exchanges. General functional requirements to the intelligent cryptocurrency system that target the Internet users have been stated. We have investigated methods, models, and tools to improve the effective support for developing structural elements in the model of a decision support system that manages content according to the user's needs. general architectures of the backend and frontend parts of an intelligent cryptocurrency system have been devised. We also developed software for the system of integration and generation of content considering the cryptocurrency needs of users. An analysis of results of experimental verification of the proposed method for content integration and generation taking into consideration the cryptocurrency needs of users has been performed. A special feature of the system is that it analyzes information from social media and builds a forecast of currency rates based on the acquired information. A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate. The focus of the system is on the frequency of updates at the speed of data aggregation from the Internet stock exchanges and social networks. © 2019, V. Lytvyn, V. Vysotska, V. Kuchkovskiy, I.

Researchers have explored different aspects of online reviews and the characteristics of reviewers using various methods; however, few studies have focused on consumers who do not post online reviews after purchasing, resulting in a gap in the research. This study aims to identify consumers’ characteristics and analyze the importance of consumers in different online review scenarios. We employed a fusion analysis framework, which used machine learning to determine the value of different types of consumers; in addition, we quantitatively estimate the relationship between variables and consumer types using econometrics modelling. This research used real consumer data from three data resources, solving problems related to the use of limited questionnaire datasets and single-source data. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that lurkers are more valuable than posters because they can be easily served and create more profit; thus, researchers should consider those who do not post online reviews rather than focusing only on the influence of online reviews and posters. Our findings also provide managerial implications for precision marketing by indicating that e-marketers should employ various marketing strategies and pay attention to different types of consumers, especially lurkers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer characteristics; E-commerce; fusion analysis; Online review scenarios; precision marketing","Commerce; Statistics; Analysis frameworks; Data resources; Decisions makings; Managerial implications; Marketing strategy; Online reviews; Precision marketings; Rigorous analysis; article; attention; consumer; human; human experiment; machine learning; marketing; problem solving; profit; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; Marketing","","","","","Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Chinese Universities, (14JJD870002); Ministry of Education Project of key research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Chinese Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71874126); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE","Funding text 1: This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 71874126) and the Ministry of Education Project of key research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Chinese Universities (No: 14JJD870002).

Making use of this data is commonly done with machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost. This knowledge permits a company to focus marketing efforts on such clients as early as three months in advance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Client retention; Machine learning; Prepaid unitary services; Sales forecasting","corporate strategy; data set; experimental study; forecasting method; industrial performance; machine learning","","","","","","","Ali O.G., Ariturk U., Dynamic churn prediction framework with more effective use of rare event data: the case of private banking, Expert Syst.

We articulate the key managerial takeaways based on testing a multi-stage behavioral framework that links decision context, metrics selection, and performance outcomes. Our statistical model adjusts for potential endogeneity bias in estimating metric effectiveness due to selection effects and differs from past literature in that managers can strategically choose metrics based on their ex-ante expected effectiveness. The key findings of our analysis of 439 managers making 1287 decisions are that customer-mindset marketing metrics such as awareness and willingness to recommend are the most effective metrics for managers to employ while financial metrics such as target volume and net present value are the least effective. However, relative to financial metrics, managers are more uncertain about the ex-ante effectiveness of customer-mindset marketing metrics, which attenuates their use. A second study on 142 managers helps provide detailed underlying rationale for these key results. The implications of metric effectiveness for dashboards and automated decision systems based on machine learning systems are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Endogenous regression; Hierarchical Bayes; Managerial decision-making; Metric effectiveness; Rational expectations","","","","","","AMA ART Forum, Hebrew University; HEC Paris; Tulane University; University of Alabama, UA; Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","The authors thank the UCI Paul Merage School of Business Dean's Office for financial support and seminar participants at the AMA ART Forum, Hebrew University, HEC Paris, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Tulane University, and University of Alabama for their useful feedback.

One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model. © 2017 INFORMS.","Conjoint analysis; Multimodal continuous heterogeneity; Sparse machine learning","","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Rossi P.E., Marketing models of consumer heterogeneity, J.

Many regulatory and ethical issues should be considered. Some relevant EU provisions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, are applicable. However, the regulatory framework for developing and marketing a new health technology implementing ML may be quite complex. Other issues include the legal liability and the attribution of negligence in case of errors. Some of the above-mentioned concerns could be, at least partially, resolved in case the ML software is classified as a 'medical device', a category covered by EU/national provisions. Concluding, the challenge is to understand how sustainable is the regulatory system in relation to the ML innovation and how legal procedures should be revised in order to adapt them to the current regulatory framework. © 2020 Copyright 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","artificial intelligence;

Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-ofconjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machinelearning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles. The article closes with an illustration of how DOC-based rules can affect managerial decisions. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Cognitive simplicity; Conjoint analysis; Consideration sets; Consumer heuristics;

In addition, customer profitability accounting (CPA) recommends evaluating the CRM program through the combination of partial measures in a global costĝ€""benefit function. Several statistical techniques have been applied for market segmentations although the existence of large data sets reduces their effectiveness. As an alternative, decision trees are machine learning models that do not consider a priori hypotheses, achieve a high performance, and generate logical rules clearly understood by managers. In this article, a three-stage methodology is proposed that combines marketing feature selection, customer segmentation through univariate and oblique decision trees, and a new CPA function based on marketing, data warehousing, and opportunity costs linked to the analysis of different scenarios. This proposal is applied to a large insurance marketing data set for alternative cost and price conditions showing the superiority of univariate decision trees over statistical techniques. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Artificial intelligence; Costĝ€""benefit analysis; Customer profitability accounting; Customer relationship management; Marketing","","","","","","","","Anderberg M.R., Cluster Analysis for Applications, (1973); Bass F.M., Tigert D.G., Lonsdale R.T., Market segmentation: Group versus individual behaviour, Journal of Marketing Research, 5, pp. 264-270, (1968); Berger P.D., Nasr N., Customer lifetime value: Marketing models and applications, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 12, pp. 17-30, (1998); Blum A., Langley P., Selection of relevant features and examples in machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, 97, pp. 245-271, (1997); Bouwens J., Abernethy M.A., The consequences of customisation on management accounting system design, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 25, pp. 221-241, (2000); Breiman L., Friedman J.H., Olshen R.A., Stone C.J., Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Brijs T., Retail Market Basket Analysis: A Quantitative Modelling Approach, (2002); Cooper R., Kaplan R.S., Measure cost right: Make the right decision, Harvard Business Review, pp. 96-103, (1988); Davila T., An empirical study on drivers of management control systems' design in new product development, Accounting, Organization and Society, 25, pp. 383-409, (2002); Dibb S., Stern P., Questioning the reliability of market segmentation techniques, Omega, 23, pp. 625-636, (1995); Doyle P., Saunders J., Market segmentation and positioning in specialized industrial markets, Journal of Marketing, 49, pp. 24-32, (1985); Foster G., Gupta M., Marketing, cost management and management accounting, Journal of Management Accounting Research, 6, pp. 43-77, (1994); Gath I., Geva A.B., Unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 11, 7, pp. 773-781, (1988); Gerdin J., Greve J., Forms of contingency fit in management accounting research: A critical review, Accounting, Organization and Society, 29, pp. 303-326, (2004); Green P.E., Wind Y., New ways to measure consumers' judgements, Harvard Business Review, 53, pp. 107-117, (1975); Green P.E., A new approach to market segmentation, Business Horizons, 20, pp. 61-73, (1977); Guilding C., McManus L., The incidence, perceived merit and antecedents of customer accounting: An exploratory note, Accounting, Organization and Society, 27, pp. 45-59, (2002); He Z., Xu X., Huang J.Z., Deng S., Mining class outliers: Concepts, algorithms and applications in CRM, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, pp. 681-697, (2004); Heath D., Kasif S., Salzberg S., August-September).

Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm’s offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term. Complexity academic level: This case could work well as part of an executive education course, as well as a strategic management course for master’s degree or Master of Business Administration students.

Researchers have adopted various methods including statistical models and machine learning methods such as neural networks to assist decision making in direct marketing. However, due to the different performance criteria and validation techniques currently in practice, comparing different methods is often not straightforward. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the performance of neural networks with that of classification and regression tree, latent class models and logistic regression using three criteria - simple error rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and cumulative lift - and two validation methods, i.e. bootstrap and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Systematic experiments are conducted to compare their performance. Findings - The results suggest that these methods vary in performance across different criteria and validation methods. Overall, neural networks outperform the others in AUROC value and cumulative lifts, and the stratified ten-fold cross-validation produces more accurate results than bootstrap validation. Practical implications - To select predictive models to support direct marketing decisions, researchers need to adopt appropriate performance criteria and validation procedures. Originality/value - The study addresses the key issues in model selection, i.e. performance criteria and validation methods, and conducts systematic analyses to generate the findings and practical implications.","Database marketing; Direct marketing; Modelling; Neural nets; Performance criteria","","","","","","","","Adams N.M., Hand D.J., Improving the practice of classifier performance assessment, Neural Computation, 12, 2, pp. 305-311, (2000); Baesens B., Viaene S., van den Poel D., Vanthienen J., Dedene G., Bayesian neural network learning for repeat purchase modelling in direct marketing, European Journal of Operational Research, 138, 1, pp. 191-211, (2002); Baesens B., van Gestel T., Viaene S., Stepanova M., Suykens J., Vanthienen J., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 6, pp. 627-635, (2003); Berardi V.L., Zhang G.P., The effect of misclassification costs on neural network classifiers, Decision Sciences, 30, 3, pp. 659-682, (1999); Berger P., Magliozzi T., The effect of sample size and proportion of buyers in the sample on the performance of list segmentation equations generated by regression analysis, Journal of Direct Marketing, 6, 1, pp. 13-22, (1992); Bhattacharyva S., Direct marketing performance modeling using genetic algorithms, INFORMS Journal on Computing, 11, 3, pp. 2248-2257, (1999); Cooil B., Winer R.S., Rados D.L., Cross-validation for prediction, Journal of Marketing Research, 24, 3, pp. 271-279, (1987); Cui G., Wong M.L., Implementing neural networks for decision support in direct marketing, International Journal of Market Research, 46, 2, pp. 235-254, (2004); Efron B., Tibshirani R., An Introduction to the Bootstrap, (1993); Efron B., Tibshirani R., Improvements on cross-validation: The. 632+ bootstrap method, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 92, 438, pp. 548-560, (1997); Ho Y.-C., Pepyne D.L., Simple explanation of the no free lunch theorem of optimization, Cybernetics and Systems Analysis, 38, 2, pp. 292-298, (2002); Jain D., Bass F.M., Chen Y.-M., Estimation of latent class models with heterogeneous choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 27, 1, pp. 94-101, (1990); Kohavi R., A study of cross-validation and bootstrap for accuracy estimation and model selection, Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Joint Conference on AI, Montreal, (1995); Malthouse E.C., Assessing the performance of direct marketing scoring models, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 15, 1, pp. 49-62, (2001); Mitchell T., Machine Learning, (1997); Neal R.M., Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks, (1996); Peacock P.R., Data mining in marketing.

The data obtained from these sites are analysed for better human decision making. Sentiment analysis involves extraction of sentiments from reviews. Sentiments can be positive, negative or neutral. Most of the content on the internet is in the English language, but with the improved awareness of people, data in other languages is increasing gradually. Not much work has been done in Indian languages. Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English, is an informal language which is exceptionally famous in India as individuals feel greater talking in their language. In this paper, we present a dictionary-based approach for Hinglish text classification. We also implemented traditional machine learning classification algorithms such as SVM, NB and ME for comparison. It is found that for Hinglish text, dictionary-based classification gives best accuracy results.

Recent advances in this form of artificial intelligence has been suggested to allow content creators and managers to transcend their tasks from creation towards editing, thus overcoming a common problem: the tyranny of the blank screen. In this research, we address this topic by proposing a novel system design that will suggest engagement-driven message features as well as automatically generate critical and fully written unique Tweet message components for the goal of maximizing the probability of relatively high engagement levels. Our multi-methods design relies on the use of econometrics, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics, all of which are widely used in the emerging fields of Business and Marketing Analytics. Our system design is intended to analyze Tweet messages for the purpose of generating the most critical components and structure of Tweets. We propose econometric models to judge the quality of written Tweets by way of engagement-level prediction, as well as a generative probability model for the auto-generation of Tweet messages. Testing of our design demonstrates the need to take into account the contextual, semantic, and syntactic features of messages, while controlling for individual user characteristics, so that generated Tweet components and structure maximizes the potential engagement levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian statistics; Business analytics; Marketing analytics; Natural language generation; Tweet generation; Tweet suggestion","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Economics; Managers; Semantics; Statistics; Systems analysis; Bayesian statistics; Component generation; Critical component; Econometric model; Engagement levels; Probability modeling; Syntactic features; User characteristics; Structural design","","","","","","","Zadeh A.H., Sharda R., Modeling brand post popularity dynamics in online social networks, Decis.

The visible light communication channel model is constructed, and a fusion length limited coding mode is set to make the signal transmitted by visible light communication more in line with the overall response of the channel. The decision feedback equalizer is selected as the equalizer, and the channel cascade impulse response condition is set to compensate the distorted output of the channel. The blind equalization algorithm is designed to classify the data by unsupervised learning, and the extreme point of the error function is found through iterative calculation to optimize the equalizer. The simulation results show that under the same SNR test conditions, the bit error rate of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the blind equalization algorithm based on LMS and BP neural network. Under the condition of SNR = 20dB, the bit error rate is significantly reduced to the order of 10-5, with high communication quality. The VLC system uses an LED backlight display with a CMOS camera. In general, this panel is used to display marketing information. By adjusting the brightness of the CMOS camera's rolling shutter effect (RSE), additional data, such as dynamic content, may be wirelessly sent. NR (noise to signal) ratio of VLC can't keep up with the variety of material being shown on the screen. It is possible to significantly enhance the CMOS RSE pattern decomposition by using a grayscale value distribution (GVD) and a machine learning method (MLA). © 2021 ThinkBiotech LLC.

Methodology: Time series of daily sales between the years 2017 and 2019 of 10 retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector were considered. Methods based on machine learning were used and the forecasting models were increased with numerical variables from the official profile of the company, from the posting made by the contracted digital influencer and the characteristics of the images posted by the digital influencer were included in the models. Relevance and Originality: The study is innovative, as it goes beyond qualitative reflections on the theme and provides empirical evidence regarding the impacts on forecast accuracy from the inclusion of social media variables. A data fusion strategy (numerics and images) was also presented to forecast daily sales of retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Main results: The models proved to be efficient in forecasting and the importance of the likes and engagement variables reinforces the idea that the identification and social reference generated by the ID are important aspects in the purchase decision process. It was found that the images are responsible for adding exclusive attributes that help in forecasting and understanding the patterns of the sales series. Theoretical and methodological contributions:The study showed in a promising way the efficiency of methods based on machine learning in forecasting sales from Instagram data, especially with regard to the incorporation and extraction of image data. © 2021 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior. To reach the main goal we perform a data analysis of the online sales data by using machine learning methods as clustering, decision tree and association rules mining. After evaluating the proposed model, we discuss its use of the proposed model in the field of internet sales in the agricultural sector.; JEL Classification: C53, D11, D91, M21, M31 © 2020","association rules; Classification; consumer behavior; data analysis; online shopping","artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; data set; electronic commerce; machine learning; marketing","","","","","Grant Agency for Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport","Intelligence within Network Economy” (Contract No. 1/0201/19) funded by Grant Agency for Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.","Adamov Abzetdin Z., Mining Term Association Rules from Unstructured Text in Azerbaijani Language, 2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT), pp. 1-4, (2018); Alfian G., Ijaz M.

To deeply understand the relationships between retail prices and reviews, this paper designs an intelligent data-driven Generate/Test Cycle using a machine learning technique to automatically discover the relationship model from a huge amount of data without a prior hypothesis. From a unique dataset, various free-form relationship models with their own structures and parameters have been discovered. By the comprehensive evaluations of candidate models, a guided map was offered to understand the relationship between dynamic retail prices and the volume/valence of reviews for different types of products. Experimental results show that 37.69% of products in our sample exhibit the following trend: When the price is increased to a certain level, the volume of reviews shifts from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend. Results also demonstrate that a linearly increasing relationship model between prices and the valence of reviews is more suitable for the low-involvement products than for the high-involvement products. In addition to the new findings, this research provides a powerful tool to assist domain experts in building relationship models for decision making in a highly efficient manner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer reviews; Data-driven; Genetic programming; Machine learning; Product involvement; Retail price","Consumer behavior; Costs; Decision making; Sales; Turing machines; Comprehensive evaluation; Consumer reviews; Intelligent data; Machine discovery; Machine learning techniques; Model relationships; Post-purchase behaviors; Relationship model; Learning systems","","","","","Social Planning Foundation of Liaoning, (L17AGL012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071273, 71421001, 71671024, 71871041); Department of Education of Liaoning Province, (LN2020Q30); Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, DUFE, (DUFE2020Q08); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (DUT20JC38); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program, (XLYC1807143)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071273, 71671024, 71871041, 71421001), Research Funds of Education Department of Liaoning Province (LN2020Q30), Research Funds of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE2020Q08), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (DUT20JC38), Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program (XLYC1807143), and Social Planning Foundation of Liaoning (L17AGL012).","Olmedilla M., Martinez-Torres M., Toralc S., The superhit effect and long tail phenomenon in the context of electronic word of mouth, Decis.

The first two universities with the greatest number of patents on AI also have the highest average of citations per article: the University of Arizona (56.18) and Carnegie Mellon University (54.14). The University of Arizona has developed the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab) which is well known for contributions in health informatics, security informatics, business intelligence and knowledge management. Over the last 30 years AI Lab has received more than 40 million dollars in research funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and other agencies and corporations (University of Arizona Website). Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private non-profit research university based in Pennsylvania and it is one of the most outstanding research centres in the U.S. in the area of computer science and robotics, having a great reputation in AI and business. Some of the first AI software programs were created at CMU, including Logic Theorist, General Problem Solver, and Soar. CMU School of Computer Science also initiated a new undergraduate degree in AI in 2018. City University of Hong Kong (CityU) has also developed different programs on AI, such as Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence or Logistics and Artificial Intelligence. Universities with a higher number of patents have programs that relate scientific and academic research with its practical application in the field of business management in many different sectors, many of them promoted jointly with companies and some other institutions.; Funding text 2: There are also several funding agencies sponsoring research on AI in Business and Economics. The top ten is led in number by European entities: the European Commission (EC), the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) from the UK, and the Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras (FEDER) from Spain. Nevertheless, China is the most prolific country in terms of volume of articles sponsored. Specifically, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) has supported the publication of 144 articles to date, far exceeding the number of articles published by the other entities. Other Asian organisations such as Hong Kong Polytechnic; Funding text 3: University (PolyU) and National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC) are also relevant in this area. The National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S., the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Australian Research Council (ARC) complete the top ten of this ranking.","Altman E.

Although prior research efforts have attempted to investigate the behavior of users regarding the sharing of personal experiences and browsing the experiences of others online, it remains a challenge for business managers to incorporate eWOM effects into their business planning and decision-making processes effectively. Applying a newly proposed association rule mining technique, this study investigates eWOM in the context of the tourism industry using an outbound domestic tourism data set that was recently collected in Hong Kong. The complete profiles and the relations of online experience sharers and travel website browsers are explored. The empirical results are useful in helping tourism managers to define new target customers and to plan more effective marketing strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Association rules; Browsers; Data mining; Electronic word-of-mouth; Hong Kong; Machine learning; Outbound tourism; Sharers","China; Hong Kong; communication network; consumption behavior; data mining; data set; decision making; learning; leisure industry; preference behavior; tourism management; tourism market; World Wide Web","","","","","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (PolyU 5461/11H); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU, (G-YX5J)","We would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on improving an earlier version of this paper.

In addition to automating and optimizing existing processes, AI opens up new opportunities for purchasers to undertake new, strategic, collaborative, enduring missions. AI enables complex, strategic decision-making in an unpredictable, hostile environment. This article analyzes to what extent AI can improve the performance of the purchasing department. First, a review is undertaken of how AI is used in purchasing. Thereafter, the research follows an exploratory, inductive, and qualitative approach based on a multiple case study of the following technologies: (1) the Synertrade automated international purchasing system; (2) the Silex matching system; (3) SAP Ariba decision support; (4) Jaggaer supplier relations management; and (5) the Ideapoke collaborative ideation and innovative project management platform.

When there are many products to screen (or many features to evaluate), it is rational for consumers to use consider-then-choose decision processes and to do so with heuristic decision rules. Managerial decisions (product development, marketing communications, etc.) depend upon the ability to identify and react to consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. We provide managerial examples and review the state-of-the-art in the theory and measurement of consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. Advances in greedoid methods, Bayesian inference, machine-learning, incentive alignment, measurement formats, and unstructured direct elicitation make it feasible and cost-effective to understand, quantify, and simulate ""what-if"" scenarios for a variety of heuristics. These methods now apply to a broad set of managerial problems including applications in complex product categories with large numbers of product features and feature-levels. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Consideration sets; Consumer behavior; Decision heuristics; Fast-and-frugal decisions; Marketing; Product development","","","","","","Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology","The author is grateful for the constructive comments and suggestions made by Daria Dzyabura, Julian Marewski, and Shabnam Mousavi.

To retain consumers, practitioners aim to predict which consumers intend to churn (ie leave), and to understand the reasons behind this intention. To address this need, this study uses data-mining techniques to develop a churn prediction model. The study aims to identify the information that is predictive of churn and, consequently, to shed light on the psychological reasons behind churn. The authors built eight predictive models using decision trees, random forest and logistic regression on a dataset composed of 81,813 consumers of an energy provider, each with one residential electricity contract. The logistic regression was found to outperform the other methods. The discussion focuses on the relevant predictors of churn by addressing a posteriori psychological explanations of consumers’ churn behaviour. The study provides new insights on the reasons why customers churn and, by addressing theoretical psychological explanations, provides a data-mining model with robustness to contextual changes. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Churn prediction model; Consumer psychology; Customer churn; Energy market; Machine learning","","","","","","","","Neslin S.A., Gupta S., Kamakura W., Lu J.X., Mason C.H., Defection detection: measuring and understanding the predictive accuracy of customer churn models, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 2, pp. 204-211, (2006); Thaichon P., Quach T.N., Integrated marketing communications and their effects on customer switching intention, Journal of Relationship Marketing, 15, 1–2, pp. 1-16, (2016); Chuang Y.F., Pull-and-suck effects in Taiwan mobile phone subscribers switching intentions, Telecommunication Policy, 35, 2, pp. 128-140, (2011); Ganesh J., Arnold M.J., Reynolds K.E., Understanding the customer base of service providers: an examination of the differences between switchers and stayers, Journal of Marketing, 64, 3, pp. 65-87, (2000); Verbeke W., Martens D., Mues C., Baesens B., Building comprehensible customer churn prediction models with advanced rule induction techniques, Expert System with Application, 38, 3, pp. 2354-2364, (2011); Kuo Y.F., Hu T.L., Yang S.C., Effects of inertia and satisfaction in female online shoppers on repeat-purchase intention:The moderating roles of word-of-mouth and alternative attraction, Managing Service Quality: An International Journal, 23, 3, pp. 168-187, (2013); Keaveney S.M., Parthasarathy M., Customer switching behavior in online services: an exploratory study of the role of selected attitudinal, behavioral, and demographic factors, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 29, 4, pp. 374-390, (2001); Dalvi P.K, Khandge S.K., Deomore A., Bankar A., Kanade V.A., Analysis of customer churn prediction in telecom industry using decision trees and logistic regression, the 2016 Symposium on Colossal Data Analysis and Networking (CDAN), (2016); Ahmed A.A.Q., Maheswari D., Churn prediction on huge telecom data using hybrid firefly based classification, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 18, 3, pp. 2-7, (2016); Mahajan V., Misra R., Mahajan R., Review of data-mining techniques for churn prediction in telecom, Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences, 39, 2, pp. 183-197, (2015); Holtrop N., Wieringa J.E., Gijsenberg M.J., Verhoef P.C., No future without the past?

Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy. In this study, we propose a model that predicts audience numbers on the opening Saturday using market research data obtained through online and offline surveys to help distributors develop better marketing strategies. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Artificial intelligence; Box office; Decision support system; Machine learning; Marketing","","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea, (2018R1D1A1A02045842)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea ( 2018R1D1A1A02045842 ).

Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.

Companies are currently trying to take advantage of the useful collective knowledge available on social networks to support different types of marketing decisions. The appropriate analysis of this information can offer marketing professionals with important competitive advantages. This work proposes a new methodology to extract the social collective behavior of Twitter users concerning a group of brands based on the users’ temporal activity. Time series of mentions made by individual users to each company's Twitter account are aggregated to obtain collective activity data for the companies, which is a consequence of both the company's and other users’ actions. These data are processed using classical unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as temporal clustering and hidden Markov models, to extract collective temporal behavior patterns and models of the dynamics of customers over time for a single brand and groups of brands. The derived knowledge can be used for different tasks, such as identifying the impact of a marketing campaign on Twitter and comparatively assessing the social behaviors of different brands and groups of brands to assist in making marketing decisions. Our methodology is validated in a case study from the wine market. Twitter data were gathered from four regions of different countries around the world with important wineries (Italy: Veneto, Portugal: Porto and Douro Valley, Spain: La Rioja, and United States: Napa Valley), and comparative behavior analysis was carried out from the perspective of the use of Twitter as a communication channel for marketing campaigns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hidden Markov models;

Accurate price forecasts allow retailers to formulate appropriate marketing strategies and justify strategic procurement decisions. Accurate price forecasts should also reduce asymmetric price information. This study relies on consumers’ self-reported expectations about whether prices will increase or decrease in the coming weeks. Results from maximum likelihood stepwise autoregressions indicate that survey-based price expectations are leading indicators for chicken wing prices and contain the same information as BLS ground beef, pork chop, and deli ham prices.

Information propagates rapidly in social network and may reach a very large population within a very short period of time. An excessive amount of information shared in social networks not only costs computational and communicational resources but also causes the information overload problem, which results in the delay and difficulty of making decisions and may lead to physical and psychological strain. We used computer technologies to attack this information overload problem. First, we developed automatic decision-making mechanisms to help each individual effectively share information. Second, we built a simulation test bed and proposed an evaluation matrix and then conducted an experimental evaluation of six different information-sharing strategies in terms of interest degrees, reachability, appreciation degrees, and communication cost. We also implemented two intelligent response mechanisms. The first one allows users to order information pieces according to the learned ratings of the information sources. The second mechanism dynamically adjusts the network structure based on machine-learning results. The simulation results show that such mechanisms would be very useful to motivate social-network users to adopt more selective information-sharing strategies. © 2014 IEEE.","Information overload; information sharing; intelligent response; social networks","Decision making; Information analysis; Social networking (online); Amount of information; Computer technology; Experimental evaluation; Information overloads; Information sharing strategies; Intelligent information; Response mechanisms; Simulation test beds; Information dissemination","","","","","","","Hogan B., Analyzing social networks, the Sage Handbook of Online Research Methods.

In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

For this purpose, machine learning solution has already begun its promising marks in transportation as well as in many areas such as marketing, finance, education, and health. However, many classification algorithms in the literature assume that the target attribute values in the datasets are unordered, so they lose inherent order between the class values. To overcome the problem, this study proposes a novel ensemble-based ordinal classification (EBOC) approach which suggests bagging and boosting (AdaBoost algorithm) methods as a solution for ordinal classification problem in transportation sector. This article also compares the proposed EBOC approach with ordinal class classifier and traditional tree-based classification algorithms (i.e., C4.5 decision tree, RandomTree, and REPTree) in terms of accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed EBOC approach achieves better classification performance than the conventional solutions. © 2019 Pelin Yildirim et al.","","Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning systems; AdaBoost algorithm; Attribute values; C4.5 decision trees; Classification algorithm; Classification performance; Historical data; Ordinal classification; Transportation sector; Data mining","","","","","","","Lv Y., Duan Y., Kang W., Li Z., Wang F.-Y., Traffic flow prediction with big data: A deep learning approach, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 16, 2, pp. 865-873, (2015); Wen X., Shao L., Xue Y., Fang W., A rapid learning algorithm for vehicle classification, Information Sciences, 295, pp. 395-406, (2015); Ball S., Sagbas E.A., Diagnosis of transportation modes on mobile phone using logistic regression classification, IET Software, 12, 2, pp. 142-151, (2018); Nguyen H., Cai C., Chen F., Automatic classification of traffic incident's severity using machine learning approaches, IET Intelligent Transport Systems, 11, 10, pp. 615-623, (2017); Kedar-Dongarkar G., Das M., Driver classification for optimization of energy usage in a vehicle, Procedia Computer Science, 8, pp. 388-393, (2012); Deepika N., Sajith Variyar V.V., Obstacle classification and detection for vision based navigation for autonomous driving, Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI, 2017, pp. 2092-2097, (2017); Frank E., Hall M., A simple approach to ordinal classification, Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML) Volume 2167 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 145-156, (2001); Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2014); Destercke S., Yang G., Cautious ordinal classification by binary decomposition, Proceedings of the Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases-European Conference ECML/PKDD, pp. 323-337, (2014); Cardoso J.S., Pinto Da Costa J.F., Learning to classify ordinal data: The data replication method, Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 8, pp. 1393-1429, (2007); Li L., Lin H.T., Ordinal regression by extended binary classification, Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 865-872, (2006); Harrell F.E., Ordinal logistic regression, Regression Modeling Strategies, Springer Series in Statistics, pp. 311-325, (2015); Rennie J.D., Srebro N., Loss functions for preference levels: Regression with discrete ordered labels, Proceedings of the IJCAIMultidisciplinaryWorkshop Adv.

To counter the negative impact of social media marketing, some firms have begun hiring people to generate fake reviews which either promote their own products or damage their competitor’s reputation. This study proposes a framework, which takes advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, for the observation of behaviors among spammers. Then, based on the behavior of participants on web forums, the authors build up a post-reply network. The main focus is on the behavior-related features of the reviews, their propagation, and their popularity. The primary objective of this study is to build an effective online spammer detection model and the method detailed in this work can be used to improve the performance of spammer detection models. An experiment is carried out with a real dataset, the results of which indicate that these new features are important for identifying spammers. Finally, random walk clustering is applied to investigate the post-reply network. Some interesting and important features are observed in the interactions between a group of spammers which could be subjected to further research. © 2021 IGI Global.

Sentiment Analysis in social media plays a vital role in monitoring of public opinion behind certain topics. Actually 92% of marketing professionals thought that social media has intense effect on their business. By doing an accurate sentiment analysis, winning might not be an impossible thing. Success does not depend only in the number of likes, comments or followers. It also depends in how much positive discussions have been held among the users of social media. The objective of this paper is to build a model that performs multi-class classification of Big data with improved accuracy. The proposed model uses a hybrid of Lexicon-based approach and Machine Learning based approach. In this paper, we have performed the sentiment analysis on the three Central Government Schemes namely Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Make-in India. The Apache Spark’s Machine Learning library, MLlib has been used in order to achieve better results in sentiment analysis for the Big Data. The AFINN dictionary was used to label the tweets and bigrams feature set was used. The Hashing TF-IDF method was used to extract the feature vectors from the raw feature set. These vectors were classified by Random Forest classifier to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments of tweets. The result from this model was tested by using the various testing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-score. The higher accuracy of 89.27% was obtained. © 2020, Research Trend.

They struggle to find answers to: • Who can I consider a loyal customer? • What kind of marketing strategy is most likely to increase sales? • What can customer-purchasing patterns reveal about improving inventory control? • What is the most effective way to manage customer relations to increase revenues? (Rabinovitch, 1999). With the exponential growth in the amount of data being collected, improvements in technology, and research in machine learning, retailers are now able to reduce the ever growing difficult and complex decision making process by recruiting the efforts of data mining (Barry & Linoff, 1997). Data mining is a computerized technology that uses complicated algorithms to find relationships and trends in large data bases, real or perceived, previously unknown to the retailer, to promote decision support. Currently being utilized by such retail giants as Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom, and Wal-Mart, Inc., data mining is touted to be one of the greatest technologies to hit the retailing industry this decade (Rabinovitch, 1999). The purpose of this study is to critique data mining technology in comparison with more familiar analytical tools for strategic decision making by small to medium size retailers. The context for this study includes current and future industry applications and practices for research performed in data mining applications within the retail sector.","Data mining; Decision making; Marketing strategy; Retailers; Strategic planning; Technology","","","","","","","","Anderson J.L., Profiles of Successful Graduate Students Using Artificial Neural Networking and Simultaneous Multiple Regression, (2001); Arlitt M., Krishnamurthy D., Rolia J., Characterizing the scalability of large web-based shopping systems, ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, (1), 1, pp. 44-69, (2001); Berkin P., Beche J.D., Randall D.J., Interactive path analysis of web site traffic, American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Proceedings, pp. 414-419, (2001); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G., Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales and Customer Support, (1997); Brijs T., Swinnen G., Vanhoof K., Wets G., Using association rules for product assortment decisions: A case study, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, (1999); Brijs T., Goethals B., Swinnen G., Vanhoof K., Wets G., A data mining framework for optimal product selection in a retail supermarket: The generalized PROFSET model, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, (2000); Cabena P., Hadjinian P., Stadler R., Verhees J., Zanasi A., Discovering Data Mining: from Concept to Implementation, (1998); Data mining/CRM: Searching for an ROI, Chain Store Age, pp. 24-26, (2001); Data Mining: What Is Data Mining?; An Overview of Data Mining at Dun and Bradstreet, (1995); Decker P., Data mining's hidden dangers, Banking Strategies, 74, 2, pp. 6-14, (1998); Dhond A., Gupta A., Vadhavkar S., Data mining techniques for optimizing inventories for electronic commerce, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 480-486, (2000); Do-it-yourself data mining, Marketing Computers, 16, 11, pp. 1-2, (1996); Foley J., Russell J.D., Mining your own business, Informationweek, 673, pp. 18-20, (1998); Fonseca B., Personalization and web analysis sink in, Infoworld, (22), 29, (2000); Growing lifetime value, Chain Store Age, (75), 5, (1999); Hollander G., Model 1 deftly pares customer characteristics, Infoworld, 20, 21, (1998); Kempster M., Digging for data, Inform, 12, 6, pp. 22-30, (1998); Keen P.G.W., Let's focus on action not info, Computerworld, (1997); Kroll K.M., Sears Canada gains improved customer knowledge with data mining and analysis, Stores, (83), 4, pp. 128-129, (2001); Lee J., Podlaseck M., Using a starfield visualization of ranalyzing product performance of online stores, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 168-175, (2000); Lee J., Podlaseck M., Schonberg E., Hoch R., Visualization and analysis of click stream data of online stores for understanding web merchandising, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (5), 1-2, pp. 59-84, (2001); Maselli J., Business-intelligence pays off for Nordstrom, Information Week, (825), (2001); Mining the store, Chain Store Age, 76, 1, pp. 4-5, (2000); Murphy P.A., Focus on existing customers seen driving revenue growth, Stores, pp. 32-34, (1998); Parks L., Information resources inc, Drug Store News, (22), 9, pp. 219-222, (2000); Peacock P.R., Data mining in marketing: Part 1, Marketing Management, pp. 9-18, (1998); Press S., Fool's gold, Sales and Marketing Management, 150, 6, pp. 58-62, (1998); Rabinovitch L., America's ""first"" department store mines customer data, Direct Marketing, (62), 8, (1999); Ritzer J.R., New rule-based systems tackle employee shrink, Stores, (78), 8, pp. 71-72, (1996); Rubbermaid mines for profits, Discount Store News, (38), 6, (1999); Small R.D., Debunking Data Mining Myths.

The past decade has witnessed an increased use of user-generated content (UGC) analysis as a marketing tool to make better informed decisions. Likewise, textual data analysis of UGC has gained much attention among tourism and hospitality scholars. Nonetheless, most of the scholarly works have focused on the singular application of an existing method or technique rather than using a multi-method approach. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel Web analytics methodology to examine online reviews posted by tourists in real time and assist decision-makers tasked with marketing strategy and intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: For illustration, the case of tourism campaign in India was undertaken. A total of 305,298 reviews were collected, and after filtering, 276,154 reviews were qualified for analysis using a string of models. Descriptive charts, sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling and machine learning algorithms for real-time classification were applied. Findings: Using big data from TripAdvisor, a total of 145 tourist destinations were clustered based on tourists’ perceptions. Further exploration of each cluster through topic modeling was conducted, which revealed interesting insights into satisfiers and dissatisfiers of different clusters of destinations. The results supported the use of the proposed multi-method Web-analytics approach. Practical implications: The proposed machine learning model demonstrated that it could provide real-time information on the sentiments in each incoming review about a destination. This information might be useful for taking timely action for improvisation or controlling a service situation. Originality/value: In terms of Web-analytics and UGC, a comprehensive analytical model to perform an end-to-end understanding of tourist behavior patterns and offer the potential for real-time interpretation is rarely proposed. The current study not only proposes such a model but also offers empirical evidence for a successful application. It contributes to the literature by providing scholars interested in textual analytics a step-by-step guide to implement a multi-method approach. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","India; Text analytics; Tourism; User-generated content","","","","","","","","Alaei A.R., Becken S., Stantic B., Sentiment analysis in tourism: capitalizing on big data, Journal of Travel Research, 58, 2, pp. 175-191, (2019); Ali F., Park E., Kwon J., Chae B., 30 years of contemporary hospitality management: uncovering the bibliometrics and topical trends, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 7, pp. 2641-2665, (2019); Amaro S., Duarte P., Henriques C., Travelers’ use of social media: a clustering approach, Annals of Tourism Research, 59, pp. 1-15, (2016); Anagnostopoulou S.C., Buhalis D., Kountouri I.L., Manousakis E.G., Tsekrekos A.E., The impact of online reputation on hotel profitability, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 32, 1, pp. 20-39, (2020); Baker M.A., Kim K., Value destruction in exaggerated online reviews: the effects of emotion, language, and trustworthiness, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 4, pp. 1956-1976, (2019); Banerjee S., Chua A.Y., In search of patterns among travellers' hotel ratings in TripAdvisor, Tourism Management, 53, pp. 125-131, (2016); Calheiros A.C., Moro S., Rita P., Sentiment classification of consumer-generated online reviews using topic modelling, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 26, 7, pp. 675-693, (2017); Chakraborty U., Perceived credibility of online hotel reviews and its impact on hotel booking intentions, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 9, pp. 3465-3483, (2019); Chang Y.C., Ku C.H., Chen C.H., Social media analytics: extracting and visualizing Hilton Hotel ratings and reviews from TripAdvisor, International Journal of Information Management, 48, pp. 263-279, (2019); Chang Y.C., Ku C.H., Chen C.H., Using deep learning and visual analytics to explore hotel reviews and responses, Tourism Management, 80, (2020); Choi Y., Hickerson B., Kerstetter D., Understanding the sources of online travel information, Journal of Travel Research, 57, 1, pp. 116-128, (2018); Chu S.-C., Deng T., Cheng H., The role of social media advertising in hospitality, tourism and travel: a literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 32, 11, (2020); Claveria Gonzalez O., Poluzzi A., Positioning and clustering of the world's top tourist destinations by means of dimensionality reduction techniques for categorical data, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 6, 1, pp. 22-32, (2017); Dayour F., Park S., Kimbu A., Backpackers’ perceived risks towards smartphone usage and risk reduction strategies: a mixed methods study, Tourism Management, 72, pp. 52-68, (2019); Dickinger A., Lalicic L., Mazanec J., Exploring the generalizability of discriminant word items and latent topics in online tourist reviews, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 29, 2, pp. 803-816, (2017); Farquad M.A.H., Ravi V., Raju S.B., Churn prediction using comprehensible support vector machine: an analytical CRM application, Applied Soft Computing, 19, pp. 31-40, (2014); Filieri R., Alguezaui S., McLeay F., Why do travelers trust TripAdvisor?
