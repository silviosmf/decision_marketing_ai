The 1982-83 factory automation surveys project of the Boston University Manufacturing Roundtable reported on here was designed to develop a broad managerial view of computer-aided manufacturing processes in the US. Our purpose was to create a body of information, drawn from the recent experience of leading-edge practitioners, that would begin to describe the range of behaviors accompanying the adoption and implementation of automation technologies, such as advanced numerical control, CAD/CAM and robots, which may be combined to form the ""factory of the future"". In short, we wanted to identify the kinds of progress being made by these manufacturers and the barriers that they, and those who are contemplating such process innovations, will face in the future. In each of our three surveys we had a specific target population in mind. The ""user"" survey was aimed at discrete-part manufacturing organizations that were leaders in adopting factory automation technologies. This survey was designed to address ""best practice"" at the level of a single strategic business unit and deals with specific automation projects. Our ""supplier"" survey was aimed at the major producers of each of the various factory automation technologies. Here we sought the observations and opinions of senior marketing executives in those firms with the most success (and therefore experience) in supplying computer-based manufacturing technologies. Finally, our ""expert"" survey was designed to test some of our preliminary findings from the users and suppliers, including insights gathered from in-depth follow-up telephone interviews with respondents to those two surveys. We intentionally tried to identify a broad sample of individuals whose views would be based on extensive factory automation experience in different capacities. Respondents to our three surveys consisted of 57 users, 38 suppliers and 64 experts. Findings from the three surveys form certain patterns that transcend the isolated facts commonly presented in the literature. The dominant impressions that emerged from the data were:. Leading-edge users of computer-aided manufacturing processes believe in learning by doing. Most have proceeded in an incremental fashion to develop an internal base of experience with factory automation technologies. They tend to have supportive management and a sense of where they are heading. Their current measurement capabilities, however, restrict the basis for making adoption decisions as well as the subsequent evaluation of impacts from recent technological innovations. These users usually rely heavily on outside suppliers for critical technical assistance and consider reliability factors to be more important than price in selecting a vendor. They generally feel they cannot afford to postpone decisions until improved technologies become available. Current leadingedge users will strongly affect the future direction of these technologies. Suppliers claim that most manufacturers are not sophisticated customers. They would like potential users to be more aware of their needs for improved manufacturing processes and to be more interested in the long-term strategic benefits of computer-aided manufacturing technologies already on the market. A classic dilemma seems to have arisen: decisions to adopt expensive factory automation technologies are often made by managers who lack the background to assess technological options, while staff familiar with the new technologies are less able to appreciate associated strategic dimensions. A likely outcome is a decision that is either short-sighted or misguided. Suppliers with limited direct experience in new applications of their technologies and little indepth knowledge of the business situations of their customers cannot be expected to help users avoid such errors. The most difficult problems in achieving computer integrated manufacturing are managerial rather than technical. Manufacturers contemplating factory automation face different issues depending on whether they adopt a retrofit strategy using existing production systems or whether they attempt to make a fresh start as new facilities are brought on stream. In either case, they often have inadequate internal technical resources, strong barriers to communication across traditional functional lines, and a reward structure that does not encourage risk-taking in the interest of long-term strategic gains. Manufacturing organizations that do not deal directly with these kinds of managerial problems are not likely to succeed in factory automation, even if appropriate technological options exist. These functions suggest that manufacturing managers ought to reflect on their organization's current strengths and weaknesses as they formulate a strategy for factory automation. In particular, they should begin with a healthy concern for the adequacy of their current base of knowledge, mix of human resources and formal measurement systems. They should also refine their expectations for integrated factory automation applications, to be sure that general goals such as ""enhanced flexibility"" have explicit operational meanings. Finally, they should improve their organization's ability to identify types of indirect costs, as well as benefits, that are implicit in such goals. These prescriptions apply to manufacturers just beginning to adopt programmable manufacturing technologies, as well as to those who are well along this path. Further in-depth research is needed if the progress being made by leading-edge users is to serve as a basis for more widespread attempts to move toward the ""factory of the future"". © 1984.","","","","","","","","","Bylinksy, The Race to the Automatic Factory, Fortune, (1983); Frohman, Technology As a Competitive Weapon, Harvard Business Review, (1982); Gerwin, Tarondeau, Case Studies of Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems: A View of Uncertainty and Innovation Processes, Journal of Operations Management, 2, 2, pp. 87-89, (1982); Gold, CAM Sets New Rules for Productivity, Harvard Business Review, (1982); Goldhar, Jelinek, Plan for Economies of Scope, Harvard Business Review, (1983); Gunn, The Mechanization of Design and Manufacturing, Scientific American, (1982); Hayes, Abernathy, Managing our Way to Economic Decline, Harvard Business Review, (1980); Kantrow, The Strategy-Technology Connection, Harvard Business Review, (1980); Kimnicun, Flexible Systems Invade the Factory, High Technology, (1983); Miller, The 1983 Manufacturing Futures Project: Summary of North American Survey Responses and Preliminary Report, (1983); Sfiligoj, $10M Machining Cell Is Keystone For Vought's Plant of the Future, Metal Working News, (1983); Smith, Et al., CAD/CAM International Delphi Forecast, (1980); Yin, The Case Study as a Serious Research Strategy, Knowledge, 3, 1, pp. 97-114, (1981); Zaltman, Duncan, Holbek, Innovations and Organizations, (1973); The Computer: The Tool for Today, American Machinist, Special Report 746, (1982)","","","","","","","","","02726963","","JOTME","","English","J Oper Manage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000720545"

We consider an entry mode selection problem facing an organic farmer. Specifically, an incumbent conventional farmer is selling its product through an independent retailer on the market. An organic farmer aiming to enter the market faces the problem of selecting between the conventional farmer's retailer and an organic-only retailer. Consumers are heterogeneous in their purchasing valuation of the conventional agricultural product and its organic alternative. Horizontal competition between the two competing farmers is considered under different scenarios. Multiple-stage games are analyzed to study the impact of different cases on the pricing decision and profit of each player. The results show that when the organic agricultural product enters the market through the incumbent conventional retailer, two types of products are sold through a common retailer, the competition between the two farmers will be intensified, and the profit at the retail end will increase. It is always better for the organic farmer to sell an organic agricultural product through an independent organic-only retailer than to sell it through the incumbent conventional retailer. The paper makes two contributions. First, we derive the explicit equilibrium under chain-to-chain competition with piecewise linear demand functions. Second, we link the analytical marketing literature on channel structures with the supply chain literature on chain-to-chain competition and apply them to the food supply chain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chain-to-chain competition; Entry; Food supply chain; Mode selection","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Commerce; Food supply; Functions; Piecewise linear techniques; Profitability; Supply chains; Channel structures; Demand function; Entry mode; Multiple stages; Organic foods; Piecewise linear; Pricing decision; Sales","","","","","Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71871105); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province, (JY-012); Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province, (2020SJZDA061)","Funding text 1: We thank the editor and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications: This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value: While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment. © 2024, Myriam Quinones, Jaime Romero, Anne Schmitz and Ana M.

Academic/practical relevance: In a cooperative (co-op), operational and financial decisions are inseparable because the co-op's investment capital is linked to its economic transactions with members. We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield. Managerial implications: The results provide insight into a coop's decision making, cash position, and risk management. © 2019 INFORMS","Cooperative; Coordination; Finance and operations; Proportional investment; Risk","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Behavioral research; Commerce; Investments; Marketing; Markov processes; Risk management; Economic transactions; Expected present values; Financial decisions; Investment capital; Managerial implications; Market uncertainty; Markov Decision Processes; Problem definition; Decision making","","","","","SfTI National Science Challenge, (CRSS4-2016); Te Punah; Te Puµnahuµ Matatini Centre of Research Excellence","Funding text 1: Financial support for X.

As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture, enormous farming data, such as agricultural information, capacity buildings, training, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. e-Learning technologies have clearly emerged as development poles for rural development and food security through growths for access to knowledge and exchange through advance agricultural communication tools. A multistage random sampling technique was used by 300 selected e-Learning users from rural areas with a simple linear regression model via SPSS. A comprehensive analysis is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research. One of the main obstacles that farmers were not aware and training of technical information flows in rural development. Therefore, ICTs services and applications have been highly significant for agricultural technical capacity in rural development.

One of the main goals of this campaign is the implementation of the sustainability principles in the development and deployment cycle of the new generation technologies. This paper focuses on the fast-growing field of autonomous mobile robots and the harsh environment exploration problem. Currently, most state-of-the-art navigation methods are utilising the idea of evaluating candidate observation locations by combining different task-related criteria. However, these map building solutions are often designed for operating in near-perfect environments, neglecting such factors as the danger to the robot. In this paper, a new strategy that aims to address the safety and re-usability of the autonomous mobile agent by implementing the economic sustainability principles is proposed. A novel multi-criteria decision-making method ofWeighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment-Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets, namely WASPAS-SVNS, and the weight selection method of Step-Wise Weights Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) are applied to model a dynamic decision-making system. The experimental evaluation of the proposed strategy shows that increased survivability of the autonomous agent can be observed. Compared to the greedy baseline strategy, the proposed method forms the movement path which orients the autonomous agent away from dangerous obstacles. © 2019 by the authors.","Autonomous robot; Harsh environment; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neutrosophic sets; Sustainability; SWARA; WASPAS-SVNS","decision making; environmental conditions; European Union; experimental study; exploration; implementation process; marketing; multicriteria analysis; robotics; sustainability","","","","","","","Bi Z., Revisiting System Paradigms from the Viewpoint of Manufacturing Sustainability, Sustainability, 3, pp. 1323-1340, (2011); Closing the Loop-An EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy, (2015); Report on Critical Raw Materials and the Circular Economy, (2018); Bugmann G., Siegel M., Burcin R., A role for robotics in sustainable development?, Proceedings of the IEEE Africon'11, Livingstone, Zambia, 13-15 September 2011, pp. 1-4, (2011); World Robotics Report 2016, (2018); Khaleghi A.M., Xu D., Wang Z., Li M., Lobos A., Liu J., Son Y.-J., A DDDAMS-based planning and control framework for surveillance and crowd control via UAVs and UGVs, Expert Syst.

Box 616, Netherlands","This study explored the rather rapid adoption of a new surgical device - the da Vinci robot - in the Netherlands despite the high costs and its controversial clinical benefits. We used the concept 'affordances' as a conceptual-analytic tool to refer to the perceived promises, symbolic meanings, and utility values of an innovation constructed in the wider social context of use. This concept helps us empirically understand robot adoption. Data from 28 in-depth interviews with diverse purposively-sampled stakeholders, and from medical literature, policy documents, Health Technology Assessment reports, congress websites and patients' weblogs/forums between April 2009 and February 2014 were systematically analysed from the perspective of affordances. We distinguished five interrelated affordances of the robot that accounted for shaping and fulfilling its rapid adoption: 'characteristics-related' affordances such as smart nomenclature and novelty, symbolising high-tech clinical excellence; 'research-related' affordances offering medical-technical scientific excellence; 'entrepreneurship-related' affordances for performing better-than-the-competition; 'policy-related' affordances indicating the robot's liberalised provision and its reduced financial risks; and 'communication-related' affordances of the robot in shaping patients' choices and the public's expectations by resonating promising discourses while pushing uncertainties into the background. These affordances make the take-up and use of the da Vinci robot sound perfectly rational and inevitable. This Dutch case study demonstrates the fruitfulness of the affordances approach to empirically capturing the contextual dynamics of technology adoption in health care: exploring in-depth actors' interaction with the technology while considering the interpretative spaces created in situations of use. This approach can best elicit real-life value of innovations, values as defined through the eyes of (potential) users. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Affordance; Da Vinci robot; Decision-making; Qualitative ethnographic evaluation; Science, technology and society studies; Surgical device; Technology adoption; The Netherlands","Communication; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Diffusion of Innovation; Humans; Marketing of Health Services; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Netherlands; Qualitative Research; Robotics; Netherlands; decision making; health services; innovation; medicine; qualitative analysis; robotics; science and technology; technology adoption; adjustment; article; cost benefit analysis; health care cost; health care policy; medical technology; Netherlands; risk assessment; robotics; social acceptance; social desirability; social evolution; surgical equipment; surgical technology; devices; economics; financial management; human; interpersonal communication; mass communication; minimally invasive surgery; procedures; qualitative research; robotics; utilization","","","da Vinci, Intuitive Surgical, United States","Intuitive Surgical, United States","","","Abrishami P., Da Vinci Surgery: Is it a No-brainer?

This includes prolonged dry season, erratic and insufficient rainfall, too early and too late rains and temperature rise. Unexpected heavy rains and snow events as well as weather change-driven pests and diseases negatively affect not only the volume of coffee production and quality but also the prices. The effects of climate change risks add pressure on the existing challenges such as land shortage and fragmentation, declining soil fertility and weeds. Lack of participation in decision-making and corruption are additional challenges for the coffee growers. Although the farmers rely on multiple production-related adaptation responses, most of the deployed strategies to the changing environment are less effective and short-term. The paper concluded that policy interventions should better comprehend the local vulnerability to build resilience and to undertake sustainable agricultural practices for improving the farmers’ adaptive capacity to deal with the effects of climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change impacts; Coffee production challenges; Fero-two PA; Southern Ethiopia; Sustainable agricultural practices; Wensho district","Ethiopia; Sidama; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Costs; Decision making; Rain; Surveys; Adaptation response; Adaptive capacity; Changing environment; Climate change impact; Climate change risks; In-depth interviews; Policy intervention; Sustainable agricultural; climate change; climate effect; coffee; crop production; decision making; household survey; policy approach; Climate change","","","","","Department of Sociology and Human Geography; Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund","The author would like to thank the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund to study Ph.D. in Norway and the Department of Sociology and Human Geography for additional financial support for fieldworks.

Although these theories differ on a variety of dimensions, including domains of application and specific definitions, they all share the basic assumption that two different modes of information processing operate in making judgments, decisions as well as in solving problems. In essence, the common distinction in dual process modes is between a fast, associative information process mode with low effort heuristics, and a slow, rule-based mode with high effort systematic process. On the basis of a brief theoretical development introduction, we illustrate how the dual process theory is manifested in various disciplines. Table 1 summarizes the different representations of dual process, including heuristic vs. systematic; peripheral route vs. central route; associative access vs. attitude construct; categorization vs. individuation; automatic contextual influences vs. correction; experiential vs. rational; impulsive vs. reflective; implicit vs. explicit. Later on, we discuss how different types of information processing modes are determined and what the main factors that may significantly influence information processing adoption. Several determinants are identified froma review of the extant literature; for instance, the involvement would be an influential factor that affects what type of information processing mode adopted. Specifically, if an information processor does not have a high level of involvement, it would be more likely of him / her to adopt a heuristic mode comparing with a systematic mode. Similarly, if a consumer does not in a focal status of high motivation, comparing with the one with a high level of motivation, he/ she would be more likely to adopt a heuristic mode. The related factors that are generally discussed in previous studied are shown in Table 2. Although we may learn that these factors as listed are playing significant roles in influencing what type of information processing mode adopted, little has been discussed in prior research in relation to the possible interaction effects that would play a role. In particular, we could conjecture that a higher level of motivation of information processor would be more likely to adopt systematic information processing mode, but what would be happen if the information processor does not have a higher level of ability to process the information in order to make a judgment or decision? Will the information processor adopt systematic mode or heuristic mode? Moreover, when we try to take the risk as an important factor into consideration, if the decision context is with a high risk, will the information processor adopt systematic processing mode even if he/ she does not have the ability to process related information? Whether the processor would adopt heuristic processing mode when he / she does not have the ability to process? This calls for future research to further explore more rich findings and interesting underlying mechanisms. The exploration of the impacts aroused by various influential factors would be a bright future. Future research could be extended on the basis of the current theory at least from the following three facets. First, the exploration of the theory application. As we discussed above, most of previous studies emphasize on investigating the independent effect of individual factor on information processing mode adoption, while little has been discussed on the underlying effects aroused by interactive factors in various contexts. Take the online product review context-a hot topic studied in information systems, marketing, as well as electronic commerce disciplines-as an example, our review of recent studies shows that although the dual process theories have been widely applied to examine the effects of online product reviews, or the review helpfulness itself, there is scant research regarding what factors that really determine which type of information processing mode used, and whether the information processing mode would be dynamically caused by various interactive factors. On the basis of the analysis of our paper which argues that the determinant factors that would be interactive in affecting the information processing mode, related future research with respect to this area could be widely extended. As regard to the research methodology in examining the focal theory, secondly, we call for more advanced method which could be used in future research in order to explore more interesting findings. Particularly, the current studies in relation to the dual process theories largely focus on experimental method or survey, while few attentions have been paid by using behavioral data to deduce what type of information processing mode being used. Based on the research logic presented by recent seminal papers such as Gladstone et al., Stachl et al. and Wu et al., we think it is feasible to extend the method scope to examine this theory. In addition, third, with respect to the extension of the theory itself, in line the recent arguments of seminal papers published on Nature (Rahwan et al.) and California Management Review (Huang et al., we may conjecture that the dual process theory could be extended in the new artificial intelligence era. In particular, during the interaction between human and robot (artificial intelligence), it is imperative to understand whether the robot, cognitively, will use these two different types of processing modes in their information processing like human? How would the robot be in the eye of human when the brain becomes to integrate with robot? Will the robot be the third processing mode complementing with the original two processing mode? Or will the robot interrupt the original two processing modes? Or will the robot replace the one type of either processing mode? We call for future research to further explore the bright and interesting area to explore the effects of interaction between human and robot. © 2021.

But how can the brands shield themselves from scandals and other limitations of human influencers? The solution for many companies has involved robots. Virtual influencers (VI) are virtual robots that can emulate human appearance and behaviour and have become a trend in marketing. This study analyses how non-human influencers affect marketing communication by adopting two methods that are unpublished in the investigation of this phenomenon: a systematic literature review and netnography in conjunction with in-depth interviews with specialists resulting in the study identifying five categories (two of which are unpublished and unexplored in the literature) that can facilitate management decisions and also future studies around VIs: anthropomorphism/humanization, attractiveness, authenticity, scalability, and controllability. This study also identified more convergences than divergences between the virtual and the real and between humans and non-humans, generating challenges, opportunities, and guidelines for future research and for assisting management in making decisions concerning digital marketing. © 2021, Australasian Journal of Information Systems.","artificial intelligence; digital marketing; exploratory study; robots; virtual influencers; virtualization","","","","","","","","Alexander J., Virtual creators aren’t AI — but AI is coming for them, (2019); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.

Accordingly, it can be estimated that 40% of the 9.4 billion estimated world population will face water shortages by 2050. In this case, the ownership and efficient use of water stand out as common concerns for all communities in the world for today and for the future. In this research, the attitudes of consumers towards water saving were identified and factors that affect these attitudes were analysed within a sample from the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The survey was conducted through a face-to-face survey with 965 households in three Turkish provinces in 2009. SPSS statistical package was used for factor analysis to determine the affecting factors. Variables affecting water-saving decisions were reduced to seven factors via 0.792 KMO value. These seven factors explained 62.18% of the total variation in water-saving consciousness of the target group. Accordingly, it was understood that marketing policies should focus on water crisis awareness, environmental awareness, anxiety about water shortage, residential area characteristics, water pricing, the current awareness level and social willingness on reduction of water use to cope with possible problems. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Consumer attitudes; Factor analysis; Turkey; Water saving; Water usage","Mediterranean Region; Turkey; Agricultural robots; Multivariant analysis; Surveys; Water conservation; Water supply; Consumer attitudes; Efficient use of water; Environmental awareness; Food and agriculture organizations; Statistical packages; Turkey; Water - savings; Water usage; attitudinal survey; consumption behavior; coping strategy; Food and Agricultural Organization; future prospect; household survey; marketing; resource scarcity; urban area; water management; water planning; water stress; water supply; water use efficiency; Factor analysis","","","","","TÜBİTAK; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK, (108K616)","We would like to express our thanks to TÜBİTAK (the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) (Project number: 108K616) for their financial support to this project.

Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service","","","","","","Groningen Digital Business Center","The authors wish to convey their appreciation to the special issue editors Nicolai Fabian, Evert de Haan, and in particular thank Arnd Vomberg as the editor of this paper for his insightful and valuable inputs and constructive feedback during the entire review process.

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation","","","","","","","","Abijith A., Wamba S.F., Business value of RFID-enabled healthcare transformation projects, Business Process Management Journal, 19, 1, (2012); Barney J., Wright M., Ketchen D.J., The resource-based view of the firm: ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Benko A., Lanyi C.S., History of artificial intelligence, Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 1759-1762, (2009); Benner M.J., Dynamic or static capabilities?

Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics","Artificial intelligence; Environmental management; Location; Product design; Purchasing; Sales; Autonomous learning; Consumer evaluation; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Environmental problems; Environmental sustainability; Hierarchical linear modeling; Need for cognitions; Sustainable development","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16K13396, 19K21707, 20H01554); Waseda University, (2019C-152)","The author is grateful to all survey respondents and to Yang Yang and Shan Zheng for their contributions to the data collection.
