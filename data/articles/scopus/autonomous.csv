This paper illustrates a theoretical underpinning of the observed practice. A video rental supply chain is modelled to study pricing and replenishment decision making by the two autonomous firms in the chain, namely a movie studio producing the tapes and a video rental shop renting the tapes to customers. In the model the movie studio is to set the price for selling the tapes to the video rental store and the video rental shop must decide the number of copies of the new movie videotape it should purchase. The paper illustrates that revenue sharing contract can optimize the chain and bring win-win situations to the players in the industry. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

It is a practical means for creating comfortable, personalized environments in which learners can take a more active part in making decisions and choices in their language learning trajectories. In the domain of second language (L2) listening, self-access work can fulfill the individual needs of learners whose listening processes are supposed to be respected. However, in countries where English is taught as a foreign language (EFL), this is not always the case due to traditional teacher-led large-sized listening classrooms and test-oriented curricula. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate Vietnamese students’ perceptions of a self-access listening platform (SALP) which was built to facilitate L2 beginners to get familiar with the fast delivery of speech and to involve their personal interpretations of the input into the comprehension process. The study also aimed to examine whether this self-access approach can cultivate autonomous listening. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews with 15 non-English major university students whose disciplines were business management, marketing, communication, and public relations. They completed a six-week listening course on this online listening platform. The major findings indicate that students had positive listening experiences with the SALP regarding time flexibility and practicality. Despite students’ full awareness of the potential benefits of the SALP, a few of them still showed resistance to the self-access listening approach as a substitution for traditional classroom-based listening. The results reported here shed new light on the possibilities of implementing autonomy-based listening in a virtual self-access environment in L2 listening pedagogy. © 2023 Author(s).","learner autonomy; learners’ perceptions; self-access language learning; self-access listening; Vietnamese EFL learners","","","","","","","","Alzahrani S., Wright V., Design and management of a self-access language learning space integrated into a taught course, Studies in Self-Access Learning Journal, 7, 2, pp. 136-151, (2016); Benson P., The philosophy and politics of learner autonomy, Autonomy and independence in language learning, pp. 18-34, (1997); Benson P., Voller P., Autonomy and independence in language learning, (1997); Bozorgian H., Shamsi E., Autonomous use of podcasts with metacognitive intervention: Foreign language listening development, International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 32, 3, pp. 442-458, (2022); Brod M., Tesler L.

While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","artificial intelligence; autonomous vehicles; brand concept; innovation; self-brand connection","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Keller K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 27-41, (1990); Aboulnasr K., Tran G.A., Is love really blind?

Raad, Wufeng, Taichung County, Taiwan","Automated negotiation by autonomous agents has become increasingly important since the advent of e-marketplace. In this study, automated negotiation is viewed as a search process in which negotiators jointly search for a mutually acceptable contract in a multidimensional space formed by negotiable issues. This search is formulated as a multiple-objective decision making problem and is solved through an iterative process of generating offers by fuzzy inference systems. These fuzzy inference systems serve as a search heuristic and are formulated based on the strategy of issue trade-offs. Five experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed automated negotiation algorithm. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Calibration; Empirical method; Innovation diffusion; Literature review; Validation","Autonomous agents; Calibration; Diffusion; Maximum likelihood estimation; Agent-based model; Empirical method; Innovation diffusion; Literature reviews; Validation; Computational methods","","","","","Solar Energy Evolution and Diffusion Studies; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1526860, IIS-1526860); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-15-1-2621); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements This work was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, under the Solar Energy Evolution and Diffusion Studies (SEEDS) program, the National Science Foundation (IIS-1526860), and the Office of Naval Research (N00014-15-1-2621).; Funding text 2: This work was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, under the Solar Energy Evolution and Diffusion Studies (SEEDS) program, the National Science Foundation (IIS-1526860), and the Office of Naval Research (N00014-15-1-2621).","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organ Behav Hum Decis Process, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alexander P., Moran D., Rounsevell M.D., Smith P., Modelling the perennial energy crop market: the role of spatial diffusion, J R Soc Interface, 10, 88, (2013); Alexander P., Moran D., Smith P., Hastings A., Wang S., Sunnenberg G., Lovett A., Tallis M.J., Casella E., Taylor G., Et al., Estimating uk perennial energy crop supply using farm-scale models with spatially disaggregated data, GCB Bioenergy, 6, 2, pp. 142-155, (2014); Axelrod R.M., The complexity of cooperation: agent-based models of competition and collaboration, (1997); Axtell R., Axelrod R., Epstein J.M., Cohen M.D., Aligning simulation models: a case study and results, Comput Math Organ Theory, 1, 2, pp. 123-141, (1996); Bakshy E., Rosenn I., Marlow C., Adamic L., The role of social networks in information diffusion, International World Wide Web Conference, ACM, pp. 519-528, (2012); Banks J., Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice, (1998); Barabasi A.L., Albert R., Jeong H., Mean-field theory for scale-free random networks, Phys A Stat Mech Appl, 272, 1, pp. 173-187, (1999); Bass F.M., A new product growth for model consumer durables, Manag Sci, 15, 5, pp. 215-227, (1969); Berger T., Agent-based spatial models applied to agriculture: a simulation tool for technology diffusion, resource use changes and policy analysis, Agric Econ, 25, 2-3, pp. 245-260, (2001); Berger T., Birner R., Mccarthy N., DiAz J., Wittmer H., Capturing the complexity of water uses and water users within a multi-agent framework, Water Resour Manag, 21, 1, pp. 129-148, (2007); Bishop C.M., Pattern recognition and machine learning, (2006); Bonchi F., Influence propagation in social networks: a data mining perspective, IEEE Intell Inform Bull, 12, 1, pp. 8-16, (2011); Borshchev A., Filippov A., From system dynamics and discrete event to practical agent based modeling: Reasons, techniques, tools, International Conference of the System Dynamics Society, Citeseer, 22, (2004); Briegel R., Ernst A., Holzhauer S., Klemm D., Krebs F., Pinanez A.M., Social-Ecological Modelling with Lara: A Psychologically Well-Founded Lightweight Agent Architecture, (2012); Broekhuizen T.L., Delre S.A., Torres A., Simulating the cinema market: how cross-cultural differences in social influence explain box office distributions, J Prod Innov Manag, 28, 2, pp. 204-217, (2011); Brown D.G., Page S., Riolo R., Zellner M., Rand W., Path dependence and the validation of agent-based spatial models of land use, Int J Geogr Inf Sci, 19, 2, pp. 153-174, (2005); Carley K.M., Validating Computational Models, (1996); Chandrasekaran D., Tellis G.J., A critical review of marketing research on diffusion of new products, Rev Market Res, 3, 1, pp. 39-80, (2007); Chica M., Rand W., Building agent-based decision support systems for word-of-mouth programs: a freemium application, J Market Res, (2017); Dawid H., Agent-based models of innovation and technological change, Handb Comput Econ, 2, pp. 1235-1272, (2006); Deffuant G., Neau D., Amblard F., Weisbuch G., Mixing beliefs among interacting agents, Adv Complex Syst, 3, 01n04, pp. 87-98, (2000); Deffuant G., Amblard F., Weisbuch G., Faure T., How can extremism prevail?

Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on discussions in the workshop on “Fresh perspectives on technology in service” at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings – We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value – Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored. We provide a fresh perspective on service research by characterizing relevant aspects of smart service that will stimulate fruitful future research and advance the understanding and practice of smart services. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Connected services; Intelligent object; New service type; Smart services","","","","","","","","Allmendinger G., Lombreglia R., Four strategies for the age of smart services, Harvard Business Review, 83, 10, pp. 131-145, (2005); Baines T., Lightfoot H., Smart P., Servitization within manufacturing: exploring the provision of advanced services and their impact on vertical integration, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 2, 7, pp. 947-954, (2011); Bastl M., Johnson M., Lightfoot H., Evans S., Buyer supplier relationships in a servitized environment, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 30, 6, pp. 650-675, (2012); Biehl M., Prater E., McIntyre J.R., Remote repair, diagnostics, and maintenance, Communications of the ACM, 47, 11, pp. 100-106, (2004); Brax S.A., Jonsson K., Developing integrated solution offerings for remote diagnostics a comparative case study of two manufacturers, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 29, 5, pp. 539-560, (2009); Keh H.T., Pang J., Customer reactions to service separation, Journal of Marketing, 74, 2, pp. 55-71, (2010); Meuter M.L., Bitner M.J., Ostrom A.L., Brown S.W., Choosing among alternative service delivery modes: an investigation of customer trial of self-service technologies, Journal of Marketing, 69, 2, pp. 61-83, (2005); Mick D.G., Fournier S., Paradoxes of technology: consumer cognizance, emotions, and coping strategies, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 2, pp. 123-143, (1998); Norman D.A., The Design of Future Things, (2007); Paluch S., Blut M., Service separation and customer satisfaction: assessing the service separation/customer integration paradox, Journal of Service Research, 16, 3, pp. 415-427, (2013); Porter M.E., Heppelmann J.E., How smart, connected products are transforming competition, Harvard Business Review, 92, 11, pp. 64-88, (2014); Prahalad C.K., Ramaswamy V., The Future of Competition: Co-Creating Unique Value with Customers, (2004); Reinartz W., Ulaga W., How to sell services more profitably, Harvard Business Review, 86, 5, pp. 90-96, (2008); Rixon L., Hirani S.P., Cartwright M., Beynon M., Selva A., Sanders C., Newman S.P., What influences withdrawal because of rejection of telehealth-the whole systems demonstrator evaluation, Journal of Assistive Technologies, 7, 4, pp. 219-227, (2013); Rust R.T., Huang M.-H., The service revolution and the transformation of marketing science, Marketing Science, 33, 2, pp. 206-221, (2014); Schumann J.H., Wunderlich N.V., Wangenheim F.V., Technology mediation in service delivery: a new typology and an agenda for managers and academics, Technovation, 32, 2, pp. 133-143, (2012); Steinke F., Ingenhoff A., Fritsch T., Personal remote assistance in ambient assisted living-experimental research of elderly people’s trust and their intention to use, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 30, 7, pp. 560-574, (2014); Tian K., Sautter P., Fisher D., Fischbach S., Luna-Nevarez C., Boberg K., Kroger J., Vann R., Transforming health-care: empowering therapeutic communities through technology-enhanced narratives, Journal of Consumer Research, 41, 2, pp. 237-260, (2014); Viana R., Patricio L., Service design for sustainability: developing transformative services for home energy consumption, pp. 1-19, (2012); Wunderlich N.V., Wangenheim F.V., Bitner M.J., High tech and high touch: a framework for understanding user attitudes and behaviors related to smart interactive services, Journal of Service Research, 16, 1, pp. 3-20, (2013); Zeithaml V.A., Brown S.W., Bitner M.J., Salas J., Profiting from Services and Solutions: What Product-Centric Firms Need to Know, (2014)","N.V.

The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency. Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard. © 2023 The Authors","Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical system; Driverless cars; Governance; Laws","Accidents, Traffic; Autonomous Vehicles; Communication; Computer Security; Humans; Intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Cyber Physical System; Data privacy; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Knowledge management; Network security; Personal computing; Automated vehicles; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Driverless cars; Governance; Law; Regulatory frameworks; Service provider; autonomous vehicle; computer security; human; intelligence; interpersonal communication; prevention and control; traffic accident; Dynamics","","","","","","","(2020); Aryee D., (2020); Bansal P., Kockelman K.M., Forecasting Americans’ long-term adoption of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies, Transportation Research Part A: Policy Practice, 95, pp. 49-63, (2017); Bartl M., The future of autonomous driving–introducing the foresight matrix to support strategic planning, The making of Innovation, pp. 1-7, (2015); Bridgelall R., Stubbing E., Forecasting the effects of autonomous vehicles on land use, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2021); (2022); Channon M., Marson J., THE liability for cybersecurity breaches of connected and autonomous vehicles, Computer Law Security Review, 43, (2021); Chapple M., Stewart J.M., Gibson D., (ISC) 2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, (2018); Choi K.-S., Lee C.S., Louderback E.R., Historical Evolutions of Cybercrime: From Computer Crime to Cybercrime, The Palgrave Handbook of International Cybercrime Cyberdeviance, pp. 27-43, (2020); (2021); Dimitriadis A., Ivezic N., Kulvatunyou B., Mavridis I., D4I-Digital forensics framework for reviewing and investigating cyber attacks, Array, 5, (2020); Dukarski J., Unsettled Legal Issues Facing Data in Autonomous, Connected, Electric, and Shared Vehicles, (2021); Elzen B., Geels F.W., Green K., System innovation and the transition to sustainability: theory, evidence and policy, (2004); Enisa, Good practices for security of Smart Cars, (2019); Fagnant D.J., Kockelman K., Preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles: opportunities, barriers and policy recommendations, Transportation Research Part A: Policy Practice, 77, pp. 167-181, (2015); Harper C.D., Hendrickson C.T., Mangones S., Samaras C., Estimating potential increases in travel with autonomous vehicles for the non-driving, elderly and people with travel-restrictive medical conditions, Transportation research part C: emerging technologies, 72, pp. 1-9, (2016); Hidalgo A., Albors J., Innovation management techniques and tools: a review from theory and practice, R & D Management, 38, 2, pp. 113-127, (2008); Hirsch G.B., Levine R., Miller R.L., Using system dynamics modeling to understand the impact of social change initiatives, American Journal of community psychology, 39, 3, pp. 239-253, (2007); Hodge C., Hauck K., Gupta S., Bennett J.C., (2019); Ilkova V., Ilka A., Legal aspects of autonomous vehicles—An overview, 2017 21st international conference on process control (PC), IEEE, pp. 428-433, (2017); Iso, ISO Road Vehicles Functional Safety Part_1: Standard ISO 26262–1, (2018); Kent A.D., Cyber security data sources for dynamic network research, Dynamic Networks and Cyber-Security.

The aim of this study was to segment farmers based on their purchasing behavior for crop protection products and to examine segment-specific characteristics in the digital environment. A cluster analysis of 590 German farm managers was used to identify five distinctive buyer segments based on five characteristics: dealer, brand and service orientation, price affinity and autonomous decision making. The results demonstrate that farmers place high value on personal contacts to stationary suppliers when purchasing crop protection products. Service orientation turned out to be a strong mediator of segment membership, while price and product brand are secondary to farmer segmentation. However, traditional typologies are only suitable for the digitization topic to a limited extent, as digital search and information behavior hardly differs. Even though digital information procurement is becoming increasingly interesting for all segments, an openness to e-commerce applies only to a small group of independent buyers. Concerning e-commerce attitudes, the perception of its advantages and the lack of personal contact differentiates the clusters the most. The results contribute to the scientific understanding of farmers’ information and purchasing behavior and provide initial approaches for the development of customer-centric corporate marketing strategies. © 2022 Schulze Schwering et al.","Agri-chemical; Cluster analysis; Farm inputs; Omni-channel; Purchasing behavior","","","","","","Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, KAS","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS).","Ackermann S., Adams I., Gindele N., Doluschitz R., The role of e-commerce in the purchase of agricultural input materials, Landtechnik, 73, 1, pp. 10-19, (2018); German crop protection market down 7.4% in 2018, (2020); Alexander C.E., Wilson C.A., Foley D.H., Agricultural input market segments: who is buying what?, Journal of Agribusiness, 23, pp. 113-132, (2005); Ardrey J., Denis N., Magnin C., Revellat J., Unlocking the online retail opportunity with European farmers, (2020); Backhaus K., Erichson B., Plinke W., Weiber R., Multivariate analysemethoden.

The modeler requires to validate the model by checking the parameter values before the model can be used and this task is very challenging when the model considers two or more conflicting outputs. We propose a multicriteria integral framework to assist the modeler in the calibration and validation of agent-based models that combines evolutionary multiobjective optimization with network-based visualization, which we believe is the first integral approach to model calibration. On the one hand, evolutionary multiobjective optimization provides several sets of calibration solutions (i.e., parameter values) with different trade-offs for the considered objectives in a single run. On the other hand, network-based visualization is used to better understand the decision space and the set of solutions from the obtained Pareto set approximation. To illustrate our proposal, we face the calibration of three agent-based model examples for marketing which consider two conflicting criteria: the awareness of the brand and its word-of-mouth volume. The final analysis of the calibrated solutions shows how our proposed framework eases the analysis of Pareto sets with high cardinality and helps with the identification of flexible solutions (i.e., those having close values in the design space). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Information visualization; Model calibration","Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Economic and social effects; Information systems; Pareto principle; Simulation platform; Visualization; Agent-based model; Automated calibration; Calibration and validations; Calibration solutions; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; First integral; Information visualization; Model calibration; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (PGC2018-101216-B-I00); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (RYC-2016-19800); Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España, MINECO","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad under the EXASOCO project (ref.

We investigate a multidimensional structure of brand coolness and show how it mediates the effects of product quality on word of mouth communication and on intentions to buy/use cool brands. We also demonstrate under what conditions brand coolness influences WOM and intentions. The self-concept, rooted in materialism and expressed as the desire to impress other people and to compare oneself to others so as to emulate them, serves to regulate the effects of brand coolness in a negative way on WOM and intentions, thereby fulfilling the autonomous function of brand coolness for consumers described in the past as one important aspect of brand coolness. In order to show the incremental contribution of brand coolness in predicting WOM and decisions to buy/use cool brands, the effects of brand coolness are tested in head-to-head comparisons with the influence of self-brand connections and attitudes toward cool brands, which are classically studied brand drivers, on a representative sample of 400 adult Americans aged 20–40 years inclusive. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997);

However, in structurally connected organization configurations, the literature focuses mainly on one of the functional unit's reputations (either subordinate or superordinate organization), leaving out the interplay of reputation among various units in the organization. Drawing on identity and categorization theories, we develop a framework to examine the effects of brand reputation at both levels. Our study context is higher education, where business schools (subordinate) operate as autonomous entities globally yet are dependent on universities (superordinate) for policy decisions. We specify a random effects model on a 10-year panel dataset of 193 business schools to account for unobserved heterogeneity, potential selection bias, and endogeneity of reputation. Our findings suggest that brand reputation attributes at the subordinate and superordinate levels both individually and synergistically affect subordinate funding outcomes (i.e., business-school endowment). Furthermore, subordinate-level resource-utilization signals, such as diversification strategies and top executives' backgrounds, and superordinate-level policy signals, such as organization ownership and inclusivity, inform donor decisions and moderate the reputation–funding relationship. Our study suggests that administrators and managers should consider donor identity salience in marketing efforts. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Brand identity salience; Categorization theory; Higher education; Information signals; Organizational reputation","","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Kwon S.-W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept, Academy of Management Review, 27, 1, pp. 17-40, (2002); Adner R., Helfat C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 10, pp. 1011-1025, (2003); Ahmed A., Types of workplace diversity, Bizfluent, (2018); Ailawadi K.L., Lehmann D.R., Neslin S.A., Revenue premium as an outcome measure of brand equity, Journal of Marketing, 67, 4, pp. 1-17, (2003); Anderson S.J., Chandy R., Zia B., Pathways to profits: The impact of marketing vs. finance skills on business performance, Management Science, 64, 12, pp. 5559-5583, (2018); Arnett D.B., German S.D., Hunt S.D., The identity salience model of relationship marketing success: The case of nonprofit marketing, Journal of Marketing, 67, 2, pp. 89-105, (2003); Arpan L.M., Raney A.A., Zivnuska S., A cognitive approach to understanding university image, Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 8, 2, pp. 97-113, (2003); Ashforth B.E., Mael F., Social identity theory and the organization, Academy of Management Review, 14, 1, pp. 20-39, (1989); Audia P.G., Greve H.R., Less likely to fail: Low performance, firm size, and factory expansion in the shipbuilding industry, Management Science, 52, 1, pp. 83-94, (2006); Bachmann R., Ehrlich G., Fan Y., Ruzic D., Leard B., Firms and collective reputation: A study of the volkswagen emissions scandal, Journal of the European Economic Association, 21, 2, pp. 484-525, (2023); Balachander S., Ghose S., Reciprocal spillover effects: A strategic benefit of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 67, 1, pp. 4-13, (2003); Baltagi B., Econometric analysis of panel data, (2008); Barsalou L.W., Context-independent and context-dependent information in concepts, Memory & Cognition, 10, 1, pp. 82-93, (1982); Beach L.R., Image theory: Personal and organizational decisions.

Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service","","","","","","Groningen Digital Business Center","The authors wish to convey their appreciation to the special issue editors Nicolai Fabian, Evert de Haan, and in particular thank Arnd Vomberg as the editor of this paper for his insightful and valuable inputs and constructive feedback during the entire review process.

These expected benefits will not be presented if parents are not willing to use AVs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore parents’ intentions of using AVs to transport children to and from school (parents’ intentions). This study has two primary aims: 1) Exploring parents’ intentions and their potential determinants. 2) Making recommendations for manufacturers to develop and market AVs suitable for school travel based on the research results. Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents’ intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents’ intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents’ intentions. The direct impact of perceived ease of use and public engagement on parents’ intentions is not significant. Finally, this research could provide decision-making support for governments and manufacturers to formulate relevant policies and marketing strategies, promoting parents’ acceptance of AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; Parents’ intentions; School travel; Travel safety","Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Attitude; Child; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Robotics; Schools; Young Adult; Commerce; Decision making; Marketing; Safety factor; Autonomous Vehicles; Chinese characteristics; Direct impact; Parent’ intention; Perceived ease-of-use; Perceived risk; Perceived usefulness; Research results; School travels; Travel safety; adult; attitude; behavior; child; child parent relation; decision making; female; human; male; middle aged; prevention and control; psychology; robotics; school; traffic accident; young adult; Autonomous vehicles","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71871107)","The authors want to express their gratitude to all the workmates of the research for their helpful suggestions and patient guidance.

During stagnation, reorientation policies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of those effects in order to reduce the prevalence of seasonality. Various planning instruments have been designed and implemented by successive local governments, a key priority being the attempt to find a strategic answer to reducing this phenomenon. Based on the analysis of successive marketing plans of the Autonomous Region of the Balearic Islands, and using the Gini index to measure seasonality, this study explores the link between the two and demonstrates that regional political policies adopted over the last 20 years have not reduced seasonal variation in tourism. The demand remains at the same levels of seasonality as in the 1990s, suggesting the ineffectiveness of the policies implemented.","Balearic Islands.; Marketing plan; Seasonality; Tourism destination","Balearic Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Spain; decision making; local government; policy implementation; political integration; seasonal variation; seasonality; tourism; tourism market; tourist destination","","","","","","","Aguil E., Una panormica de la Economa del Turismo en Espaa, Cuadernos de Economa, 33, 91, pp. 5-42, (2011); Aguil E., Rossell J., Host community perceptions.

Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics","Artificial intelligence; Environmental management; Location; Product design; Purchasing; Sales; Autonomous learning; Consumer evaluation; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Environmental problems; Environmental sustainability; Hierarchical linear modeling; Need for cognitions; Sustainable development","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16K13396, 19K21707, 20H01554); Waseda University, (2019C-152)","The author is grateful to all survey respondents and to Yang Yang and Shan Zheng for their contributions to the data collection.

However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs)","","","","","","","","Sofla M.S., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Mirzaee R.F., Towards Effective Offloading Mechanisms in Fog Computing, Multimed.

They do so directly through product innovation strategies (food manufacturers) and the selection of products available in stores (grocers and restaurants) and indirectly through distribution and promotion strategies and prices. Decisions to alter products, menus, assortments and marketing strategies are drivers of supply, which interact with consumer demand to impact the nutritional quality of food available, purchased and eventually consumed. The sequence of managerial decisions leading to product-level marketing mixes is explored. This case-study provides a comparison of monitored industry self-regulation of trans fat (Canada primarily) and more autonomous firm strategy (US primarily) on the nutrient quality of new cookies launched between 2006-12. Cookies were selected for this case-study given that they are commonly consumed and have traditionally contained trans fat. Differences between food labeling policies in the US and Canada are then compared to explore the merits of a conceptual model. © 2014 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).","Adoption; Assimilation; Food reformulation; Public health","","","","","","","","Albers M.J., Harnack L.J., Steffen L.M., Jacobs D.R., 2006 Marketplace survey of trans-fatty acid content of margarines and butters, cookies and snack cakes, and savory snacks, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 108, pp. 367-370, (2008); Cohen D.A., Scribner R.A., Farley T.A., A Structural Model of Health Behavior: A Pragmatic Approach to Explain and Influence Health Behaviors at the Population Level, Preventative Medicine, 30, pp. 146-154, (2000); Cooper R.B., Zmud R.W., Information Technology implementation research: A technological diffusion approach, Management Science, 36, 2, pp. 123-139, (1990); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P.R., User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); Downs S.M., Thow A.M., Leeder S.R., The effectiveness of policies for reducing dietary trans fat: a systematic review of the evidence, Bulletin World Health Organization, 4, pp. 262-269, (2013); Eckel R.H., Borra S., Lichtenstein A.H., Yin-Piazza S.Y., Understanding the Complexity of Trans Fatty Acid Reduction in the American Diet American Heart Association Trans Fat Conference 2006 Report of the Trans Fat Conference Planning Group, Circulation, 115, 16, pp. 2231-2246, (2007); Eckel R.H., Kris-Etherton P., Lichtenstein A.H., Wylie-Rosett J., Groom A., Stitzel K.F., Yin-Piazza S., Americans' awareness, knowledge, and behaviors regarding fats: 2006-2007, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 109, 2, pp. 288-296, (2009); Flickinger B.D., Huth P.J., Dietary fats and oils: technologies for improving cardiovascular health, Current Atherosclerosis Reports, 6, pp. 468-476, (2004); Guidance for Industry: Trans Fatty Acids in Nutrition Labeling, Nutrient Content Claims, Health Claims; Small Entity Compliance Guide, (2003); Tentative Determination Regarding Partially Hydrogenated Oils; Request for Comments and for Scientific Data and Information, Federal Register, 78, 217, pp. 67169-67175, (2013); (2006); Henson S., Heasman M., Food Safety, Regulation and the Firm: Understanding the Compliance Process.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of consumer selection for purchasing channel and the corresponding influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,976 valid questionnaires were collected by convenience sampling from 34 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China in 2020 via the Internet, yielding a response rate of 82.2%. A categorical statistical approach was used to understand consumer's selection for each channel. Besides, binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors affecting consumers' channel selection. Findings: The results show that Chinese wine consumers' main purchasing channels are as follows: supermarket/mall, wine specialty stores, comprehensive e-business flagship stores, comprehensive e-business individual stores, restaurants and short video and live streaming platforms. Estimation results showed that among the 12 influencing factors in 4 categories, consumers' education and some other factors significantly influenced consumers' decision on wine purchasing channels. Research limitations/implications: Limited by time and experimental conditions, this study did not analyze the trend of wine consumers' purchasing channel selection. Future work would concentrate on multi-year data and conduct longitudinal comparative analysis. Originality/value: This study innovatively subdivides the currently popular wine sales channels in Chinese market and conducts research related to consumer channel selection.

This paper raises the issue of risk communication versus advertising and argues that in order to better understand consumers' response to food risk communication we should pay closer attention to the broader information environment in which the compromised foodstuffs are embedded. Any new information properly crafted in the form of ""risk messages"" necessarily interacts with the information that constitutes the foodstuff's environment. It is proposed that focusing on such an environment, rather than on the ""content"" of the risk message alone, improves understanding of how the risk message eventually triggers further selections and decisions about the compromised foodstuff. The risk communication is itself a media event and is seen as part of the food information environment rather than autonomous to it.","Consumers; Food; Marketing; Risk communication; The media","Food processing; Food products; Marketing; Consumers; Intermittent foods; Nutritional advice; Risk communication; Risk management","","","","","","","Fife-Shaw C., Rowe G., Public perceptions of everyday food hazards: A psychometric study, Risk Analysis, 164, pp. 487-500, (1996); Frewer L.J., Howard C., Hedderley D., Shepherd R., The elaboration likelihood model and communication about food risks, Risk Analysis, 17, 6, pp. 759-770, (1997); Frewer L.J., Howard C., Hedderley D., Shepherd R., Methodological Approaches to Assessing Risk Perceptions Associated with Food-Related Hazards, Risk Analysis, 18, 1, pp. 95-102, (1998); Goffman E., Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organisation of Experience, (1974); Hartley J., Popular Reality: Journalism, Modernity, Popular Culture, (1996); Kahneman D., Tversky A., Prospect theory.

How to balance the conflicts between ecosystem protection and ecosystem services consumption by local residents has been a serious challenge, especially in ecologically vulnerable areas. To explore the reasonable ecosystem services consumption approaches of grassland ecosystems for sustainable land system management, this study takes Hulun Buir of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a case study region and develops an EcoC-G (ecological consumption of grassland) model based on herders' livelihood behaviors using the agent-based model technique to simulate the dynamics of ecosystem pressure, livestock production, and living quality of herders under different grassland management scenarios over the next 30 years. The EcoC-G model links the supply and consumption of grassland ecosystem services by calculating the ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) supply and household NPP consumption. The model includes three sub-models, namely, the individual status transferring sub-model, the households' grassland-use decision sub-model, and the ecosystem pressure sub-model. In accordance with multi-objective grassland management practices, the following four land management scenarios were simulated: (1) baseline scenario, (2) increasing household's living standard, (3) ecosystem protection, and (4) balancing living standard improvement with the protection of the ecosystem. The result indicates that by focusing on the NPP supply and consumption of the grassland ecosystem, the EcoC-G is capable of simulating the impacts of herders' livelihood behaviors on grassland ecosystems. If timely grassland management strategies are implemented, it is possible to relieve the ecosystem pressure and improve the livelihood of local herders. The specific scenario simulation results are: (1) Under the current grassland management mode, the pasture could never be overgrazed, and herders could achieve the basic living standard, but the accumulated wealth decreased due to the decline of livestock. (2) With grazing control, herders can accumulate wealth by increasing the breeding amount and reducing the marketing rate, but the ecosystem consumption pressure can reach a maximum of 2.3 times. (3) With strict restrictions on the livestock number, the pressure on the ecosystem decreases; however, herders might not achieve basic living standards. (4) Modest regulation leads to rational ecological consumption intervals, meaning the ecosystem pressure will become stable and herders can gradually accumulate wealth with the achievement of basic living standards in advance. © 2019 by the authors.","Agent-based modeling (ABM); Ecosystem pressure; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem services consumption; Net primary productivity","China; Hulun Buir Desert; Nei Monggol; decision making; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; environmental protection; grassland; land management; livestock; living standard; net primary production; pasture; sustainability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (20141101001, 41671517); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA23100202); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Funding: This research was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, grant number XDA23100202, National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41671517, and Cooperation Project Between the Academy and the Local Government, grant number 20141101001.","The UNEPWorld Conservation Monitoring Centre; Global Footprint Network Living Planet Report 2004, (2004); Nelleman C., Corcoran E., Dead Planet, Living Planet: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Restoration for Sustainable Development-A Rapid Response Assessment, (2010); Stone R., Fragile ecosystems under pressure, Science, 349, pp. 1046-1047, (2015); The State of the World's Land and Water Resources for Food and Agriculture (SOLAW)-Managing Systems at Risk, (2011); Orr B.J., Cowie A.L., Sanchez V.M.C., Chasek P., Crossman N.D., Erlewein A., Louwagie G., Maron M., Metternicht G.I., Minelli S., Scientific Conceptual Framework for Land Degradation Neutrality, (2017); Xue Z., Zhen L., Impact of rural land transfer on land use functions inWestern China's Guyuan based on a multi-level stakeholder assessment framework, Sustainability, 10, (2018); Zhang G., Tao J., Dong J., Xu X., Spatiotemporal variations in thermal growing seasons due to climate change in Eastern Inner Mongolia during the period 1960-2010, Resour.

Personal genome tests estimate genetic susceptibilities to multiple diseases and other phenotypic traits simultaneously. Providers commonly make use of Terms of Service agreements rather than informed consent procedures. However, to protect consumers from the potential physical, psychological and social harms associated with personal genome testing and to promote autonomous decision-making with regard to the testing offer, we argue that current practices of information provision are insufficient and that there is a place - and a need - for informed consent in personal genome testing, also when it is offered commercially. The increasing quantity, complexity and diversity of most testing offers, however, pose challenges for information provision and informed consent. Both specific and generic models for informed consent fail to meet its moral aims when applied to personal genome testing. Consumers should be enabled to know the limitations, risks and implications of personal genome testing and should be given control over the genetic information they do or do not wish to obtain. We present the outline of a new model for informed consent which can meet both the norm of providing sufficient information and the norm of providing understandable information. The model can be used for personal genome testing, but will also be applicable to other, future forms of broad genetic testing or screening in commercial and clinical settings. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Autonomy;

At the same time, in larger firms, innovation often takes place in distinct units that are semi-autonomous and that have the responsibility for more than one phase in the product development process. In the most extreme case, a separate profit center is created within which research and development (R&D), production, marketing, and related activities are fully integrated and that has its own responsibility for external relations: an internal innovative venture. The central issue in this paper is the relation between the way firms organize their innovative activities and the market dynamics caused by bandwagon and network effects. We focus on the decision-making actors and we propose a categorization of causes of increasing returns and definitions of bandwagon and network effects that are consistent with this aim. We investigate the extent of internal autonomy of the unit, the extent of the integration of R&D, marketing and other activities in the product development process, and the extent of external autonomy. Three cases of projects creating software products, two of them in the same firm, demonstrate that the organization of innovation and the dynamics of the market are mutually dependent. More in particular, we hold that higher autonomy of teams, particularly in managing external relations, is important to cope with and manage bandwagon and network effects.","Autonomy of project teams; Bandwagon effects; Increasing returns; Network effects; Organization of innovation","Economics; Information technology; Internet; Marketing; Product development; Research and development management; Central hypothesis; Software firms; Software products; Computer software","","","","","","","Abrahamson E., Rosenkopf L., Social network effects on the extent of innovation diffusion: A computer simulation, Org.

We make two major methodological contributions. First, a novel one (SAV)-to-many (riders) matching is proposed to characterize the waiting times of an SAV and multiple travelers who share rides in the SAV during online matching, which is a nontrivial generalization of the one-to-one matching without ridesharing. Our matching characterization considers the possibilities of a traveler matched with an SAV starting from the same origin, whereto the SAV moved unoccupied as a result of either pickup or relocation, or with an in-service SAV that goes through the traveler's origin. Second, a section-based formulation for SAV ridesharing user equilibrium is introduced to characterize the SAV traveler flow, which accommodates the possibility that an SAV traveler's itinerary (OD pair) is different from that of the serving SAV and other travelers in the SAV. Unlike the existing link and route based ridesharing formulations, the notion of section both prevents undesired traveler en-route transfer(s) and allows travelers of multiple ODs to share rides, meanwhile respecting the SAV seat capacity constraint. In addition to the above two methodological contributions, the optimal SAV fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation (to in-service, pickup, and relocation states) decisions of a transportation network company (TNC) are formulated. The TNC decisions anticipate traveler reactions as characterized by a new multimodal autonomous ridesharing user equilibrium (MARUE), which is put forward with a proof of its existence and finds the endogenous market shares and road congestion effects of SAV/HV. Original insights are obtained from model implementation, including substantial systemwide benefit of ridesharing, marginal benefit of relocation in the presence of ridesharing, and diminishing economies of SAV size. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Endogenous market share; Network congestion; One-to-many matching; Section-based ridesharing equilibrium; Shared autonomous vehicle","Autonomous vehicles; Commerce; Fleet operations; Pickups; Traffic congestion; Autonomous Vehicles; Endogenous market share; Market share; Matchings; Network congestions; One-to-many matching; Ride-sharing; Section-based; Section-based ridesharing equilibrium; Shared autonomous vehicle; marketing; network analysis; public transport; traffic congestion; travel behavior; unmanned vehicle; Competition","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF 2112650)","This research was funded in part by the US National Science Foundation (NSF 2112650 ).

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer’s perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers’ intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Antecedents;

Binary or dichotomous data are widely spread across various fields of research - in decision making and data mining, marketing, solving of many natural, social and technical problems. The initial data for building the model is a set of states of an autonomous dynamical system with components taking binary values. At the same time, the time order of the states is permissible. The following objectives were stated: to identify the relationships between the components of the system defining its dynamics; on the basis of the identified dynamics, to recover the true order of the system states; to apply the developed model to the problem of visual identification of cyanobacteria in water areas using digital photography. To solve the problem, we used a mathematical model that enables to describe the relationships between components and transitions between the system states at a simple-forunderstanding level. The principle of parsimony underlies the model. According to this principle, the most appropriate model is described by the simplest relations in the sense defined in the work. As the case study, the problem of recognizing clumps of cyanobacteria from digital satellite imagery was considered. This is a complex, practically important problem that does not have a satisfactory experimental and theoretical solution at the moment. Applying system approaches to the measured colorimetric parameters of digital photography, we developed the index for identification of such clumps. This index uses the parameters of the digital RGB model of (various parts of) an image and allows us to reveal clumps of cyanobacteria on digital images obtained by aerospace methods. Additionally, digital photography can be performed in the conditions of insufficient visibility (due to precipitation, fog, and other factors), for imitation of which in the case study the original image was distorted by the digital noise. The studied model can find useful applications in the areas requiring binary dynamical data insights. © K. Nosov, G. Zholtkevych, M. Georgiyants, O. Vysotska, Y. Balym, A.

Technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and micro-array based analysis enable genome-wide testing for many heterogeneous abnormalities and predispositions simultaneously. This may challenge the feasibility of providing adequate pre-test information and achieving autonomous decision-making. At a symposium held at the 11th World Congress of Bioethics in June 2012 (Rotterdam), organized by the International Association of Bioethics, these challenges were presented for three different areas in which these so-called 'new genetics' technologies are increasingly being applied: newborn screening, prenatal screening strategies and commercial personal genome testing. In this article, we build upon the existing ethical framework for a responsible set-up of testing and screening offers and reinterpret some of its criteria in the light of the new genetics. As we will argue, the scope of a responsible testing or screening offer should align with the purpose(s) of testing and with the principle of respect for autonomy for all stakeholders involved, including (future) children. Informed consent is a prerequisite but requires a new approach. We present preliminary and general directions for an individualized or differentiated set-up of the testing offer and for the informed consent process. With this article we wish to contribute to the formation of new ideas on how to tackle the issues of autonomy and informed consent for (public) healthcare and direct-to-consumer applications of the new genetics. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer genetic testing; Informed consent; Neonatal screening; New genetics; Personal genome testing; Prenatal screening","Choice Behavior; Congresses as Topic; Consumer Satisfaction; Decision Making; Genetic Testing; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Informed Consent; Marketing of Health Services; Neonatal Screening; Personal Autonomy; Prenatal Diagnosis; article; consumer; decision making; economics; ethics; financial management; genetic screening; genomics; human; human genome; informed consent; methodology; newborn; newborn screening; organization; personal autonomy; prenatal diagnosis","","","","","","","Davies K., (2010); de Jong A., Et al., Advances in Prenatal Screening: The Ethical Dimension, Nat Rev Genet, 9, pp. 657-663, (2011); Solomon B.D., Et al., Applying Genomic Analysis to Newborn Screening, Mol Syndromol, 3, pp. 59-67, (2012); Tarini B.A., Goldenberg A.J., Ethical Issues with Newborn Screening in the Genomics Era, Ann Rev Genom Hum Genet, 13, pp. 381-393, (2012); Collins F.S., The Language of Life: DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine, (2010); Genomics P.; Dondorp W., de Wert G., (2010); Brownsword R., Beyleveld D., Consent in the Law, (2007); Faden R.R., Beauchamp T.L., A History and Theory of Informed Consent, (1986); Wertz D., Fletcher J., Berg K.; Kaariainen H., Et al., (2008); Khoury M.J., Burke W., Thomson E.J., Genetics and Public Health in the 21st Century: Using Genetic Information to Improve Health and Prevent Disease, (2000); Wilson J.M., Jungner Y.G., Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease, (1968); Ross L.F., Screening For Conditions that Do Not Meet the Wilson and Jungner Criteria: The Case of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Am J Med Genet, 140, pp. 914-922, (2006); Nijsingh N., Informed Consent and the Expansion of Newborn Screening.

Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications: This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value: While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment. © 2024, Myriam Quinones, Jaime Romero, Anne Schmitz and Ana M.

Research on AV trust has centered on trust in vehicle performance. However, trust evaluation may include AV manufacturers and developers, and regulation pertaining to AVs; thus, we expand our measurement of trust to include beliefs based on manufacturers and regulation. In this experiment, we manipulate information regarding manufacturer focus (i.e., an emphasis on standards, regulations, and research (SRR) versus speed to market) to determine its effect on trust. When information focused on SRR, we found higher levels of trust in AV performance and in manufacturers, compared to when it focused on speed to market. In addition, information regarding passenger control (i.e., the ability to take over for the vehicle and to determine privacy settings) was manipulated to yield either high or low passenger control conditions. Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AVs was lowest when speed to market was emphasized and when passenger control was low. Furthermore, trust was tested as a mediator between perceived risk and BI. Trust in AV performance partially mediated the relationship between perceived AV performance risk and BI. In addition, trust in AV regulation partially mediated the relationship between AV privacy/security risk and BI. Researchers should continue to examine trust beyond the AV itself to encompass trust in manufacturers and regulations. Those designing and marketing AVs should carefully consider decisions that influence manufacturer/developer reputation and passenger control due to their effect on intention to use AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; Mental models; Passenger control; Perceived risk; Trust","Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Privacy by design; Vehicle performance; Behavioral intention; Intention to use; Perceived risk; Performance risk; Privacy Settings; Public acceptance; Speed-to-market; Trust evaluation; Autonomous vehicles","","","","","","","Acock A.C., Discovering structural equation modeling using Stata, (2013); Adnan N., Nordin S.M., (2018); (2010); Anania E.C., Rice S., Walters N.W., Pierce M., Winter S.R., Milner M.N., The effects of positive and negative information on consumers’ willingness to ride in a driverless vehicle, Transport Policy, 72, pp. 218-224, (2018); Anderson J.M., Kalra N., Stanley K.D., Sorensen P., Samaras C., Oluwatola O.A., Autonomous vehicle technology: A guide for policymakers, RAND Corporation., (2014); Angst C.M., Agarwal R., Adoption of electronic health records in the presence of privacy concerns: The elaboration likelihood model and individual persuasion, Management Information Systems Quarterly, 33, pp. 339-370, (2009); Bhattacherjee A., Individual trust in online firms: Scale development and initial test, Journal of Management Information Systems, 19, pp. 211-241, (2002); Beggiato M., Krems J.F., The evolution of mental model, trust and acceptance of adaptive cruise control in relation to initial information, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 18, pp. 47-57, (2013); Bigley G.A., Pearce J.L., Straining for shared meaning in organization science: Problems of trust and distrust, Academy of Management Review, 23, pp. 405-421, (1998); Brown T.A., Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research, (2015); Carlos Roca J., Garcia J., de la Vega J., The importance of perceived trust, security and privacy in online trading systems, Information Management & Computer Security, 17, pp. 96-113, (2009); Choi J.K., Ji Y.G., Investigating the Importance of Trust on Adopting an Autonomous Vehicle, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 31, pp. 692-702, (2015); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, pp. 982-1003, (1989); de Vries P., Midden C., Bouwhuis D., The effects of errors on system trust, self-confidence, and the allocation of control in route planning, Int.

We are, of course, talking about online social networks. Specifically, we focus on the organic products sector, which is also becoming of increasing importance to society, as reflected by the continuous development of the market and that of olive oil, in which Spain holds a position of some importance globally. Objectives Thus, the aim of this study is to focus on the analysis of the use of and penetration of these online tools within the organic olive business community, with special focus on the entities in the Social Economy, the vast majority of which are co-operative societies. Design The population studied consists of organic entities that are processors and marketers of olive oil in Andalusia, registered in the Sistema de Informacion de la Produccion Ecologica de la Junta de Andalucia (The Autonomous Government of Andalusia Organic Production Information System, SIPEA). A structured telephone survey was carried out on this population, specifically aimed at the management of these 'organic olive oil processing and marketing' entities, where information on the use and commitment of the organisation was collected by the ICTs. Also, a checkpoint was created containing key account metrics of the organisations with accounts in the online social networks Facebook and Twitter. Other detailed statistics are also included in this checkpoint, obtained from analysing these accounts with on-line tools specialised in online social networks such as LikeAlyzer and Twitonomy. Methodology To determine the impact and penetration of the ICT, descriptive statistics were utilised, and then, a more comprehensive analysis of online social networks was conducted using the DEA method (Data Envelopment Analysis). DEA methodology, both nonparametric and deterministic, aims to measure the efficiency of a set of homogeneous decision-making units (DMU) using linear programming to compare identical inputs and outputs, to obtain a ranking efficiency (Samoilenko, 2014). Specifically, the variables that determine the efficiency levels considered as inputs and outputs of the model are the main metrics obtained on the use and success of the organisations in online social networks. In this way, the main activity indicators that reveal the use and development of these tools by the organisations have been used as inputs. The main monitoring indicators, which reflect the popularity of these accounts in online social networks serve as the outputs. The high level of sensitivity of the DEA method to outliers makes this one of the main weaknesses of the method (Wilson, 1995). To solve this problem we have used the super-efficiency method, detecting and removing observations contaminated by noise, which produces more accurate results and a more accurate classification efficiency (Banker and Chang, 2006). Results In a first analysis of the use of ICT by organic olive organisations, it is observed that the existing differences between the two types of organisations, SCA and SAT as compared with other legal forms, are not relevant regarding the presence of a website or the use of e-commerce. In relation to the use of virtual social networks, 53.74 percent of organisational leaders confirm they make regular use of these platforms. Discriminating between entities of the social economy and other legal forms shows us that 37.50 percent of co-operative societies and SAT report using these platforms. This is in comparison to 61.62 percent of other legal forms, representing a more than 24 percentage point difference between the two groups. On the other hand, although capitalist entities make greater use of virtual social networks, on average, they are less efficient in their usage of such platforms, compared with organisations in the Social Economy. Thus, the results obtained after using the DEA method show us that, considering the variable returns to scale (BCC model), 76.92 percent of co-operative societies and SAT are more efficient in online social networks, compared to 23.08 percent of the remaining legal forms. This increased efficiency is also maintained in the CCR model. Therefore, and in line with other investigations, this confirms that co-operative societies and online SATs use online social networks in a way that is more geared towards transactional rather than relational purposes (Lopez et al., 2012; Montegut et al., 2013; Munoz and Tirado, 2014), although their social nature is advantageous for them on platforms such as online social networks. Conclusions The differences between entities belonging to the Social Economy and other legal forms with respect to the use of websites or online stores are not significant. However, it is confirmed that the organic olive co-operative entities and their SAT counterparts clearly lag in the use of online social networks. In general, these platforms are largely undervalued by the business community in this entire sector. The inflexibility of co-operative societies in adapting to the changing environment and, in particular, to technological changes (COGECA, 2010), is considered a clear explanatory factor in these results. This is due to increasing awareness of its importance as the business use of online social networks is a relatively recent phenomenon. According to Bridges et al. (2010), greater market orientation and integration of co-operative societies is necessary, which will stimulate the commitment to online social networks. Furthermore, the results show that the SCA and SAT are entities that are more efficient in their use of these online platforms. We believe the main supporting factor for this is the aforementioned confluence of values between the Social Economy and Web 2.0. The relevance of communication within co-operative societies (Herranz, 2007) has made the Internet an indispensable yet still underrated tool. In this sense, the singular operational methods and characteristics of these entities (Mozas et al., 2015), makes the use of online social networks, an economic, simple and affordable media, which could be extremely useful for them. Therefore, the social identity that co-operative societies present and transmit gives them an advantage in online media, which results in an extremely efficient method of achieving greater popularity with a lesser degree of effort. As the main limitation of the study addressed the sectoral nature of the investigation, this makes it difficult to generalise about all entities in the Social Economy. However, given the scarcity of related studies, this research is a clear starting point for extending the analysis to other industries and institutions such as co-operative societies of second degree and above. The timeliness and relevance of the issues addressed highlights the usefulness of this study.","DEA; Olive oil entities; Organic products; Social Economy; Social media","","","","","","","","Alberghini E., Cricelli L., Grimaldi M., A methodology to manage and monitor social media inside a company: A case study, Journal of Knowledge Management, 18, 2, pp. 255-277, (2014); Banker R.D., Chang H., The super-efficiency procedure for outlier identification, not for ranking efficient units, European Journal of Operational Research, 175, 2, pp. 1311-1320, (2006); Banker R.D., Gifford J.L., A relative efficiency model for the evaluation of public health nurse productivity, (1988); Bernabeu R., Olmeda M., Diaz M., Olivas R., Oportunidades comerciales para el aceite de oliva de Castilla-La Mancha, Grasas y Aceites, 60, pp. 525-533, (2009); Bernal E., Mozas A., Evaluación del uso comercial de la World Wide Web por parte de las cooperativas de segundo grado españolas, Revista Española de Estudios Agrosociales y Pesqueros, 219, pp. 181-200, (2008); Bilos A., Keli I., Marketing aspects of social networks, Ekonomska istraživanja, 2, pp. 155-174, (2012); Boulianne S., Social media use and participation: A meta-analysis of current research, Information, Communication & Society, 18, 5, pp. 524-538, (2015); Cheek R.G., Ferguson T., Tanner J., Consumer-Centric Strategic Social Media Plan for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, International Journal of Business and Social Research, 3, 1, pp. 1-11, (2013); Ciruela A.M., Cuadrado M., Análisis situacional del sector oleícola cooperativo andaluz.

Since the trade-in subsidy policy provided by government was canceled, companies have implemented trade-in on their own. As a method of competition, marketing strategy research pays more and more attention to trade-in, which shows many advantages such as benefiting the people, stimulating consumption and upgrading products. Currently, the studies of trade-in mainly focus on discussing the superiority when it is carried out by a single enterprise. The current study seldom analyzes trade-in systematically from supply chain perspective when it is implemented by different investors. In addition, whether an old customer buys a new product depends on the previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products. Existing studies have not considered the purchase decision characteristics of old customers. In this paper, the market is divided into two parts. One market is the new customer, and the other one is the old customer. The previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products are considered as two important factors when an old customer purchases a new product. This paper is based on the two-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer and a manufacturer. Trade-in policy implemented by retailer and manufacturer is constructed by considering customer utility to study strategic optimization of supply chain system. Firstly, decision-makings of supply chains of three strategic models are compared and analyzed to study their impact on customers. Secondly, the optimal path of supply chain strategy is provided and discussed from the perspective of business efficiency. Thirdly, the impact of market factors on supply chain efficiency of the optimal path adopted in the supply chain is discussed. Finally, by comparing consumer surpluses and social welfares of the three strategies, the social advantages of the adopted optimal path are studied. This study has four major research findings. First, trade-in strategy has a significant impact on product sales and corporate profits. The manufacturer or retailer can strive for greater profit by investing trade-in on his own initiative than before. That will be an obstacle to implementing trade-in strategy. Therefore, when making decisions the manufacturer should properly pay regard to the retailer, and then select a reasonable strategy according to the relationship between them, such as investing trade-in cooperatively. Second, whichever trade-in strategy is adopted in the market, external market (namely retail price, buy-back price, market demand and customer net utility remain stable. However, internal system (namely wholesale price) is obviously dependent on the investor. Third, trade-in strategy is difficult to benefit all parties under market segments. When it is beneficial to one side, it is bound to harm the other side. When the repurchase desire of old customer for a new product is small, the trade-in strategy can effectively strengthen the product stickiness of old customer; however, it can weaken the product's appeal to potential new customer. Fourth, in some cases trade-in strategy will reduce overall consumer surplus and total social welfare. Only when the old customer’s market share, the previous usage experience or the depreciation of old product is higher than a certain threshold, it can benefit all consumers and the society © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.","Consumer utility; Social welfare; Strategy optimization; Supply chain; Trade-In","","","","","","","","O'Rourke D., The science of sustainable supply chains, Science, 344, 6188, pp. 1124-1127, (2014); Jayaram J, Avittathur B., Green supply chains: A perspective from an emerging economy, International Journal of Production Economics, 164, 1, pp. 234-244, (2015); Lee KH, Shin D., Consumers5 responses to CSR activities: The linkage between increased awareness and purchase intention, Public Relations Review, 36, 2, pp. 193-195, (2010); U.K. government poised to offer scrapping incentive; may seek industry contribution[EB/OL], (2009); Adda J, Cooper R., Balladurette and Juppette: A discrete analysis of scrapping subsidies, Journal of Political Economy, 108, 4, pp. 778-806, (2000); Schweinfurth A., Car-scrapping schemes: an effective economic rescue policy[N]?

Many feel that DSO-managed group practices (DMGPs) with employed providers will become the setting in which the majority of oral health care will be delivered in the future. Viewpoint 1 asserts that the traditional dental practice patterns of the past are shifting as many younger dentists gravitate toward employed positions in large group practices or the public sector. Although educational debt is relevant in predicting graduates’ practice choices, other variables such as gender, race, and work-life balance play critical roles as well. Societal characteristics demonstrated by aging Gen Xers and those in the Millennial generation blend seamlessly with the opportunities DMGPs offer their employees. Viewpoint 2 contends the traditional model of dental care delivery—allowing entrepreneurial practitioners to make decisions in an autonomous setting—is changing but not to the degree nor as rapidly as Viewpoint 1 professes. Millennials entering the dental profession, with characteristics universally attributed to their generation, see value in the independence and flexibility that a traditional practice allows. Although DMGPs provide dentists one option for practice, several alternative delivery models offer current dentists and future dental school graduates many of the advantages of DMGPs while allowing them to maintain the independence and freedom a traditional practice provides. © American Dental Education Association","dental group practice; dentists; ownership; practice management; private practice; professional autonomy; professional practice location","Attitude of Health Personnel; Cohort Effect; Delivery of Health Care; Dental Care; Dentists; Entrepreneurship; Forecasting; Group Practice, Dental; Health Care Sector; Humans; Independent Practice Associations; Management Service Organizations; Ownership; Private Practice; Professional Autonomy; Professional Corporations; Public Sector; aging; article; dental education; dental procedure; dentist; employee; female; gender; group practice; human; male; management; marketing; occupation; organization; private practice; public sector; race; work-life balance; commercial phenomena; dental procedure; dentist; epidemiology; forecasting; group practice; health care cost; health care delivery; health insurance; health personnel attitude; hospital organization; organization and management; private practice; professional practice; psychology; trends","","","","","","","Toward a common goal: the role of dental support organizations in an evolving profession, (2014); Valachovic R.W., A dentist shortage?

However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency. © 2024 The Authors","Aeronautics; Artificial Intelligence; Benefits; Performance; Use cases","Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Predictive analytics; Air France; Artificial intelligence technologies; Benefit; Conceptual maps; Dassault Aviation; Easyjet; Performance; Scientific literature; Sequential approach; Use case; Efficiency","","","","","","","Ahmed R., Shaheen S., Philbin S.P., The role of big data analytics and decision-making in achieving project success, J.

This paper studies a triple-channel system in which a manufacturer operates a conventional channel, a direct online channel, as well as increases its online presence with an online shopping platform. It also takes the heterogeneity of consumers’ price sensitivity and channel preferences into account. It highlights that the perceived risks and perceived benefits are aggregated into an inhibitor or activator entering the customers’ acceptance of triple channels and further affecting their purchasing decisions. Three cases are discussed to investigate the demand distributions, the profit behaviours, the optimal pricing strategies and the channel selection strategies. Theoretical analysis is further validated by a case study with the aid of agent-based modelling. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that two acceptance indices – respectively, regarded as the consumers’ willingness to tolerate the perceived risks of the online channel and approve the perceived benefits from the third-party online platform – significantly govern the total profit in two stylised scenarios. This study schematically characterises the structure of demand distributions, helps the corporation to discern consumers’ channel choices and then focus its marketing efforts towards more profitable customers and strategic channel structures. Furthermore, some implications are outlined for the optimal supply chain designation decision. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agent-based simulation; Heterogeneous valuation;

Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Whereas the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human–machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human–computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey. The article finishes with implications for policy makers and a future research agenda for researchers examining autonomous technologies. © 2019 The Authors","Adoption barrier; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous technology; Shopping behavior; Smart product; Task delegation","","","","","","","","Aggarwal P., Mazumdar T., Decision Delegation: A Conceptualization and Empirical Investigation, Psychology & Marketing, 25, 1, pp. 71-93, (2008); Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The Social Influence of Brand Community: Evidence from European Car Clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Allen K.A., Ryan T., Gray D.L.L., McInerney D.M., Waters L., Social Media Use and Social Connectedness in Adolescents: The Positives and the Potential Pitfalls, The Educational and Developmental Psychologist, 31, 1, pp. 18-31, (2014); Andre Q., Carmon Z., Wertenbroch K., Crum A., Frank D., Goldstein W., Huber J., Van Boven L., Weber B., Yang H., Consumer Choice and Autonomy in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, 1-2, pp. 28-37, (2018); Antioco M., Kleijnen M., Consumer Adoption of Technological Innovations: Effects of Psychological and Functional Barriers in a Lack of Content versus a Presence of Content Situation, European Journal of Marketing, 44, 11-12, pp. 1700-1724, (2010); Arts J.W.C., Frambach R.T., Bijmolt T.H.A., Generalizations on Consumer Innovation Adoption: A Meta-Analysis on Drivers of Intention and Behavior, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 28, 2, pp. 134-144, (2011); Atasoy O., Morewedge C.K., Digital Goods are Valued Less Than Physical Goods, Journal of Consumer Research, 44, 6, pp. 1343-1357, (2018); Baird N., Robots, Automation and Retail: Not so Cut and Dried, (2018); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Aaker J.L., Garbinsky E.N., Some Key Differences Between a Happy Life and a Meaningful Life, The Journal of Positive Psychology, 8, 6, pp. 505-516, (2013); Beer J.M., Fisk A.D., Rogers W.A., Toward a Framework for Levels of Robot Autonomy in Human–Robot Interaction, Journal of Human–Robot Interaction, 3, 2, pp. 74-99, (2014); Belk R., Machines and Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Marketing Behavior, 4, 1, pp. 11-30, (2019); Berry L.L., Seiders K., Grewal D., Understanding Service Convenience, Journal of Marketing, 66, 3, pp. 1-17, (2002); Botti S., Iyengar S.S., The Psychological Pleasure and Pain of Choosing: When People Prefer Choosing at the Cost of Subsequent Outcome Satisfaction, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 3, pp. 312-326, (2004); Botti S., Iyengar S.S., The Dark Side of Choice: When Choice Impairs Social Welfare, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 25, 1, pp. 24-38, (2006); Bradlow E.T., Gangwar M., Kopalle P., Voleti S., The Role of Big Data and Predictive Analytics in Retailing, Journal of Retailing, 93, 1, pp. 79-95, (2017); Broniarczyk S.M., Griffin J.G., Decision Difficulty in the Age of Consumer Empowerment, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 608-625, (2014); Castelo N., Lehmann D.R., Be Careful What You Wish For: Unintended Consequences of Increasing Reliance on Technology, Journal of Marketing Behavior, 4, 1, pp. 31-42, (2019); Cefkin M., Human–Machine Interactions and the Coming Age of Autonomy, (2016); Cheng Y., Mukhopadhyay A., Schrift R.Y., Do Costly Options Lead to Better Outcomes?

Especially, when cooperated with image and brand management, it helps destinations to stand out from today's severe crowd of competition. The successful and efficient destination management companies usually play a major role in marketing their destinations, but there exists a conflict in literature on the level of involvement in related marketing activities. Though managing an autonomous organization having its' own budget and freedom in decision making seems to be the best solution to meet the rapidly changing trends and needs of global tourists, it needs to be analyzed within the organizations' managerial level. The aim of this article is to determine the perspectives of DMO managers from the most important two destinations in Turkey, which is a very popular country that is usually in the first 10 in the international tourism market. The destinations chosen are Istanbul and Izmir, which by using destination management within the last 10 years were able to become popular global brands in the world market by increasing their share rapidly. © 2010 Cognizant Comm.

Results of hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that autonomous (i.e., internal) pro-environmental motivation linked to solar adoption regardless of age, income, and education. In contrast, the effects of altruism and controlled (i.e., image and status based) environmental motivation depended on demographic characteristics. That is, altruism was positively associated with adoption for older homeowners, but negatively linked to adoption for younger homeowners. Additionally, controlled motivation predicted solar adoption for both younger and higher income homeowners, but it was not a predictor for older and lower income homeowners. We highlight the importance of assessing interactions between demographics, on one hand, and motives and values, on the other, in order to reveal nuances in the motivations of different types of adopters. These findings underscore the need for more targeted solar policy, marketing, and public messaging. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Demographics; Environmental motivation; Solar panel adoption; Values","","","","","","","","Ivanova D., Barrett J., Wiedenhofer D., Macura B., Callaghan M., Creutzig F., Quantifying the potential for climate change mitigation of consumption options, Environ.

Little attention has been paid to the customers’ and job seekers’ perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers’ attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers’ intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital’s unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies. The topic is worth exploring as key market players (such as Oracle) recognize autonomous technologies as the most ground-breaking innovation that will shape business in the coming years. © 2024, University of Split - Faculty of Economics.

The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information. The resultant data aids in creating autonomous systems that consider the input from customers and prepare restaurant strategies. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Accuracy; Aspect-based; Classification; Document-based; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Uncertain feedback pool","Data mining; Decision making; Information retrieval systems; Lakes; Machine learning; Accuracy; Aspect-based; Decision-making process; Document-based; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Smart classification; Specific tasks; Uncertain feedback pool; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Chen H., Salem A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages, ACM Transact Inf Syst, 26, 3, pp. 1-34, (2008); Boire R., Data Mining Process.

This paper attempts to bring a new perspective to the literature on social media and consumption decisions in the hospitality and tourism sector by focusing on Muslim women as a consumer segment. Based on a survey of 791 Muslim women in the UK, it finds that autonomous self-expression, self-disclosure, and reciprocity to self-disclosure on Facebook were positively related to bonding and bridging social capital, which in turn related positively to their empowerment in hospitality and tourism decision-making. Employment status moderated some of these relations. The paper breaks new ground by bringing together two disparate research strands in the tourism literature: one that focuses on women but ignores religion, and the other that studies Islamic tourism but overlooks the role of women. The findings offer insights into hospitality and tourism marketing strategies aimed at Muslim women. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Empowerment; Facebook; Gender; Islamic tourism; Muslim women; Social media","","","","","","","","Achour M., Nor M., Yusoff M., Work–family demands and subjective well-being among female academicians: the role of Muslim Religiosity, Rev.

Food and grocery is the most promising area for setting up retail business in India. An understanding of shopper retail format choice behaviour will enable retailers to segment their market and target specific consumer groups with strategies premeditated to meet their retail needs. The purpose of this paper is to make a detailed study on the effect of shoppers' demographic, geographic and psychographic dimensions in terms of format choice behaviour in the fast growing Indian food and grocery retailing. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research design is adopted applying mall intercept survey method using structured questionnaire for data collection. Both descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistical tools like χ2, factor analysis and multivariate analysis are used to analyse the data collected from 1,040 food and grocery retail customers from upgraded neighbourhood kirana stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets in conjoint cities of Secunderabad and Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh in India. Findings: The findings suggest that shoppers' age, gender, occupation, education, monthly household income, family size and distance travelled to store have significant association with retail format choice decisions. The choice decisions are also varied among shoppers' demographic attributes. The findings from shoppers' psychographic dimensions like values, lifestyle factors and shopping orientations resulted in segmentation of food and grocery retail consumers into hedonic, utilitarian, autonomous, conventional and socialization type. Practical implications: The study has practical implications for food and grocery retailers for better understanding the shopper behaviour in the context of changing consumer demographic and psychographic characteristics in an emerging Indian retail market. The findings may help the retailers to segment and target the food and grocery retail consumers and, as a consequence, to undertake more effective retail marketing strategies for competitive advantage. Originality/value: Given the absence of published academic literature and empirical findings relating to store format choice behaviour in food and grocery retailing in India, this study may serve as a departure point for future studies in this area of concern. The research is also relevant to retail marketers in terms of format development and reorientation of marketing strategies in the fastest growing Indian retail market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour;

The results of the empirical study are based on a survey carried out to tourists during their visit to the island of Madeira, between March and July 2008. The model confirms that the probability of enhancing Madeira's tourism destination image after the visit is explained by several independent variables, gathered from the literature review. The findings of the study intend to call local authorities's attention to the importance of repeated tourists due to the impact that their enhanced image of Madeira may have on the economic sustainability of the destination and on the potential savings in promotion investment. This happens because the client's loyalty brings a high return of the destination's marketing investment. The conclusions can also help the decision makers of the tourism sector of the island of Madeira to better plan their destination marketing activities.","Destination image; Loyalty; Satisfaction; Service quality;

This is especially relevant in decision-making — the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options —, that is commonly based on personal opinions which may evolve along time. In this work, we present a model of opinion dynamics where opinions are represented using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples, a realistic representation of imprecise information. In our framework, the propagation of opinions in the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes. Additionally, we use a social network to represent agents’ interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). Our opinion dynamics model can be easily integrated into an agent-based system to how opinions spread and evolve. Experimental results show the impact of the communication processes, the social network topology, the awareness deactivation mechanism, and the agents’ influence on the opinion dynamics of others. Furthermore, we present two case studies of our opinion dynamics model applied to marketing and politics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples; Opinion dynamics; Social networks","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Dynamics; Fuzzy logic; Linguistics; Simulation platform; 2-Tuple; 2-tuples; Agent-based model; Deactivation mechanism; Decisions makings; Dynamics models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuple; Fuzzy linguistics; Opinion dynamics; Social network; Computational methods","","","","","AIMAR, (A-TIC-284-UGR18); Andalusian Government, Spain; SIMARK, (P18-TP-4475, RYC-2016-19800); Spanish National Agency of Research; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Universidad de Granada, UGR; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (PGC2018-101216-B-I00); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities , the Andalusian Government, Spain , the University of Granada, Spain , the Spanish National Agency of Research (AEI), and European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) under grants EXASOCO ( PGC2018-101216-B-I00 ), AIMAR ( A-TIC-284-UGR18 ), and SIMARK ( P18-TP-4475 ).

Using multiple agent-based simulation techniques, we investigated the relative importance of three widely adopted seeding strategies (seeding influentials, early adopters, and random targets) in a competitive market in which products are vertically differentiated in terms of quality and brand strength. We found robust evidence that the finding of an optimal seeding strategy depends on consumers' propensity to spread negative WOM. When negative WOM propensity is low, seeding influentials outperform seeding early adopters or random targets. When negative WOM propensity is high, decision-making about an optimal seeding strategy relies on the relative quality and brand strength of the product and the focal firm's objective. In particular, if a product's relative quality is low, seeding early adopters is the optimal seeding strategy in terms of both market share (MS) and net present value (NPV); if the product's relative quality is equal, seeding early adopters is most effective for increasing MS, while seeding influentials is the best for increasing NPV; and if the product's relative quality is high, seeding influentials is the optimal strategy, except that for products with strong brand strength and firm aims at maximizing the MS growth. We conclude the paper by discussing its theoretical contributions and managerial relevance for decision support. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Market competition; New product marketing; Product seeding; Word-of-mouth","Autonomous agents; Commerce; Competition; Computational methods; Decision support systems; Multi agent systems; Agent-based model; Decision supports; Market competition; Market share; New product marketing; Product seeding; Random targets; Relative qualities; Seeding strategies; The net present value (NPV); Decision making","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71901172, 72131005, 72171189); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province, (2022NSFSC0931); Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2023M003, 2023M018)","Funding text 1: This research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72171189, 71901172, 72131005), Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2023M018), and Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province (2022NSFSC0931). ; Funding text 2: This research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72171189, 71901172, 72131005), Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2023M003), and Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province (2022NSFSC0931).","Allard T., Dunn L.H., White K., Negative reviews, positive impact: consumer empathetic responding to unfair word of mouth, J.

Communicating to persuade utilizes marketing techniques to promote behavior change whereas communicating to inform focuses on providing information to facilitate informed decision-making. Communicating to inform is supported by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that autonomy, coupled with competence and relatedness, is a basic psychological need, relevant to making health-decisions and maintaining behavior change. This study aims to assess the above mentioned dynamics of SDT in health messaging through the development of an autonomous scale and assessment criteria. The purpose of the scale is to guide the development of health messaging that aims to communicate to inform (autonomy-enhancing) rather than communicating to persuade or coerce the audience into adopting a specific health behavior (autonomy-diminishing). The results of the study suggest that individual perception of autonomy in health messaging is influenced by a variety of factors.

However, there is still a retail stores chain group that Matahari endures and this is absolutely not autonomous purchasing by the customers. The objective of the study is to identify the qualities of stores and to assess their impacts on the consumer purchasing decision. This is most significant for sellers in today’s unstable market and is worried about sellers’ essential to take into account the effect of selling store image and its relation to purchaser reliability. Methodology: The used method in the research is casual research method. Data is analysing through descriptive analysis method and multiple linear regression. The data is processed through SPSS software. Main Findings: Based on interviews conducted by respondents, one of the store brands in Matahari’s department store is the Executive, which is a store brand that sells clothes, and trousers with expensive price, so if the customer uses the brand product Executive, they will feel proud. Because the customer has a good view of the product of the Executive brand, and the Executive product is sold in Matahari department store, the customer’s assessment of the department store of the Matahari becomes good. Implications/Applications: The results of the research can be used by Matahari department store in developing their marketing strategies in order to promote brand image. © Yudhya.","Consumer purchasing; Indonesia; Market; Matahari; Profitable; Retail; Store attributes; Store image","","","","","","","","Amatyakul S., Polyorat K., The application of brand personality concept to the city context in Thailand, Journal of Administrative and Business Studies, 4, 2, pp. 54-64, (2018); Ayuningrat M.P., Noermijati, Hadiwidjojo D., Green product innovation’s effect on firm performance of managerial environmental concern and green communication, Journal of Administrative and Business Studies, 2, 2, pp. 56-63, (2016); Azeem S., Sharma R.R.K., Elements of the retail marketing mix: A study of different retail formats in India, The Business & Management Review, 5, 4, pp. 51-61, (2015); Doyle P., Fenwick I., How store image affects shopping habits in grocery chains, Journal of Retailing, 50, 4, pp. 39-52, (1974); Engel J.F., Blackwell R.D., Consumer behaviour., (1982); Griffin J., Customer loyalty: Growing and maintaining customer loyalty., (2003); Gundala R.R.R., Retail store image: A study of the Cyprus clothing industry, International Journal of Management and Marketing Research, 3, 3, pp. 67-81, (2010); Hair J.F., Black W.C., Babin B.J., Anderson R.E., Tatham R.L., Multivariate data analysis, 6, (2006); Hasan A., Marketing., (2008); Intan W.S., The analysis factors of experential marketing, product quality, and customer satisfaction of motor bike as a main transportation mode in Bandung-Indonesia, International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, 2, 1, pp. 6-8, (2016); James D.L., Durand R.M., Dreves R.A., Use of a multi-attribute attitude model in a store image study, Journal of Retailing, 52, 2, pp. 23-32, (1976); Khakimyanov M.I., Khusainov F.F., Research energy consumption of well electric submersible pumps for oil production, International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, 2, 1, pp. 1-5, (2016); King J.M., Dubai wins: A content analysis of global media coverage of the 2020 world exposition bidding process using nation branding theory, International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, 2, 6, pp. 201-211, (2016); Kotler P., Keller K., Marketing management., (2009); Kremer F., Viot C., How store brands build retailer brand image, International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management, 40, 7, pp. 528-543, (2012); Krisnawati N., Perangin-Angin L.K., Zainal M., Suardi I., Brand equity analysis and its impact on the loyal customer of local batik to develop its competitiveness (An empirical study of batik Banten in South Tangerang), Journal of Administrative and Business Studies, 2, 4, pp. 189-207, (2016); Newman A.J., Cullen P., Retailing: Environment and operations., (2002); Obaga I.M., Omido K., Garashi H.M., Odera O., Ogutu M., Analysis of retail marketing strategies on Organizational competitiveness, International Journal of Management & Information Technology, 3, 2, pp. 2278-5612, (2013); Oetomo H.W., Budiyanto, Brand image as mediation effect of experiential marketing and differentiation product to the buying decision of Toyota cars, International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, 3, 5, pp. 175-182, (2017); Pranee S., Papapankaid C., Factors affecting purchasing decision of community products in Ranong province, International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, 3, 2, pp. 79-83, (2017); Purba P.R., Sitorus P.M., Influence Analysis of Dissatisfaction, Situational Condition, and Switching Costs on the Switching Behavior of Telkomsel Postpaid Card Customers in Batam City, International Journal of Business and Economic Affairs, 2, 3, pp. 193-205, (2017); Rafiah K.K., Ariyanti M., Role of transactional quality and relational quality to customer e-loyalty in marketplace C2C in Indonesia, International Journal of Business and Economic Affairs, 2, 2, pp. 116-126, (2017); Saputra R., Dewi C.K., The impact of brand trust on brand loyalty mediated by customer satisfaction: Case of Tokobagus.com (now OLX.co.id), Journal of Administrative and Business Studies, 1, 1, pp. 8-13, (2016); Sekaran U., Research methods for business (a skill building approach)., (2009); Srisangkaew K., Advanced destination marketing strategy for Chanthaburi Province, Thailand, International Journal of Business and Economic Affairs, 2, 1, pp. 77-84, (2017); Tunggal A.W., Basic Customer Relationship Management (CRM)., (2008); Wibisono A.B., Yani A.R., Muhlisyah A., Developing the “classic” image branding of Madura Batik center as an effort to face AEC (ASEAN Economic Community) 2016, International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, 2, 6, pp. 173-177, (2016); Wichailert K., Yousapornpaiboon K., Brand equity affects brand loyalty of the bottled mineral drinking water in Thailand, Journal of Administrative and Business Studies, 3, 4, pp. 180-191, (2017)","T.B.

More than a year after the Gambelli and Lindman decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the first report of the European Commission on the application of the electronic commerce Directive, the impact of these recent European (r)evolutions for the gaming industry has not always been very clear. In the Netherlands and Belgium, existing jurisprudence was confirmed in the so-called post-Gambelli decisions. In Germany, where most of the competences to regulate gaming activities have been attributed to the autonomous Länder, some courts have recognized that, in the absence of a consistent gaming policy, the imposed restrictions on the cross-border provision of gaming services could not be justified by the imperative reasons of public order. In Spain, the Loterías y Apuestas del Estado (LAE) is maintaining its position that it has the exclusive right to offer and promote games on the Internet. In Italy, a regional court has had to refer a gaming case to European Court of Justice (ECJ). The conclusion of one year post-Gambelli case-law is that the Gambelli and Lindman requirements are applied in a very diverging manner. In the Dutch Betfair appeal case, it was even insinuated that Gambelli was not relevant! Before commenting on these national decisions, the Gambelli and Lindman decisions will be reviewed again. © 2005 Ewout Keuleers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: The manufacturer purchases optional components of a certain functionality from his alternative suppliers and customizes a set of platform products for retailers in different independent market segments. To tackle the studied problem, a hierarchical analytical target cascading (ATC) model is proposed, Jaya algorithm is applied and supplier selection and product family design are implemented in its encoding procedure. Findings: A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the ATC model in solving the optimization problem and the corresponding algorithm. It has shown that the ATC model can not only obtain close optimization results as a central optimization method but also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. Originality/value: This paper first develops a three-stage cloud-based management system to optimize GHG emission, marketing decisions, supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain. Then, the ATC model is proposed to obtain the close optimization results as central optimization method and also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytical target cascading;

A use cue (2) x social cue (2) x repetition (3) fully within-subjects factorial design experiment with young adults (N = 164) was conducted. Findings demonstrated that participants paid greater attention to the fast food ads which contained multiple people (group cue) eating the advertised food products (use cue) when compared to other types of fast food ads. In addition, participants also self-reported greater social support and purchase intention when seeing use and group cues in ads. Understanding how these cues function in food advertising to encourage unhealthy eating may help health practitioners and individuals create more helpful intervention strategies. Further, applying these marketing tactics to ads for food products that are healthier (i.e., less energy dense and more nutrient dense) may help to maximize healthy food palatability, thereby increasing motivation for viewers to make autonomous decisions about eating healthier. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Advertising; Cues; Emotions; Food; Humans; Intention; Social Support; Television; adult; advertising; article; attention; factorial design; fast food; feeding behavior; female; health practitioner; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; marketing; motivation; nutrient; palatability; social support; young adult; association; behavior; emotion; food; social support; television","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Bailey R.L., Processing food advertisements: Initial biological responses matter, Communication Monographs, 82, pp. 163-178, (2015); Bailey R.L., Modern foraging: Presence of food and energy density influence motivational processing of food advertisements, Appetite, 107, pp. 568-574, (2016); Bailey R.L., Influencing eating choices: Biological food cues in advertising and packaging alter trajectories of decision making and behavior, Health Communication, 32, pp. 1183-1191, (2017); Bailey R.L., Liu J., Wang T., Primary biological motivators in food advertisements: Energy density and sexual appeals compete for appetitive motivational activation.

One of the main goals of this campaign is the implementation of the sustainability principles in the development and deployment cycle of the new generation technologies. This paper focuses on the fast-growing field of autonomous mobile robots and the harsh environment exploration problem. Currently, most state-of-the-art navigation methods are utilising the idea of evaluating candidate observation locations by combining different task-related criteria. However, these map building solutions are often designed for operating in near-perfect environments, neglecting such factors as the danger to the robot. In this paper, a new strategy that aims to address the safety and re-usability of the autonomous mobile agent by implementing the economic sustainability principles is proposed. A novel multi-criteria decision-making method ofWeighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment-Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets, namely WASPAS-SVNS, and the weight selection method of Step-Wise Weights Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) are applied to model a dynamic decision-making system. The experimental evaluation of the proposed strategy shows that increased survivability of the autonomous agent can be observed. Compared to the greedy baseline strategy, the proposed method forms the movement path which orients the autonomous agent away from dangerous obstacles. © 2019 by the authors.","Autonomous robot; Harsh environment; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neutrosophic sets; Sustainability; SWARA; WASPAS-SVNS","decision making; environmental conditions; European Union; experimental study; exploration; implementation process; marketing; multicriteria analysis; robotics; sustainability","","","","","","","Bi Z., Revisiting System Paradigms from the Viewpoint of Manufacturing Sustainability, Sustainability, 3, pp. 1323-1340, (2011); Closing the Loop-An EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy, (2015); Report on Critical Raw Materials and the Circular Economy, (2018); Bugmann G., Siegel M., Burcin R., A role for robotics in sustainable development?, Proceedings of the IEEE Africon'11, Livingstone, Zambia, 13-15 September 2011, pp. 1-4, (2011); World Robotics Report 2016, (2018); Khaleghi A.M., Xu D., Wang Z., Li M., Lobos A., Liu J., Son Y.-J., A DDDAMS-based planning and control framework for surveillance and crowd control via UAVs and UGVs, Expert Syst.

This research seeks to extend this concept by examining a distinct mode of IO cooperation: favor-based cooperation. This concept refers to voluntary exchanges of preferential treatments between boundary personnel across organizations that are perceived as going beyond the requirements of their role relationships. Methodology/Approach: A qualitative case research design is used to build a grounded theoretical framework on favor-based cooperation. The empirical basis of the proposed framework includes around 300 favor incidents gathered through multiple sources to get a broad and balanced view of the phenomenon. Theoretically, the author employs role theory to conceptualize favor-based cooperation as qua persona, extra-role behavior; additionally, he draws on transaction cost economics (TCE) to examine the value of favor-based cooperation as a means of adaptation relative to TCE relational contracting. Findings: As an extra-role behavior, the added value of favor-based cooperation lies in its capability to provide extra flexibility in the system via informal consent to adaptation requests and preferred access to exchange partner’s time availability. But this mode of cooperation involves a high risk of opportunism when a lot is at stake. Thus, favor-based cooperation best suits IO exchanges that require highly frequent but lowly consequential coordinated adaptation and can enhance IO value creation beyond role-based cooperation (relational contracting) in these situations. Since favor-based cooperation involves transgressing the market forces, it ill-suits IO exchanges that require autonomous adaptations. As a qua persona behavior, favor-based cooperation first and foremost serves the interests of the individuals involved. Thus, whereas interorganizational interest alignment provides sufficient incentive for beneficial role-based cooperation to occur, beneficial favor-based cooperation also requires organizational-individual interest alignment. Research Implications: The inclusion of the favor-based cooperation concept in the study of IO cooperation helps address the overlooked individual aspect of IO cooperation. In the role-based approach that is typical in research on IO cooperation, boundary personnel are viewed as organizational agents who act to maximize their respective organizational interests. In viewing IO cooperation as qua persona behavior (as in the case of favor-based cooperation), the current research explicitly accounts for boundary personnel’s individual interests. While individual interests do account for certain harmful behaviors (e.g., buying business or covering poor performance), they also account for beneficial behaviors that have not been adequately accounted for in role-based theories of IO cooperation. For example, it is individual interests (e.g., the desire to help a friend) that motivate some boundary persons to exert extra efforts to accommodate exchange partner’s unplanned requests for adaptation. Accordingly, knowledge of how the individual interests of the decision-makers affect IO cooperative activities and the outcomes of these activities (via, e.g., favor behaviors) can enhance the explanatory power of theories of cooperation. For example, favor-based cooperation is beneficial particularly in certain exchange situations where role-based cooperation (TCE relational contracting) will likely fail, such as exchange situations that require highly frequent (but lowly consequential) coordinated adaptations. Knowledge of how boundary personnel’s individual interests affect IO cooperation and its outcomes via favor behaviors is also relevant for the understanding of the incentive required for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. According to the role-based view, boundary personnel’s personal motivation is irrelevant. Accordingly, IO interest alignment established via, e.g., mutual credible commitment provides sufficient incentive for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. But to the extent that boundary personnel’s individual interests are relevant, IO interest alignment is necessary but insufficient; organizational-individual interest alignment within each participating organization is also needed for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. Practical Implications: Findings have implications for the role of favor-based cooperation in organizations and effective management of this mode of cooperation. While many organizations appear to value favor-based cooperation, its role is not without controversy, as some scholars view it as harmful behavior that should be discouraged. The findings of this research support a balanced view. Favor-based cooperation is an ultra-flexible means of coordinated adaptation that can help organizations respond effectively to accelerating change in their business environment. However, favor-based cooperation may not be the optimal cooperative mechanism when a lot is at stake; thus, in most exchange situations it should play only a supplemental role. Moreover, this mode of cooperation involves a high probability of misuse. Findings yield unobtrusive measures for effective management of favor exchanges. To benefit from these informal and discretionary cooperative activities, organizations need to develop organizational-individual interest alignment by economic and social incentives. They need to provide boundary personnel with decision criteria to help them select and structure beneficial favor exchange opportunities, and sufficient discretion and resources to realize these opportunities. Originality/Value/Contribution: This research extends the role-based IO cooperation concept to include favor-based cooperation–a qua persona and extra-role behavior. To the author’s knowledge, this research is the first in-depth investigation of this mode of IO cooperation. The findings highlight the distinct scope of favor-based cooperation, specify its added value and downsides as a means of adaptation, and explain the incentive required for beneficial favor-based cooperation to occur. Given that TCE currently has a prominent role in the IO marketing literature, by specifying the value of favor-based cooperation relative to TCE modes of cooperation the current research helps position favor-based cooperation within mainstream IO marketing research. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation;

In order to determine if the gender of those in management positions of the advertisers influences the way of managing the new business environment, a descriptive analysis was carried out using the focus group as a research technique. As a study variable, gender was selected, so two different sessions were held, one with men and the other with women, in order to analyze the characteristics of the advertiser vs. agency relationship. The main conclusion we reached in this research is that there is a different interest for men and women in relation to the different parameters of analysis. While men paid more attention to external competitiveness and the need to react quickly and forcefully to changes, women were more concerned about the disappearance of interdepartmental borders and the way marketing decisions are made. © 2018 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada.

Some of these factors relate to the effects of the economic recessions in the early eighties and the early nineties. Other factors are autonomous trends in a number of economic, demographic, and cultural factors. These factors determine a ""macro marketing mix"" for marketing management decisions of companies. In this article, we discuss the changing consumer environment and its impact on production and retailing of consumer goods and services in the Netherlands for the last decade of this century. This information on the Netherlands, as well as on the other nations of the European Community, is relevant for marketers operating in, or considering entering, the Dutch market.
