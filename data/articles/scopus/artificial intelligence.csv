It also examined the role of amateur photography as a moderator in the relationship between VREs, emotions and visit intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were collected through a structured survey questionnaire administered in India, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine relationships among variables. The formal survey was preceded by a pilot study. The partial least squares-SEM product indicator technique was applied to measure the moderation effect of amateur photography. Findings: When people have high levels of positive emotions in the pre-travel stage with VRE participation, their intentions to visit destinations are stronger. Amateur photography moderated the relationships between user interactivity, memorable experiences, mental imagery and visit intentions. No significant moderating effect was found between emotional experiences and visit intentions. Practical implications: The results indicate that creators of virtual reality (VR) communications should concentrate on producing interactive and visually striking VR content, as the research found that VR experiences with tourism-related activities have a significant impact on potential visitor emotions. Therefore, VR producers should incorporate authentic and distinctive elements into contents, giving viewers realistic and trustworthy VR tourism experiences. Destination marketers should evoke emotions in people to increase motivations to visit the VR-presented places. Destination marketers should create VR content with hedonic elements, fostering a connection and desire to visit the destination presented in the VR. For example, destination marketers can enhance the sensory aspects of VR content with audio, video, haptics and artificial intelligence, encouraging people to be emotionally captivated and fully immersed. The findings indicate that amateur photography has a significant moderating effect on prospective tourists’ intentions to visit a place presented in VR. Thus, destination marketers are advised to provide photogenic and relevant content to users. By using amateur photography, destinations can market their attractions to potential visitors in a more interactive and relatable manner. Showcasing images taken by amateur photographers presents a genuine perspective of the offerings, thereby increasing visit intentions among prospective visitors. Additionally, amateur photography helps promote the destination in a positive light, emphasizing the attractions and other offerings, and this encourages potential visitors to consider the destination as a travel option, thereby increasing visit intentions. Encouraging amateur photographers to take and share images also increases their engagement with the destination, creating a sense of community and connection and ultimately driving visit intentions. Destination marketers should embrace VR tourism content as a means of promoting their destinations to potential customers by considering the three crucial elements of memorable experiences, emotional experiences and mental imagery. In essence, destination management organizations and other decision makers should develop complete VR communication plans that incorporate interactive and visually striking activities. This can be done by creating VR experiences for prospective tourists, which will enable them to pick their preferred destinations at the pre-travel stage. Through this approach, an effective destination marketing strategy can be established. Originality/value: This research has value in making several potential contributions to the tourism applications of VR. It is the first study to use and test the S-O-R framework to analyse tourist behaviour from the perspective of emotions generated by VR applications. The analysis focuses on India’s tourism market, which has not been explored much in the context of VR and from the perspective of a developing country. The research emphasizes the use of VR as a tool to understand tourist behaviour rather than just focusing on visit intentions. The findings provide valuable insights into the importance of VR in tourism. The knowledge generated will contribute to the understanding of the impact of VR experiences on emotions and visit intentions and the moderating effect of amateur photography. It has practical implications for destination marketers in developing effective marketing strategies that enhance tourists’ emotions and motivate visit intentions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Amateur photography;

However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021","Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Electric vehicles; Support vector machines; Adoption; Imputation; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Market evolution; Methodological tools; Neural-networks; Strategic decision making; Supervised machine learning; Support vectors machine; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; prediction; statistical data; supervised classification; supervised learning; technology adoption; Forecasting","","","","","","","Bas J., Cirillo C., Cherchi E., A Stated Choice Experiment for consodering Social Conformity in the adoption of Electric Vehicles, ISCTSC 2020 - The 12th International Conference on Transport Survey Methods, (2020); Berkeley N., Bailey D., Jones A., Jarvis D., Assessing the transition towards Battery Electric Vehicles: A Multi-Level Perspective on drivers of, and barriers to, take up, Transportation Research part A: policy and practice, 106, pp. 320-332, (2017); Bezdek J.C., Hathaway R.J., VAT: a tool for visual assessment of (cluster) tendency., Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCC ’02), 3, pp. 2225-2230, (2002); Bolton R.J., Hand D.J., Statistical fraud detection: a review, Stat.

Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model. Finally, a multifaceted analysis suggests that the proposed framework is not only effective as an explainable recommendation model but also provides a powerful tool for planning various marketing strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Model-intrinsic approach","Decision making; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Marketing; Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Knowledge graphs; Model-intrinsic approach; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Chen X., Explainable Recommendation: A Survey and New Perspectives, (2020); Barredo Arrieta A., Diaz-Rodriguez N., Del Ser J., Bennetot A., Tabik S., Barbado A., Garcia S., Gil-Lopez S., Molina D., Benjamins R., Chatila R., Herrera F., Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Inf.

This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial Intelligence; Decision- Making; Delphi Method; Ethics; Machine Learning; Marketing Management","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (2120481); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [ 2120481 ].

It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout. © 2022, The Author(s).","Business intelligence; CCTV visual intelligence; Retail layout; Store layout; Video analytic","Deep learning; Retail stores; Security systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; CCTV visual intelligence; Customer decisions; In-store marketing; Layout designs; Retail layout; Store layout; Sub fields; Video analytics; Visual intelligence; Sales","","","","","Queensland University of Technology, QUT; School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering, Queensland University of Technology; Business School, Queensland University of Technology; Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, IFE; Faculty of Education, Queensland University of Technology; Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology; Centre for Materials Science, Queensland University of Technology","","Ahmed A.H., Kpalma K., Guedi A.O., Human detection using hog-svm, mixture of gaussian and background contours subtraction, 2017 13Th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), pp. 334-338, (2017); Anic I.D., Radas S., Lim L.K., Relative effects of store traffic and customer traffic flow on shopper spending, Int Rev Retail Distrib Consum Res, 20, 2, pp. 237-250, (2010); Artificial Intelligence for Retail in 2020: 12 Real-World Use Cases; Barghash M.A., Al-Qatawneh L., Ramadan S., Dababneh A., Analytical hierarchy process applied to supermarket layout selection, J Appl Res Ind Eng, 4, 4, pp. 215-226, (2017); Bill M., Dale M., Superstore interactivity: a new self-service paradigm of retail service?, Int J Retail Distrib Manag, 29, 8, pp. 379-389, (2001); Bochkovskiy A., Wang C.Y., Liao H.Y.M., Yolov4: Optimal speed and accuracy of object detection, Corr Arxiv: Abs/2004, 10934, 2020, (2020); Caetano C., Sena J., Bremond F., Dos Santos J.A., Schwartz W.R., Skelemotion: A new representation of skeleton joint sequences based on motion information for 3d action recognition, 2019 16Th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), pp. 1-8, (2019); Cai Y., Wen L., Zhang L., Du D., Wang W., Rethinking object detection in retail stores, The 35Th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2021); Cao J., Li Y., Zhang Z., Partially shared multi-task convolutional neural network with local constraint for face attribute learning, 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4290-4299, (2018); Chen Y., Tian Y., He M., Monocular human pose estimation: a survey of deep learning-based methods, Comput Vis Image Underst, 192, (2020); Chu P., Wang J., You Q., Ling H., Liu Z., Transmot: Spatial-temporal graph transformer for multiple object tracking, Corr, (2021); Cil I., Consumption universes based supermarket layout through association rule mining and multidimensional scaling, Expert Syst Appl, 39, 10, pp. 8611-8625, (2012); Cil I., Ay D., Turkan Y.S., Data driven decision support to supermarket layout, Proceedings of the 8Th WSEAS International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering and Data Bases, AIKED’09, pp. 465-470, (2009); Davenport T., Guha A., Grewal D., Bressgott T., How artificial intelligence will change the future of marketing, J Acad Mark Sci, 48, 1, pp. 24-42, (2020); Donovan R.J., Rossiter J.R., Marcoolyn G., Nesdale A., Store atmosphere and purchasing behavior, J Retail, 70, 3, pp. 283-294, (1994); Don’t Look Now: Why You Should Be Worried about Machines Reading Your Emotions, (2020); DrAsze X., Hoch S.J., Purk M.E., Shelf management and space elasticity, J Retail, 70, 4, pp. 301-326, (1994); Fernando T., Denman S., Sridharan S., Fookes C., Tracking by prediction: A deep generative model for mutli-person localisation and tracking, 2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).

One salient instance of such challenges emerges when vulnerable consumers, consumers who temporarily or permanently lack resource access or control, are unknowingly discriminated against, or excluded from the marketplace. By integrating the literature on consumer vulnerability, AI for social good, and the calls for rethinking marketing for a better world, the current work builds a framework on how to leverage AI technologies to detect, better serve, and empower vulnerable consumers. Specifically, our AID framework advocates for designing AI technologies that make services more accessible, optimize customer experiences and journeys interactively, and to dynamically improve consumer decision-making. Adopting a multi-stakeholder perspective, we also discuss the respective implications for researchers, managers, consumers, and public policy makers. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Justice; Service; Vulnerable consumers","","","","","","","","Agbavor F., Liang H., Predicting dementia from spontaneous speech using large language models, PLOS Digit Health, 1, 12, (2022); Anderson L., Ostrom A.L., Corus C., Fisk R.P., Gallan A.S., Giraldo M., Mende M., Mulder M., Rayburn S.W., Rosenbaum M.S., Shirahada K., Williams J.D., Transformative service research: An agenda for the future, Journal of Business Research, 66, 8, pp. 1203-1210, (2013); Andre Q., Carmon Z., Wertenbroch K., Crum A., Frank D., Goldstein W., Huber J., van Boven L., Weber B., Yang H., Consumer choice and autonomy in the age of artificial intelligence and big data, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, 1-2, pp. 28-37, (2018); Andrew J., Baker M., The general data protection regulation in the age of surveillance capitalism, Journal of Business Ethics, 168, 3, pp. 565-578, (2021); Argawal R., Dugas M., Gao G., Kannan P.K., Emerging technologies and analytics for a new era of value-centered marketing in healthcare, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 9-23, (2020); Auh S., Menguc B., Katsikeas C.S., Jung Y.S., When does customer participation matter?

However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques. The main contribution of this research effort is twofold: the definition of a general-purpose BFF/Sentiment Analysis methodology and the development of a prediction model from online UGC based on the Big Five personality traits in the tourism research scenario. © 2022 Ikenga.

Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States","Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation. © 2022,Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

It encompasses brand identity, organisational culture, values, and reputation, and is key in building relationships with stakeholders. An ethical corporate identity, in particular the perception of a company as ethical and socially responsible, positively influences employee behaviour and engagement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised business management and offers innovative solutions to improve decision-making, efficiency, and transparency. Integrating AI into corporate governance can improve risk management, compliance, and accountability. In the digital age, social media are key in building and maintaining the brand voice of businesses. With the advent of AI, new tools such as Chat GPT have emerged to simplify and accelerate content creation, including social media posts. However, achieving satisfactory brand-voice results using AI requires careful analysis and extensive, representative data that travels into the prompter. Although AI-generated content is fast, it should be vetted by experienced experts to ensure it aligns with brand values and brand image. Although Chat GPT promises to generate content and brand-voice, its successful use requires collaboration with experienced experts and thoughtful consideration of its use in building and maintaining an authentic and effective brand-voice. © (2024), (University of SS.

Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service","","","","","","Groningen Digital Business Center","The authors wish to convey their appreciation to the special issue editors Nicolai Fabian, Evert de Haan, and in particular thank Arnd Vomberg as the editor of this paper for his insightful and valuable inputs and constructive feedback during the entire review process.

Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Errors; Fuzzy neural networks; Marketing; Product development; Accurate prediction; Business product development; Business products; Chatbots; Increasing production; Information loss; Marketing information; Neural network model; Performance; Product information; Neural network models","","","","","Guangxi 14th Five-Year Education Science Planning Project, (,2021A033, 2021ZJY1607, 2021ZJY1612, 2022ZJY1699.2022, 2022ZJY354); Guangxi Graduate Education, (JGY2022122); Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China, (21BGL129); Rural Agriculture, Culture and Tourism for Rural Revitalization, (22FGL024); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710038); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, (2020AC19034); Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents","Funding text 1: This work was sponsored by the following funds: ""Research on Multidimensional Identification and Long-term Governance Mechanism of Relative Poverty of Farming Households in Border Areas"" (Grant No. 20BGL247), General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China under the ""Two Mountains"" Theory, General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21BGL129); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation：A study on the mechanism of physician engagement behaviour in online medical communities from the perspective of network effects (No.2022M710038).

For this purpose, baby boomers, Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z tourists are studied and real-time implications are offered. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a descriptive and exploratory design where the conceptual model of social media-based decision-making is developed through a review of the literature. Quantitative analysis is conducted on primary data from 600 Indian tourists. This is done using a self-administered questionnaire adopted from Gulati (2022) after checking its validity and reliability. The statistical analysis for hypothesis testing is done using PLS-SEM path modelling on pooled data. To study the categorical moderating effect of generations, partial least squares multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA) is performed as a paired comparison on every successive generation. Findings: After testing every successive younger generation with an older generation through PLS-MGA, none of the pairs found any significant differences in path coefficients, as the values obtained were 0.05 < p < 0.95 for all five paths (SM → NR, SM → IS, SM → E, SM → P, SM → PPB). This indicates all the generations behave in a similar manner irrespective of them being older or younger, and age does not moderate social media’s impact on decision-making among Indian tourists. Research limitations/implications: The study establishes India as a unique geographical market and suggests tourism marketers to treat all generations at par, irrespective of age, as they behave and interact with social media in a similar manner. But, because this study is restricted to a single geographical location, i.e. India, further regions can be explored for global generalisation. Future research can also explore other demographics for combined, moderated analysis. Findings from the study suggest that marketers should ensure that equal attention is given to all generations as they engage with social media in a similar manner. Targeted marketing using artificial intelligence can help in ensuring custom ads. Personalisation according to generations can also facilitate greater purchases. Originality/value: The study fills a major population and knowledge gap by exploring a topic that has been highly under-researched. Also, the study adopts an inclusive approach by analysing all the generations, both younger and older, to understand the potential effect of age on moderating the impact that social media has on tourist decision-making. Further, real-time suggestions and implications are offered to tourism marketers with special reference to the Indian tourism industry. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Generations; India; Social media; Tourist decision-making; User generated content","","","","","","","","Boomers have big travel plans in 2020, (2020); Ali F., Rasoolimanesh S.M., Sarstedt M., Ringle C.M., Ryu K., An assessment of the use of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in hospitality research, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 1, pp. 514-538, (2018); Amaro S., Duarte P., Henriques C., Travelers’ use of social media: a clustering approach, Annals of Tourism Research, 59, 7, pp. 1-15, (2016); Ana M.I., Istudor L.G., The role of social media and user-generated-content in millennials, Travel Behavior Management Dynamics Knowledge Economy, 1, pp. 87-104, (2019); Bickart B., Schindler R.M., Internet forums as influential sources of consumer information, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 15, 3, pp. 31-40, (2001); Buhalis D., Law R., Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the internet—the state of eTourism research, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 609-623, (2008); Cheah J.H., Thurasamy Memon R., Chuah F., Ting H., Multigroup analysis using SmartPLS: step-by-Step guidelines for business research, Asian Journal of Business Research, 10, 3, pp. 1-16, (2020); Chin W.W., Dibbern J., An introduction to a permutation based procedure for multi-group PLS analysis: results of tests of differences on simulated data and a cross cultural analysis of the sourcing of information system services between Germany and the USA, Handbook of Partial Least Squares, pp. 171-193, (2010); Christou E., Nella A., Web 2.0 and pricing transparency in hotel services, Social Media in Travel, Tourism and Hospitality.

However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs)","","","","","","","","Sofla M.S., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Mirzaee R.F., Towards Effective Offloading Mechanisms in Fog Computing, Multimed.

In recent years, the rapid development and widespread application of AI have had a profound impact on enterprise management. Enterprise management is no longer limited to traditional manual decision-making and processes, but has been endowed with more efficient and intelligent methods through AI technology. The value co creation theory has completely changed the management methods of modern enterprises, transforming them from simple value carriers to active value co creators. In this situation, enterprise value chain management requires strategic enhancement, optimized design, functional management, and reputation management to adapt to these changes. The emergence of artificial intelligence as the core of the new industrial revolution further amplifies the importance of these adaptations. Under the guidance of value co creation theory, this article analyzes and explores the structure, characteristics, and transformation of enterprise value chains. Explored the management strategies of enterprise value chains, with a particular focus on the composition of consumer centered value chains. In addition, it also studied the use of artificial intelligence to deepen the enterprise management value chain, strengthen its architecture through artificial intelligence technology, and design an effective enterprise management system. Considering the changes in the business model of the entire value chain system, the transformation mechanism of artificial intelligence in the enterprise value chain was studied. Integrating neural network algorithms into enterprise management systems can achieve optimization and form a new enterprise management value chain. Empirical experiments and surveys have proven the effectiveness of the new value chain, significantly improving customer satisfaction (11.45%), customer experience satisfaction (13.61%), enterprise marketing satisfaction (11.73%), and enterprise service satisfaction (10.63%). © 2023, Success Culture Press.

Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

Case overview/synopsis: The case study revolves around the entrepreneurial journey of Ajinkya and Satyajit Hange, two brothers who transitioned from successful banking careers to pursue their passion for organic farming. Establishing TBOF in Pune, India, the duo faced challenges in introducing organic produce to a market resistant to change. With a commitment to regenerative agriculture, they implemented innovative farming practices, including desi cow rearing, multicropping and indigenous seeds. The narrative unfolds the brothers’ strategic roles, where Ajinkya manages crop production, and Satyajit focuses on marketing. Emphasizing a trusted brand built on quality, they expanded their product portfolio (Figure 2), reaching 52 countries through direct marketing and word of mouth. As the organic food industry surged postpandemic, TBPF faced challenges in meeting rising demand. The case study discusses the organic farming sector in India, underscoring the brothers’ efforts to combat harmful agro-inputs. The dilemmas lie in navigating the niche organic market, supply–demand imbalances and the need for sustainable business processes. The case study aims to explore the strategic decisions and dilemmas encountered by TBOF, offering insights into the complexities of sustainable entrepreneurship in the Indian organic farming sector.

From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users. Limitations and further research suggest that marketers should investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer’s brand awareness-constructing process. © Cuong Nguyen, Thao Tran, Tien Nguyen, 2024.","brand; e-WOM; entertainment; influencer; interactivity; marketing communications; storytelling; trends","","","","","","","","Aaker D., Aaker on branding: 20 principles that drive success, (2014); Agichtein E., Castillo C., Donato D., Gionis A., Mishne G., Finding high-quality content in social media, Proceedings of the 2008 international conference on web search and data mining, pp. 183-194, (2008); Anderson E.

We analyzed data from 314 mail and in-person interview surveys from farmers in Kentucky, USA. We used a logistic regression model to identify sociodemographic factors influencing the adoption of CBT in farm management, production, and marketing by Kentucky farmers. Results suggest that the higher the farmer's education level, the more likely they will use CBT. Younger farmers are more likely to use CBT than older farmers, and the more acres a farmer owns, the more likely they are to use CBT. The results could help improve education and outreach strategies to reach out to farmers with innovative farm management and marketing strategies. © 2023","Adoption; Computer-based technologies (CBT); Farm management; Logistic regression; Regression; Small farms","Kentucky; United States; Agricultural technology; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Decision support systems; Logistic regression; Marketing; Adoption; Computer based technologies; Computer-based technology; Farm management; Interview survey; Kentucky; Logistic Regression modeling; Logistics regressions; Regression; Small farm; agricultural management; agricultural production; agricultural technology; decision support system; educational attainment; innovation; marketing; regression analysis; sustainability; technology adoption; Farms","","","","","AFRI, (2019-68006-29330); U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA; Economic Research Service, ERS; Kentucky State University, KSU","The findings and conclusions in this paper are those of the authors and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.

In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders’ perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an “intelligent advertising” AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising. Several research questions are offered to guide future research on intelligent advertising to benefit ethical AI decision-making. Finally, several areas that can be widely applied to ethical intelligent advertising are suggested for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).","AI Algorithms; Digital marketing; Ethical considerations","","","","","","","","Abbas A., Zhou Y., Deng S., Zhang P., Text analytics to support sense-making in social media: A language-action perspective, MIS Quarterly., 42, pp. 427-464, (2018); Ajzen I., From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned Behavioral.

However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual influencers are gaining popularity on social media platforms. As a result, companies are compelled to incorporate this emerging trend into their social media campaigns. However, there is limited research available regarding the effectiveness criteria of virtual influencers to guide marketers in their selection decisions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attributes of virtual influencers that impact consumer behavioral intentions, specifically within the fashion domain. Methods:. To measure the antecedents to influencing behavioral intentions, 224 online surveys were distributed to female Instagram users selected through convenience sampling method. The empirical design of the study involoved several Instagram posts created as if by a virtual influencer promoting a fictional fashion brand. These posts measured the constructs related to the research questions, drawing from validated digital human and influencer marketing literature. The collected data was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares method. Results: The study findings revealed that content informativeness, bonding, expertise, human like attributes, and consumer innovativeness all had varying degrees of influence on behavioral intentions, with content informativeness being the most influential factor. Conclusions: The study contributes to the limited literature on virtual influencers and provides novel practical implications to marketers. It also suggests the need for further in-depth studies to identify effective attributes of virtual influencers. © 2023 DSR Publishers/ The University of Jordan.","AI influencer; CGI influencer; computer generated influencer; fashion influencer marketing; Virtual influencer","","","","","","","","Virtual Influencers Are Becoming More Real—Here’s Why Brands Should Be Cautious, (2019); Al-Emadi F.A., Ben Yahia I., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.

With the hype surrounding VIs, more research is required. Thus, this study aims to examine how Gen Z members and millennials react to VIs used for marketing purposes. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows an exploratory approach. The data were collected from 29 participants (14 male and 15 female) through two focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Findings: The authors found that opinions about VIs were mixed, and two main themes emerged from the study: (1) challenges and potential and (2) decision-making and psychological aspects. Originality/value: This study broadens the paradigm for analysing the efficacy of VIs. This emerging topic is of relevance for the marketing sector as well as for transdisciplinary research and practice. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Computer-generated influencer; Exploratory study; Social media; Virtual influencer","","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Kwon S.W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept, The Academy of Management Review, 27, 1, pp. 17-40, (2002); Alboqami H., Trust me, I’m an influencer! – Causal recipes for customer trust in artificial intelligence influencers in the retail industry, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Andersson V., Sobek T., Virtual avatars, virtual influencers and authenticity, (2020); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

Drawing upon anthropomorphism theory and social identity theory, this paper examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in shaping audiences' trust and subsequently pro-environmental behaviors in low- and high-cost contexts. Two online studies employing experimental materials generated by artificial intelligence were conducted. Study 1 revealed that high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) and high racial homophily (local-like virtual influencers) are more effective for eliciting trust in the context of low-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) would further weaken the trust level of a virtual influencer in low anthropomorphism (animate-like virtual influencers). Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in the context of high-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) enhanced the trust in a high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) virtual influencer. The moderated mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. This research advanced our understanding on the moderating role of racial homophily that serves as a cognitive shortcut for low-cost and quick decisions. However, a low racial homophily (foreign-like) virtual influencer would be more effective for high-cost and symbolic pro-environmental behaviors. These insights provide valuable guidance to businesses, marketers, and environmental advocates aiming to leverage virtual influencers for encouraging sustainability practices. © 2024 The Authors.

Sellers and ecommerce firms use social media to increase user engagement, visibility, and sales. Seller ratings are as important as the product ratings on ecommerce platforms to drive buying decisions. Based on sellers’ actions on social media, this study examines seller turnover and disengagement on e-commerce platforms. The study has been supported by the justice theory. Seller reviews and ratings from e-commerce platforms and conversations from social media platforms have been gathered. Using natural language processing, machine learning, partial least squares (PLS) path analysis, and statistical inferences, objectives of the study are met. The study offers recommendations for both practitioners and researchers. The sellers must focus more on interaction and communication than marketing. Through a longitudinal analysis, the study also establishes that ecommerce organizations can use seller social media performance as a predictor of future seller churn and disengagement so they can take the necessary remedial action. © 2023 IGI Global.

By integrating multiple data sources (i.e., practitioner literature, research literature, and expert opinions), we suggest three trends constituting opportunities and challenges (AI applications in different business sectors, primary AI functions, emerging AI topics), three possible themes of change (adoption and acceptance, operations management, AI in marketing), as well as four directions for future research (AI interaction, AI and organizational decision making, organizational implications, and managerial issues). Our findings present a detailed picture of AI development and applications along with predictions regarding its place in the industry. Finally, we outline a research agenda that addresses key issues for stakeholders in hospitality and tourism: individuals, including customers and employees; organizations and businesses; and public policymakers and governments. © The Author(s) 2024.","artificial intelligence;

It highlights the importance of strategically designing image content for business marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study designed a computation extensive research model based upon the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory using 39,139 Facebook posts of 125 organizations selected from Fortune 500 firms. Attributes from images and text were estimated using deep learning models. Subsequently, inferential analysis was established with ordinary least squares regression. Further machine learning algorithms, like support vector regression, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree and random forest, are used to analyze the significance and robustness of the proposed model for predicting engagement metrics. Findings: The results indicate that the social media (SM) image content of B2B firms significantly impacts their social media engagement. The visual and linguistic attributes are extracted from the image using deep learning. The distinctive effect of each feature on social media engagement (SME) is empirically verified in this study. Originality/value: This research presents practical insights formulated by embedding marketing, advertising, image processing and statistical knowledge of SM analytics. The findings of this study provide evidence for the stimulating effect of image content concerning SME. Based on the theoretical implications of this study, marketing and media content practitioners can enhance the efficacy of SM posts in engaging users. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Deep learning; Multimodal analysis; Social media engagement; Stimulus-response model","Commerce; Computation theory; Data Analytics; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Modal analysis; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Big data analytic; Data analytics; Deep learning; Image content; Multimodal analysis; Response model; Social media; Social medium engagement; Stimulus response; Stimulus-response model; Big data","","","","","","","Agostini L., Bigliardi B., Filippelli S., Galati F., Seller reputation, distribution and intention to purchase refurbished products, Journal of Cleaner Production, 316, (2021); Ainin S., Parveen F., Moghavvemi S., Jaafar N.I., Mohd Shuib N.L., Factors influencing the use of social media by SMEs and its performance outcomes, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 115, 3, pp. 570-588, (2015); Bakhshi S., Shamma D.A., Gilbert E., Faces engage us: photos with faces attract more likes and comments on instagram, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 965-974, (2014); Balio S., Casais B., A content marketing framework to analyze customer engagement on social media, Research Anthology on Strategies for Using Social Media as a Service and Tool in Business, pp. 320-336, (2021); Benton L., Five reasons why B2B companies fail at content and social media marketing, B2B News Networks, (2017); Bindemann M., Burton A.M., Hooge I.T.C., Jenkins R., de Haan E.H.F., Faces retain attention, Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 12, 6, pp. 1048-1053, (2005); Bolognesi M., Strik Lievers F., How language and image construct synaesthetic metaphors in print advertising, Visual Communication, 19, 4, pp. 431-457, (2020); Caballero J., Gomez G., Matic S., Sanchez G., Sebastian S., Villacanas A., The rise of GoodFATR: a novel accuracy comparison methodology for indicator extraction tools, Future Generation Computer Systems, 144, pp. 74-89, (2023); De Oliveira Santini F., Ladeira W.J., Pinto D.C., Herter M.M., Sampaio C.H., Babin B.J., Customer engagement in social media: a framework and meta-analysis, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 6, pp. 1211-1228, (2020); De Vries L., Gensler S., Leeflang P.S.H., Popularity of brand posts on brand fan pages: an investigation of the effects of social media marketing, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 83-91, (2012); Deng Q., Wang Y., Rod M., Ji S., Speak to head and heart: the effects of linguistic features on B2B brand engagement on social media, Industrial Marketing Management, 99, pp. 1-15, (2021); Dolan R., Conduit J., Frethey-Bentham C., Fahy J., Goodman S., Social media engagement behavior: a framework for engaging customers through social media content, European Journal of Marketing, 53, 10, pp. 2213-2243, (2019); Gandhi M., Kar A.K., How do Fortune firms build a social presence on social media platforms?

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) – path analysis. Findings: According to the study’s findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: This current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implications: The outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implications: The application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/value: The study’s findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP). In terms of contribution, this study adds to the body of knowledge already available on marketing modification and business performance, particularly in the setting of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Food processing SMEs; Ghana; Marketing modification","","","","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi K., The impact of innovative marketing on the performance of Ghanaian food processing small and medium enterprises (SMEs), (2020); Abueid R., Rehman S.U., Nguyen N.T., The impact of balanced scorecard in estimating the performance of Banks in Palestine, EuroMed Journal of Business, 18, 1, pp. 1450-2194, (2022); Acikdilli G., Mintu-Wimsatt A., Kara A., Spillan J.E., Export market orientation, marketing capabilities and export performance of SMEs in an emerging market: a resource-based approach, Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 30, 4, pp. 526-541, (2022); Adam N.A., Alarifi G., Innovation practices for survival of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the covid-19 times: the role of external support, Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 10, 1, pp. 1-22, (2021); Afriyie S., Du J., Apiah K., The role of marketing capabilities as a resource-based view on organizational performance, American Scientific Research Journal for Engineering, Technology, and Sciences (ASRJETS), 41, 1, pp. 109-123, (2018); Akinseye E.M., Onimole S.O., Ekundayo O.A., Adebusoye A.B., Impact of marketing strategies on organizational growth: a study of selected industries in Lagos state Nigeria, International Journal of Business and Economics Research, 11, 1, pp. 1-7, (2022); Akuffo I.N., Cross-functional teams and innovation performance: the case of multinational enterprises, International Journal of Export Marketing, 3, 3, pp. 204-218, (2020); Alshanty A.M., Emeagwali O.L., Market-sensing capability, knowledge creation and innovation: the moderating role of entrepreneurial-orientation, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 4, 3, pp. 171-178, (2019); Amer F., Hammoud S., Khatatbeh H., Lohner S., Boncz I., Endrei D., The deployment of balanced scorecard in health care organizations: is it beneficial?

These models are numerically solved using a quadratic programming solution approach and implemented in the decision support system (DSS). Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of this paper is to develop the optimisation models for a DSS and evaluate different warranty policies for buyers. Findings: This study has demonstrated the flexibility and usefulness of a model-driven DSS for the quality and warranty management, which is applied to examine and evaluate different configurations (i.e. component reuse, rebuild and recycle) for remanufactured products and propose the selling of extended warranty policies for buyers. Research limitations/implications: The developed model-driven DSS can assist manufacturers to select and increase the number of components, e.g. to be reused, rebuilt, and recycled for producing a remanufactured product and propose suitable warranty policies for buyers. However, this study focusses only on the evaluation of warranty policies for specific remanufactured products in a DSS, i.e. types of air compressors for production operations in manufacturing industry. Originality/value: This study developed optimisation models to be used in a DSS for proposing the selling of extended warranty of a remanufactured product to improve customer satisfaction and maximise the gained profits for manufacturers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision support system;

Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801217, 71872080, 72022007); Tsinghua University, THU, (2019THZWJC12)","The authors appreciate the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments.

Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Online reviews; Review synthesis; Wine reviews","","","","","","2020 Northeast; Machine Learning, and Business Analytics","We thank the Editor, Area Editor, and two anonymous IJRM reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

The study used qualitative analysis and was guided by a knowledge-based theoretical framework. Thematic analysis resulted in the identification of a number of emergent categories. Key findings highlight significant gaps in conventional decision-making systems and demonstrate how big data enhances firms’ strategic and operational decisions as well as facilitates informational access for improved marketing performance. The resulting proposed model can provide managers with a reference point for using big data to line up firms’ activities for more effective marketing efforts and presents a conceptual basis for further empirical studies in this area. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Knowledge-based view; Marketing performance","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Commerce; Data Analytics; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Knowledge based systems; Marketing; Advanced manufacturing; Conceptual model; Data analytics; Decisions makings; Knowledge-based views; Marketing performance; Performance; Qualitative analysis; Real-world implementation; Sustainable industries; artificial intelligence; data management; industrial performance; Internet; knowledge economy; manufacturing; marketing; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Emerald South Asia; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Shivam Gupta (Ph.D.) is an Associate Professor at NEOMA Business School, France with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry.

Big industries started adopting AI for their HR and workforce management (WFM) activities, however, past literature suggests a lack of AI adoption in MSMEs. In the ongoing pandemic, a large number of job loss is reported in the literature. Thus, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent workforce management (WFM) may be critical during or post-pandemic to manage the huge employment in MSMEs. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual framework based on three areas where AI-powered WFM adoption for MSMEs revenue development has been highlighted. These are (a) risk management (workforce), (b) business and marketing, and (c) information exchange. Six hypotheses have been proposed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) with responses from 307 employees. According to the research findings, all of the offered hypotheses are significant. The findings suggest to MSME decision-makers that AI-powered WFM may help revenue growth, workforce risk reduction, intelligent business and marketing, and thoughtful, innovative, and safe information exchange. MSMEs are required to use AI in the information sharing that help in workforce risk management, business and marketing, and intelligent workforce management that scale-up the economic growth. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artificial intelligence;

At the same time, the use of digital marketing as a communication and sales channel has led to the need and use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to correctly manage company information. The understanding of B2B traditional Marketing strategies that use CRMs that work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been studied, however, research focused on the understanding and application of these technologies in B2B digital marketing is scarce. To cover this gap in the literature, this study develops a literature review on the main academic contributions in this area. To visualize the outcomes of the literature review, the results are then analyzed using a statistical approach known as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) under the homogeneity analysis of variance by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) framework programmed in the R language. The research results classify the types of CRMs and their typologies and explore the main techniques and uses of AI-based CRMs in B2B digital marketing. In addition, a discussion, directions and propositions for future research are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence-based CRMs; B2B digital marketing; Multiple correspondence analysis;

New levels of disruption are being introduced using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques of research. In the realm of physical and tangible aspects of service, since this sector have vast amounts of data available application of these techniques are being tested to explore various aspect of the customer experience. Data analysis algorithms like machine learning have been used by firms across the world to analyze these data and understand various facets of customer experience. However, these algorithms suffer from blackbox issues where businesses do not know how the outcome was achieved and if the analysis is biased in some way. In this study, we utilize an explainable machine learning approach on Airbnb data to understand solve two challenges associated with large-scale marketing data. First, we identify and prioritize the customer experience factors like bedrooms, host status, host response rate etc. that have an impact on product pricing. Secondly, we build and test an explainable predictive model on the same. Our research has significant implications for academia and industry in identifying applications of explainable algorithms in decision-making. © 2021 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Customer experience; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Tourism","","","","","","","","Azam N., Yao J., Comparison of term frequency and document frequency based feature selection metrics in text categorization, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 5, pp. 4760-4768, (2012); Babin B.J., Darden W.R., Griffin M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 4, pp. 644-656, (1994); Batista G.E.A.P.A., Monard M.C., An analysis of four missing data treatment methods for supervised learning, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 17, 5-6, pp. 519-533, (2003); Bolton R.N., McColl-Kennedy J.R., Cheung L., Gallan A., Orsingher C., Witell L., Et al., Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, Journal of Service Management, 20, pp. 644-656, (2018); Bose I., Mahapatra R.K., Business data mining—A machine learning perspective, Information & Management, 39, 3, pp. 211-225, (2001); Bueno E.V., Weber T.B.B., Bomfim E.L., Kato H.T., Measuring customer experience in service: A systematic review, The Service Industries Journal, 39, 11-12, pp. 779-798, (2019); Bullock L., (2021); Cambra-Fierro J., Gao L.X., Melero-Polo I., Sese F.J., What drives consumers’ active participation in the online channel?

However, actionable guidelines to promote a holistic adaptation and the effective functioning of destination marketing/management organizations (DMOs) in the increasingly data-infused world are still needed. This perspective paper posits a research-based framework that DMOs can use to become more responsive and efficient in their marketing and planning efforts in the current AI-infused world. Four propositions are presented to support DMOs’ transition to the insight-era: (a) DMOs’ organizational adaptations and workforce development and training, (b) active engagement with destinations’ stakeholders and data sharing, (c) leverage user-generated data and emergent technologies for destination marketing, and (d) DMOs’ data-driven decision making. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data; data-driven decision-making; data-driven eco-systems; destination marketing organizations; insight Era; the Internet of Things","","","","","","Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, TIP, (1937833)","","Castells M., The Information Age, Media Stud.

Such automated decision-making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision-making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long-term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference-in-differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self-regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision-making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps. © 2023 The Authors.

The information is used to create the model and improve the quality of products and services to satisfy customers. There are two major parts to a sale's planning: containing sales tactics and sales strategy. To aid in business decision-making, a data warehouse (DW) for sales collects and organizes relevant and historical data. DW is also a method for combining data from various heterogeneous databases (DB) and other sources of information for analysis. In this paper, Information analysis for dynamic Sale planning by AI Decision support process was done. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithms have been used to find optimal MVs for sale planning since several authors prove that these algorithms are better than other existing algorithms. MVs selection is based on three factors: time running of MVs, area of MVs, and access frequency of MVs by manipulating the selection result using a weighted combination of each factor as needed by the designer. For PSO, the most cost of frequency was 1.924 for View (V) 11, while for QPSO, it was 1.722 for V11. For PSO, the most cost of time was 1.931 for V2, while for QPSO, it was 1.221 for V22. For PSO, the most cost of the area was 1.800 for V17, while for QPSO, it was 1.071 for V17. The results revealed that Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization is much more accurate than Particle Swarm Optimization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence AI; Database management system; Decision support process;

However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency. © 2024 The Authors","Aeronautics; Artificial Intelligence; Benefits; Performance; Use cases","Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Predictive analytics; Air France; Artificial intelligence technologies; Benefit; Conceptual maps; Dassault Aviation; Easyjet; Performance; Scientific literature; Sequential approach; Use case; Efficiency","","","","","","","Ahmed R., Shaheen S., Philbin S.P., The role of big data analytics and decision-making in achieving project success, J.

Despite its widespread acceptance, among patients and practitioners, there are concerns that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence may threaten elements of patient-centered care, such as personal relationships with care providers and patient-driven choices. This study explores the extent to which patients are confident in and comfortable with the use of these technologies when it comes to their own individual care and identifies areas that may align with or threaten elements of patient-centered care. Methods: An exploratory, mixed-method approach was used to analyze survey data from 600 US-based adults in the State of Florida. The survey was administered through a leading market research provider (August 10–21, 2023), and responses were collected to be representative of the state’s population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Results: Respondents were more comfortable with the use of AI in health-related tasks that were not associated with doctor-patient relationships, such as scheduling patient appointments or follow-ups (84.2%). Fear of losing the ‘human touch’ associated with doctors was a common theme within qualitative coding, suggesting a potential conflict between the implementation of AI and patient-centered care. In addition, decision self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of comfort with AI, but there were also concerns about losing decision-making control, workforce changes, and cost concerns. A small majority of participants mentioned that AI could be useful for doctors and lead to more equitable care but only when used within limits. Conclusion: The application of AI in medical care is rapidly advancing, but oversight, regulation, and guidance addressing critical aspects of patient-centered care are lacking. While there is no evidence that AI will undermine patient-physician relationships at this time, there is concern on the part of patients regarding the application of AI within medical care and specifically as it relates to their interaction with physicians. Medical guidance on incorporating AI while adhering to the principles of patient-centered care is needed to clarify how AI will augment medical care. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Patient-centered care; Patient-physician relationship; Public perception","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Florida; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient-Centered Care; Physician-Patient Relations; Public Opinion; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; article; artificial intelligence; doctor patient relationship; ethnicity; fear; follow up; human; marketing; medical care; perception; person centered care; physician; self concept; United States; adolescent; aged; ethics; female; Florida; health care delivery; male; middle aged; public opinion; questionnaire; young adult","","","","","Florida Center for Cybersecurity","The survey was funded by the Florida Center for Cybersecurity.

The constant access to volume, variety, and veracity of data has made big data an integral part of management studies. New sub-management areas are emerging day by day with the support of big data to drive businesses. This study takes a systematic literature review approach to uncover the emerging management areas supported by big data in contemporary times. For this, we have analyzed the research papers published in the reputed management journals in the last ten years, fir using network analysis followed by natural language processing summarization techniques to find the emerging new management areas which are yet to get much attention. Furthermore, we ran the same exercise in each of these management areas to uncover these areas better. This research will act as a reference for future information systems (IS) scholars who want to perform analysis that is deep-dive in nature on each of these management areas, which in the coming times will get all the due attention to become dedicated research domains in the management area. We finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of future research in each of these management areas, which will be a true value addition for IS researchers. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data;

Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding its application in various business disciplines and is expected to be one of the most important technological tools used in marketing in the years to come. The paper addresses the expected role of artificial intelligence solutions in marketing decision-making throughout the five steps of the marketing process. The study provides a systematic review of the research articles addressing the application of AI for marketing decision-making published in the period from 2020 to 2022. Identified applications are then mapped to five steps of the marketing process: analysis, strategy, tactics, customer relations, and value proposition creation. The findings indicate that most of the current AI applications are utilized in the first stage of the marketing process related to understanding and predicting customer behaviour and in the tactical stage of creating a marketing mix. The paper concludes with recommendations for marketing practitioners and recommendations for further research. © 2022 Nikolina Ljepava; published by UIKTEN.","Ai marketing; Decision-making; Machine learning; Marketing process","","","","","","","","Al-Ghamdi L.

Channel splits have changed and online conversations have exploded. Marketing budgets have decreased as a percentage of revenue, meaning marketing funds must be used more effectively and efficiently than ever. Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers. This paper shows that with the right ‘business translator’ — that is, a person or team operating as the ‘glue’ between data science and business performance — sophisticated data science becomes accessible to commercial teams looking to drive performance improvements. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Galaz V., Centeno M.

AI autonomy, however, sparks skepticism among consumers leading to a decrease in their willingness to adopt AI services. This raises the question as to whether consumer trust in companies can overcome consumer reluctance in their decisions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services. Design/methodology/approach: Using a representative survey (N = 503 consumers corresponding to N = 3,690 observations), this article investigated the link between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services from the company across 23 consumer service companies accounting for six distinct service industries. Findings: The results confirm a significant and positive relationship between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt AI services from the same company. AI autonomy, however, moderates this relationship, such that high (vs low) AI autonomy weakens the positive link between trust in a company and AI service adoption. This finding replicates across all 23 companies and the associated six industries and is robust to the inclusion of several theoretically important control variables. Originality/value: The current research contributes to the recent stream of AI research by drawing attention to the interplay between trust in companies and adoption of high autonomy AI services, with implications for the successful deployment and marketing of AI services. © 2023, Darius-Aurel Frank, Lina Fogt Jacobsen, Helle Alsted Søndergaard and Tobias Otterbring.","Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Innovation adoption; Trust in the company","","","","","","Carlsbergfondet, (CF21_0225)","This research received support from the Carlsberg Foundation through a research infrastructure grant (No. CF21_0225).","Aaker D.A., Keller K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 27-41, (1990); Andre Q., Carmon Z., Wertenbroch K., Crum A., Frank D., Goldstein W., Huber J., Van Boven L., Weber B., Yang H., Consumer choice and autonomy in the age of artificial intelligence and big data, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, pp. 28-37, (2018); Aurier P., N'Goala G., The differing and mediating roles of trust and relationship commitment in service relationship maintenance and development, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 3, pp. 303-325, (2010); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Funder D.C., Psychology as the science of self-reports and finger movements: whatever happened to actual behavior?, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2, 4, pp. 396-403, (2007); Becerra E.P., Korgaonkar P.K., Effects of trust beliefs on consumers' online intentions, European Journal of Marketing, 45, 6, pp. 936-962, (2011); Beer J.M., Fisk A.D., Rogers W.A., Toward a framework for levels of robot autonomy in human-robot interaction, Journal of Human-Robot Interaction, 3, 2, (2014); Bergkvist L., Rossiter J.R., The predictive validity of multiple-item versus single-item measures of the same constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 2, pp. 175-184, (2007); Bilgihan A., Gen Y customer loyalty in online shopping: an integrated model of trust, user experience and branding, Computers in Human Behavior, 61, pp. 103-113, (2016); Bottomley P.A., Holden S.J.S., Do we really know how consumers evaluate brand extensions?

Little attention has been paid to the customers’ and job seekers’ perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers’ attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers’ intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital’s unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies. The topic is worth exploring as key market players (such as Oracle) recognize autonomous technologies as the most ground-breaking innovation that will shape business in the coming years. © 2024, University of Split - Faculty of Economics.

CMU School of Computer Science also initiated a new undergraduate degree in AI in 2018. City University of Hong Kong (CityU) has also developed different programs on AI, such as Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence or Logistics and Artificial Intelligence. Universities with a higher number of patents have programs that relate scientific and academic research with its practical application in the field of business management in many different sectors, many of them promoted jointly with companies and some other institutions.; Funding text 2: There are also several funding agencies sponsoring research on AI in Business and Economics. The top ten is led in number by European entities: the European Commission (EC), the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) from the UK, and the Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras (FEDER) from Spain. Nevertheless, China is the most prolific country in terms of volume of articles sponsored. Specifically, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) has supported the publication of 144 articles to date, far exceeding the number of articles published by the other entities. Other Asian organisations such as Hong Kong Polytechnic; Funding text 3: University (PolyU) and National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC) are also relevant in this area. The National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S., the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Australian Research Council (ARC) complete the top ten of this ranking.","Altman E.

AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions. Our work contributes to theory and practice with a set of actionable design principles to guide AIADM system design and deployment. © 2024 The Author(s).

The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, is challenging interaction between humans and machines changing the service systems’ value co-creation configurations and logic. To envision possible future scenarios, this paper aims to reflect upon how the humans’ use of AI technology can impact value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is developed, at a conceptual level, using selected elements from managerial and marketing theoretical frameworks interested in value co-creation – Service-Dominant Logic, Service Science and Viable Systems Approach (VSA) – used as interpretative tools to reframe value co-creation in the digital age. Findings: The interpretative approach adopted and, in particular, the new VSA notion of Intelligence Augmentation (IA), in the perspective of the information variety model, shed new light on value co-creation in the digital age framing a possible “IA effect” that can empower value co-creation in complex decision-making contexts. Practical implications: The study provides insights useful in the design and management of service systems suggesting a rethinking of the view of AI as a means for mainly increasing the smartness of service systems and a new focus on the enhancement of the human resources contribution to make the service systems wiser. Originality/value: The paper provides a refocused interpretative view of the interaction between humans and AI that looks at a possible positive impact of the use of AI on humans in terms of augmented decision-making capabilities in conditions of complexity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Intelligence augmentation; Smart service systems; Value co-creation; Wise service systems","","","","","","","","Ackoff R., From data to wisdom, Journal of Applied Systems Analysis, 16, pp. 3-9, (1989); Akaka M.A., Chandler J.D., Roles as rosources: a social roles perspective of change in value networks, Marketing Theory, 11, 3, pp. 243-260, (2010); Akaka M.A., Vargo S.L., Technology as an operant resource in service (eco) systems, Information Systems and e-Business Management, 12, 3, pp. 367-384, (2014); Arthur W.B., The Nature of Technology: What It is and How It Evolves, (2009); Arthur W.B., Where is technology taking the economy?, (2017); Barile S., Management Sistemico Vitale, (2009); Barile S., Polese F., Smart service systems and viable service systems: applying systems theory to service science, Service Science, 2, 1-2, pp. 21-40, (2010); Barile S., Saviano M., An introduction to a value co-creation model, viability, syntropy and resonance in dyadic interaction, Syntropy, 2, 2, pp. 69-89, (2013); Barile S., Saviano M., Complexity and sustainability in management: insights from a systems perspective, Social Dynamics in a Systems Perspective, pp. 39-63, (2018); Barile S., Di Nauta P., Iandolo F., La Decostruzione Della Complessità, Studi MOA, Collana Studi di Management e Organizzazione Aziendale, (2016); Barile S., Saviano M., Polese F., Information asymmetry and co-creation in health care services, Australasian Marketing Journal (Journal), 22, 3, pp. 205-217, (2014); Barile S., Espejo R., Perko I., Saviano M., Cybernetics and Systems: Social and Business Decisions, (2018); Barile S., Orecchini F., Saviano M., Farioli F., People, technology, and governance for sustainability: the contribution of systems and cyber-systemic thinking, Sustainability Science, 13, 5, pp. 1197-1208, (2018); Barile S., Pels J., Polese F., Saviano M., An introduction to the viable systems approach and its contribution to marketing, Journal of Business Market Management, 5, 2, pp. 54-78, (2012); Barile S., Bassano C., Lettieri M., Piciocchi P., Saviano M., Intelligence augmentation (IA) in complex decision making: a new view of the VSA concept of relevance, AHFE 2020, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC), 1208, pp. 1-8, (2020); Barile S., Lusch R., Reynoso J., Saviano M., Spohrer J., Systems, networks, and ecosystems in service research, Journal of Service Management, (2016); Barile S., Piciocchi P., Bassano C., Spohrer J.C., Pietronudo M.C., Re-defining the role of artificial intelligence in wiser service systems, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC), 787, pp. 159-170, (2019); Barile S., Polese F., Saviano M., Carrubbo L., Clarizia F., Service research contribution to healthcare networks’ understanding, Innovative Service Perspectives, 1, (2012); Barile S., Bassano C., Spohrer J.C., Piciocchi P., Pietronudo M.C., Saviano M., AI & value co-creation: an integrated VSA and SS perspective, paper presented at the AIRSI 2019 Conference, (2019); Barile S., Ferretti M., Bassano C., Piciocchi P., Spohrer J., Pietronudo M.C., From smart to wise systems: shifting from artificial intelligence (AI) to intelligence augmentation (IA), poster presented at the First in International Workshop on Opentech AI in Helsinki, (2018); Bassano C., Piciocchi P., Spohrer J.C., Pietronudo M.C., Managing value co-creation in consumer service systems within smart retail settings, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 45, pp. 190-197, (2018); Bassano C., Barile S., Saviano M., Cosimato S., Pietronudo M.C., AI technologies & value co-creation in a luxury context, Paper presented at the 53th HI International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS), (2020); Beer S., Brain of the Firm: The Managerial Cybernetics of Organization, (1972); Breidbach C., Maglio P., Technology-enabled value co-creation: an empirical analysis of actors, resources, and practices, Industrial Marketing Management, 56, (2016); Brynjolfsson E., Mcafee A., The business of artificial intelligence, Harvard Business Review, 1, (2017); Campbell M., Hoane A.J., Hsu F.H., Deep blue, Artificial Intelligence, 134, 1-2, pp. 57-83, (2002); Carayannis E.G., Del Giudice M., Saviano M., Caputo F., Beyond big data.

Although these theories differ on a variety of dimensions, including domains of application and specific definitions, they all share the basic assumption that two different modes of information processing operate in making judgments, decisions as well as in solving problems. In essence, the common distinction in dual process modes is between a fast, associative information process mode with low effort heuristics, and a slow, rule-based mode with high effort systematic process. On the basis of a brief theoretical development introduction, we illustrate how the dual process theory is manifested in various disciplines. Table 1 summarizes the different representations of dual process, including heuristic vs. systematic; peripheral route vs. central route; associative access vs. attitude construct; categorization vs. individuation; automatic contextual influences vs. correction; experiential vs. rational; impulsive vs. reflective; implicit vs. explicit. Later on, we discuss how different types of information processing modes are determined and what the main factors that may significantly influence information processing adoption. Several determinants are identified froma review of the extant literature; for instance, the involvement would be an influential factor that affects what type of information processing mode adopted. Specifically, if an information processor does not have a high level of involvement, it would be more likely of him / her to adopt a heuristic mode comparing with a systematic mode. Similarly, if a consumer does not in a focal status of high motivation, comparing with the one with a high level of motivation, he/ she would be more likely to adopt a heuristic mode. The related factors that are generally discussed in previous studied are shown in Table 2. Although we may learn that these factors as listed are playing significant roles in influencing what type of information processing mode adopted, little has been discussed in prior research in relation to the possible interaction effects that would play a role. In particular, we could conjecture that a higher level of motivation of information processor would be more likely to adopt systematic information processing mode, but what would be happen if the information processor does not have a higher level of ability to process the information in order to make a judgment or decision? Will the information processor adopt systematic mode or heuristic mode? Moreover, when we try to take the risk as an important factor into consideration, if the decision context is with a high risk, will the information processor adopt systematic processing mode even if he/ she does not have the ability to process related information? Whether the processor would adopt heuristic processing mode when he / she does not have the ability to process? This calls for future research to further explore more rich findings and interesting underlying mechanisms. The exploration of the impacts aroused by various influential factors would be a bright future. Future research could be extended on the basis of the current theory at least from the following three facets. First, the exploration of the theory application. As we discussed above, most of previous studies emphasize on investigating the independent effect of individual factor on information processing mode adoption, while little has been discussed on the underlying effects aroused by interactive factors in various contexts. Take the online product review context-a hot topic studied in information systems, marketing, as well as electronic commerce disciplines-as an example, our review of recent studies shows that although the dual process theories have been widely applied to examine the effects of online product reviews, or the review helpfulness itself, there is scant research regarding what factors that really determine which type of information processing mode used, and whether the information processing mode would be dynamically caused by various interactive factors. On the basis of the analysis of our paper which argues that the determinant factors that would be interactive in affecting the information processing mode, related future research with respect to this area could be widely extended. As regard to the research methodology in examining the focal theory, secondly, we call for more advanced method which could be used in future research in order to explore more interesting findings. Particularly, the current studies in relation to the dual process theories largely focus on experimental method or survey, while few attentions have been paid by using behavioral data to deduce what type of information processing mode being used. Based on the research logic presented by recent seminal papers such as Gladstone et al., Stachl et al. and Wu et al., we think it is feasible to extend the method scope to examine this theory. In addition, third, with respect to the extension of the theory itself, in line the recent arguments of seminal papers published on Nature (Rahwan et al.) and California Management Review (Huang et al., we may conjecture that the dual process theory could be extended in the new artificial intelligence era. In particular, during the interaction between human and robot (artificial intelligence), it is imperative to understand whether the robot, cognitively, will use these two different types of processing modes in their information processing like human? How would the robot be in the eye of human when the brain becomes to integrate with robot? Will the robot be the third processing mode complementing with the original two processing mode? Or will the robot interrupt the original two processing modes? Or will the robot replace the one type of either processing mode? We call for future research to further explore the bright and interesting area to explore the effects of interaction between human and robot. © 2021.

However, when machine learning is used for decision-making, bias rooted in unrepresentative datasets, inadequate models, weak algorithm designs, or human stereotypes can lead to low performance and unfair decisions, resulting in financial, social, and reputational losses. This paper offers a systematic, interdisciplinary literature review of machine learning biases as well as methods to avoid and mitigate these biases. We identified eight distinct machine learning biases, summarized these biases in the cross-industry standard process for data mining to account for all phases of machine learning projects, and outline twenty-four mitigation methods. We further contextualize these biases in a real-world case study and illustrate adequate mitigation strategies. These insights synthesize the literature on machine learning biases in a concise manner and point to the importance of human judgment for machine learning algorithms. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Case study; Machine learning; Mitigation methods","","","","","","Academy of Marketing Science","Dennis Herhausen (Ph.D., University of St.Gallen) is Associate Professor of Marketing at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance. In addition, HMDM and AAI are also proposed for firms to optimise FCMP. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Competitive marketing performance; Holistic marketing decision; Marketing analytics capability","","","","","","North South University","The authors acknowledge North South University (NSU) for awarding research grant to conduct this research.","Aderemi H.O., Oyebisi T.O., Management and evaluation of technological capability in ICT firms: an information system approach, International Journal of Business Information Systems, 11, 2, pp. 127-147, (2012);

While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","artificial intelligence; autonomous vehicles; brand concept; innovation; self-brand connection","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Keller K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 27-41, (1990); Aboulnasr K., Tran G.A., Is love really blind?

Design/methodology/approach: A survey strategy was used in this study to collect data from 225 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) respondents who were on the registered list of the Ghana Enterprise Agency in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Structural equation modeling – path analysis was used to estimate the impact of AIM on the performance of SMEs. Findings: The analyzed data shows that AIM has significant impact on the financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance in the case of SMEs in Ghana. This study establishes the significance of AIM approach in achieving financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance through the application of AIM determinants including, Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative decision-making systems (CDMS), virtual and augmented reality (VAR) and personalization. Research limitations/implications: Aside the aforementioned significance of this research study, this study has limitations. The sample size of this research study can be expanded to include SME respondents in other geographical areas that were not considered in this study. Future research studies should concentrate on how AIM can analyze customer communications and information such as posts on social media to develop future communications that may enhance customer engagement. Practical implications: The practical implications comprise of two key items. First, this research study encourages SME owners and managers to develop an AIM method as a fundamental strategic goal in their pursuit to improve SME performance. Second, SME owners and managers should increasingly implement the four determinants of AIM indicated in this research study (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) to develop essential resources for effective application of AIM to improve their performance. Originality/value: The results of this study provide a strong support to RBV theory and the proposition that AIM and its determinants (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) should be recognized as an essential strategic resource for improving the performance (i.e., financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance) of SMEs. This study also contributes to the current body of knowledge on AIM and management, particularly in the context of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence in marketing (AIM); Business organization performance; Emerging economy; SMEs","","","","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi K., The impact of innovative marketing on the performance of Ghanaian food processing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), (2020); Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Amer F., Hammoud S., Khatatbeh H., Lohner S., Boncz I., Endrei D., The deployment of balanced scorecard in health care organizations: is it beneficial?

Accordingly, this study investigates the approaches that AI can be used for enabling B2B marketing innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Applying a bibliometric research method, this study systematically investigates the literature regarding AI-enabled B2B marketing. It synthesises state-of-the-art knowledge from 221 journal articles published between 1990 and 2021. Findings: Apart from offering specific information regarding the most influential authors and most frequently cited articles, the study further categorises the use of AI for innovation in B2B marketing into five domains, identifying the main trends in the literature and suggesting directions for future research. Practical implications: Through the five identified domains, practitioners can assess their current use of AI and identify their future needs in the relevant domains in order to make appropriate decisions on how to invest in AI. Thus, the research enables companies to realise their digital marketing innovation strategies through AI. Originality/value: The research represents one of the first large-scale reviews of relevant literature on AI in B2B marketing by (1) obtaining and comparing the most influential works based on a series of analyses; (2) identifying five domains of research into how AI can be used for facilitating B2B marketing innovation and (3) classifying relevant articles into five different time periods in order to identify both past trends and future directions in this specific field. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

This topic has long gone beyond the information sphere, as it now applies to almost every sphere of life: economic, telecommunications, education, medicine, administration, and especially defense. Predicting customer behavior based on scoring models is in its infancy in Ukrainian companies, the main ones being the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning, which will be the leading catalyst that will facilitate decision-making in business in the nearest future. The aim of the study is to develop a scoring model that predicts the behavior of target segments, namely, updating their activity to activate advertising tools. To achieve the goal of the work a set of research methods was used: dialectical-to reveal the theoretical foundations of models and types of forecasting models; analytical-in the study of the functioning of the environment SAS, Anaconda; optimization methods-to choose the best model and generate features. Scientific novelty and theoretical significance lie in the development of a scoring model for predicting the activity of subscribers of the telecommunications company ""VF Ukraine"", on the basis of which marketing campaigns are conducted. With the help of the built-in scoring model, the company ""VF Ukraine""can target its campaigns to retain subscribers. The marketing directorate of the enterprise can choose the TOP-20 or TOP-30 of the most prone subscribers to non-resumption of activity, i.e., tend to switch to other mobile operators, and hold promotions for them-providing additional gifts and bonuses, money to mobile account.  © 2022 Tetiana Zatonatska et al., published by Sciendo.","advertising; big data; market segment; scoring models; target; telecommunication sector","","","","","","","","Airola A., Pahikkala T., Waegeman W., De Baets B., Salakoski T., An experimental comparison of cross-validation techniques for estimating the area under the ROC-curve, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 55, 4, pp. 1828-1844, (2011); Celisse A., Optimal cross-validation in density estimation with the L<sup>2</sup>-loss, The Annals of Statistics, 42, 5, pp. 1879-1910, (2014); Dai D., Identifying dissatisfied 4G customers from network indicators: A comparison between complaint and survey data, Big Data Applications in the Telecommunications Industry, pp. 41-53, (2017); Dang Ch, Network-based targeting: Big Data application in mobile industry, Big Data Applications in the Telecommunications Industry, pp. 78-107, (2017); Deroos D., Zikopoulos P.C., Melnyk R.B., Brown B., Coss R., Hadoop for dummies, (2014); Dluhopolskyi O., Simakhova A., Zatonatska T., Oleksiv I., Kozlovskyi S., Potential of virtual reality in the current digital society: economic perspectives, 11th International Conference on Advanced Computer Information Technologies, (2021); pp. 360-363; Fawcett T., An introduction to ROC analysis, Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 8, pp. 861-874, (2006); Goworek D., The big impact of Big Data on the telecom industry, (2021); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., Elements of Statistical Learning: data mining, inference, and prediction, (2017); Hssina B., Merbouha A., Ezzikouri H., Erritali M., A comparative study of decision tree ID3 and C4.5, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), Special Issue on Advances in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networking and Applications, pp. 13-19, (2014); Kuhn M., Johnson K., Applied Predictive Modeling, (2013); Lurie A., 39 Data Visualization Tools for Big Data, (2014); Discover Feature Engineering, How to Engineer Features and How to Get Good at It, (2015); McLachlan G.J., Do K.-A., Ambroise C., Analyzing microarray gene expression data, (2004); Molinaro A.M., Simon R., Pfeiffer R.M., Prediction error estimation: A comparison of resampling methods, Bioinformatics, 21, 15, pp. 3301-3307, (2005); Mykhalchuk T., Zatonatska T., Dluhopolskyi O., Zhukovska A., Dluhopolska T., Liakhovych L., Development of recommendation system in e-commerce using emotional analysis and machine learning methods, The 11th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications (IDAACS), 1, pp. 527-535, (2021); Perkhofer L., Walchshofer C., Hofer P., Does design matter when visualizing Big Data?

A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

While acknowledging the capabilities of AI chatbots to handle customer interactions and improve response times, we critically examine several challenges they present, including interoperability challenges, data protection concerns, and biased output. This research presents a novel framework for managers to assess a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM), which has been adapted to account for the critical challenges associated with the emerging technology. Incorporating four factors—subjective norms, compatibility, facilitating conditions, and trust—allows for a more holistic assessment of a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology. The framework, together with a readiness assessment tool, provides a comprehensive mechanism for managerial decision-making, focusing on the adoption of AI chatbots in customer service, sales, and marketing business functions. In exploring these factors, our article explores the managerial implications of integrating AI chatbots into business processes, ensuring an informed and holistic approach to technology adoption. © 2024 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Artificial intelligence;

Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R&D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company’s management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company’s growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm’s commercialization strategy. For the last years, the KIBO Patent Appraisal System (KPAS-II) herein proposed has been advanced by KIBO as a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI) and evaluation data applications valuation system that automatically calculates and estimates a technology’s feasible economic value by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic index information of a patent and the commercialization entity’s business ca-pabilities, and by applying to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method in valuation theory, and finally integrating with deep learning results based on the in-advance previously established patent DB and the financial DB. The KPAS-II proposed in this study can be said to have dramatically overcome the long-term preparation period and high levels of R&D and commercialization costs in terms of the limitations that the existing technology valuation method possesses by enhancing the reliability of approximate economic values from the deep learning results based on financial data and completed valuation data. In addition, it is expected that technology marketing coordinators, researchers, and non-specialty business agents, not limited to valuation experts, can easily estimate the economic values of their patents or technologies, and they can be actively utilized in a technology-based company’s decision-making and technologically dependent financial activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics","Artificial intelligence; Environmental management; Location; Product design; Purchasing; Sales; Autonomous learning; Consumer evaluation; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Environmental problems; Environmental sustainability; Hierarchical linear modeling; Need for cognitions; Sustainable development","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16K13396, 19K21707, 20H01554); Waseda University, (2019C-152)","The author is grateful to all survey respondents and to Yang Yang and Shan Zheng for their contributions to the data collection.

However, this exhilaration is being tempered by growing concerns about the moral and legal implications of using AI in marketing. Although previous research has revealed various ethical and legal issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and data privacy, there are no definitive answers. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating AI’s ethical and legal concerns in marketing and suggesting feasible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper synthesises information from academic articles, industry reports, case studies and legal documents through a thematic literature review. A qualitative analysis approach categorises and interprets ethical and legal challenges and proposes potential solutions. Findings: The findings of this paper raise concerns about ethical and legal challenges related to AI in the marketing area. Ethical concerns related to discrimination, bias, manipulation, job displacement, absence of social interaction, cybersecurity, unintended consequences, environmental impact, privacy and legal issues such as consumer security, responsibility, liability, brand protection, competition law, agreements, data protection, consumer protection and intellectual property rights are discussed in the paper, and their potential solutions are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding the interesting insights gathered from this investigation of the ethical and legal consequences of AI in marketing, it is important to recognise the limits of this research. Initially, the focus of this study is confined to a review of the most important ethical and legal issues pertaining to AI in marketing. Additional possible repercussions, such as those associated with intellectual property, contracts and licencing, should be investigated more deeply in future studies. Despite the fact that this study gives various answers and best practices for tackling the stated ethical and legal concerns, the viability and efficacy of these solutions may differ depending on the context and industry. Thus, more research and case studies are required to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of these solutions in other circumstances. This research is mostly based on a literature review and may not represent the experiences or opinions of all stakeholders engaged in AI-powered marketing. Further study might involve interviews or surveys with marketing professionals, customers and other key stakeholders to offer a full knowledge of the practical difficulties and solutions. Because of the rapid speed of technical progress, AI’s ethical and regulatory ramifications in marketing are continually increasing. Consequently, this work should be a springboard for more research and continuing conversations on this subject. Practical implications: This study’s findings have several practical implications for marketing professionals. Emphasising openness and explainability: Marketing professionals should prioritise transparency in their use of AI, ensuring that customers are fully informed about data collection and utilisation for targeted advertising. By promoting openness and explainability, marketers can foster customer trust and avoid the negative consequences of a lack of transparency. Establishing ethical guidelines: Marketing professionals need to develop ethical rules for the creation and implementation of AI-powered marketing strategies. Adhering to ethical principles ensures compliance with legal norms and aligns with the organisation’s values and ideals. Investing in bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology: To mitigate risks associated with AI in marketing, marketers should allocate resources to develop and implement bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology. These tools can identify and address biases in AI algorithms, safeguard consumer privacy and extract valuable insights from consumer data. Social implications: This study’s social implications emphasise the need for a comprehensive approach to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing. This includes adopting a responsible innovation framework, promoting ethical leadership, using ethical decision-making frameworks and conducting multidisciplinary research. By incorporating these approaches, marketers can navigate the complexities of AI in marketing responsibly, foster an ethical organisational culture, make informed ethical decisions and develop effective solutions. Such practices promote public trust, ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk, and mitigate potential negative social consequences associated with AI in marketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is among the first to explore potential solutions comprehensively. This paper provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges by using a multidisciplinary framework and synthesising various sources. It contributes valuable insights for academia and industry. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI in marketing; Artificial intelligence; Ethical challenges; Legal implications; Marketing; Solution proposals","","","","","","","","Aloqaily M., Kanhere S., Bellavista P., Nogueira M., Special issue on cybersecurity management in the era of AI, Journal of Network and Systems Management, 30, 3, (2022); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., The evolution of Fintech: a new post-crisis paradigm?, Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, 4, pp. 1271-1319, (2016); Borenstein J., Howard A., Emerging challenges in AI and the need for AI ethics education, AI and Ethics, 1, 1, pp. 61-65, (2021); Brown M.E., Trevino L.K., Ethical leadership: a review and future directions, The Leadership Quarterly, 17, 6, pp. 595-616, (2006); Brynjolfsson E., Mitchell T., What can machine learning do?

However, many existing AI chatbots have yet to meet the expectations of solo travelers, especially when they demand more personalized information to assist in travel decision-making. Based on complexity theory, this research examines the factors that stimulate solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, particularly covering the three main aspects of marketing efforts, communication quality, and affective characteristics. Drawing from a sample of 281 solo travelers, partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used to examine the proposed relationships. The PLS-SEM results illustrate that interaction, entertainment, trendiness, communication competence, and satisfaction have significant direct effects on purchase intentions. The fsQCA results further revealed four solutions exhibiting high purchase intentions among solo travelers. Different core, peripheral, and necessary causal conditions in each configuration path were identified. The findings enrich the AI chatbot literature by examining the underlying reasons why solo travelers react differently to this emerging technology and produce practical recommendations for designing AI chatbot systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","AI chatbot; fsQCA; PLS-SEM; Purchase intentions; Solo travelers; Tourism","","","","","","","","Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., Chatbots: History, technology, and applications, Machine Learning with Applications, 2, pp. 1-18, (2020); Aguilera-Caracuel J., Fedriani E.M., Delgado-Marquez B.L., Institutional distance among country influences and environmental performance standardization in multinational enterprises, Journal of Business Research, 67, 11, pp. 2385-2392, (2014); Alonso-Vazquez M., Yang E.C.L., Pages Vidal M.D.M., Khoo C., Going solo during the pandemic: A generational segmentation of solo female travellers, Current Issues in Tourism, pp. 1-15, (2023); Azali M., Kamal Basha N., Chang Y.S., Lim X.J., Cheah J.H., Why not travel to Malaysia?

This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP – namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) – the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF’s effects on CSP. Findings: The authors find that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP’s positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF’s promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implications: This study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF’s effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF’s role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain – namely, core firm–suppliers and core firm–customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implications: First, our findings indicate that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to “do good.” The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/value: This study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm’s competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental; Financial performance; Recipe; social and governance performance; Supply chain finance; Sustainability performance","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71872021, 72172019)","Funding: Our study was supported by the program of Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) “Research on Supply Chain Decision Optimization and Cooperative Management Based on Behavior Analysis of Intelligent Decision Making Robot” (ID: 72172019), and “Research on Robust Intelligent Management of Enterprise Exchange Rate Risk from the Perspective of Supply Chain Cooperation” (ID: 71872021).","Working capital optimization in the supply chain, (2008); Alexopoulos I., Kounetas K., Tzelepis D., Environmental and financial performance.

Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3). Originality/value: Anthropomorphizing AI has undeniable relevance in the contemporary marketing landscape, such as humanoid robotics and emotion AI algorithms. Despite of anthropomorphism's significance and relevance, the downstream impact of anthropomorphism remains unfortunately underexplored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence (AI); Political ideology; Psychological closeness; Psychological risk attachment; Risk aversion","","","","","","","","Abdulquadri A., Mogaji E., Kieu T.A., Nguyen N.P., Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Acikgoz F., Vega R.P., The role of privacy cynicism in consumer habits with voice assistants: a Technology Acceptance Model perspective, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, pp. 1-15, (2022); Aggarwal P., McGill A.L., Is that car smiling at me?

With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision-making literature. Moreover, this study makes practical implications for marketers of AI businesses including those who strategically use AI-generated information. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","AI adoption; AI technology; artificial intelligence; marketing; preciseness; recommendation; trust","","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 6, pp. 734-749, (2005); Aguirre E., Mahr D., Grewal D., de Ruyter K., Wetzels M., Unraveling the personalization paradox: The effect of information collection and trust-building strategies on online advertisement effectiveness, Journal of Retailing, 91, 1, pp. 34-49, (2015); Aljukhadar M., Trifts V., Senecal S., Consumer self-construal and trust as determinants of the reactance to a recommender advice, Psychology & Marketing, 34, 7, pp. 708-719, (2017); Amoroso D., Sauer F., Sharkey N., Suchman L., Tamburrini G., Autonomy in weapon systems: The military application of artificial intelligence as a litmus test for Germany's new foreign and security policy, (2018); Bart Y., Shankar V., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

ChatGPT provides information back to users who populate questions in a clear and easy to understand structure. This technology can be used for different purposes, including writing code, creating business proposals, writing stories and answering complex questions. Because this technology is considered a breakthrough in terms of its ability to process natural language, it stands to reason that it could have future effects on the fundamental digital marketing tactic known as search engine optimisation (SEO), a process by which websites are developed and updated with the goal of increasing natural ranking, traffic and customers from search engines like Google and Bing. For the past 20 years, people have turned to search engines for information, news articles, images, videos and answers to questions both mundane and complex. This technological advance with chatbots could indicate a significant general shift for marketers, specifically related to web searches and how marketers think about SEO. In fact, Microsoft’s decision to invest in ChatGPT and include it within their search engine, Bing, has already created waves in the search engine ecosystems. In this paper, ChatGPT will be examined, its capabilities and how they could affect search marketing and SEO. © Henry Stewart Publications.","chat bots; ChatGPT; digital marketing; search engine marketing; search engine optimisation; search marketing; SEO","","","","","","","","Ruby D., ChatGPT Statistics for 2023: Comprehensive Facts and Data, (2023); Tamkin A., Ganguli D., How Large Language Models Will Transform Science, Society, and AI, (2021); Cheng M., Microsoft Spent over a Decade on the New Bing.Then ChatGPT Happened, Quartz, (2023); Pichai S., An Important Next Step on Our AI Journey, (2023); How Google’s Knowledge Graph Works; Dall-E2, OpenAI; Dhariwal P., Jun H., Payne C., Kim J.W., Radford A., Sutskever I., Jukebox: A Generative Model for Music, (2020); Radford A., Kim J.W., Hallacy C., Ramesh A., Goh G., Agarwal S., Sastry G., Askell A., Mishkin P., Clark J., Krueger G., Sutskever I., Learning Transferable Visual Models from Natural Language Supervision, Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning [Virtual] 2021, PMLR, 139, pp. 8748-8763, (2021); Introducing Whisper, OpenAI; Wiggers K., OpenAI Open-Sources Whisper, a Multilingual Speech Recognition System, TechCrunch, (2022); Model Index for Researchers, OpenAI; Open AI, ChatGPT Blog, OpenAI, (2022); Stiennon N., Ouyang L., Wu J., Ziegler D., Lowe R., Voss C., Radford A., Amodei D., Christiano P.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next wave of transformation in healthcare. This study aims to understand patient perceptions of AI and its impact on value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed to investigate how value co-creation operant resources (digital self-efficacy and relational service quality) impact value co-creation engagement (shared decision-making) and value co-creation outcomes (anticipatory AI value co-creation and intention to adopt AI). Data were collected from 332 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that the value co-creation process for AI technologies is a function of inputs, experiences and AI outputs. Operant resources were found to be positively associated with shared decision-making. However, not all operant resources directly and positively impacted AI outcomes. The indirect and positive mediated relationships through shared decision-making to AI outcomes suggest an interactive AI value co-creation process. Research limitations/implications: AI technologies are still in early stages of consumer adoption in healthcare. Future research is warranted that investigates the validity of the model through maturing service life cycles. Practical implications: Customer perceptions of new digital innovations are formed in the context of previous digital experiences. Marketers need to understand how customers view their current non-AI technologies. Strong engagement and perceived value of current technologies will help ease customers into the usage of AI technologies. Originality/value: This study investigates the unique stages of the value co-creation process for AI technologies in healthcare. The results demonstrate that the value co-creation process is a function of inputs, tech-enabled experiences and AI outputs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Digital transformation; Healthcare; Service-dominant logic; Services marketing","","","","","","","","Abid M.F., Shamim A., Khan Z., Khan I., Value creation or value destruction: conceptualizing the experiential nature of value-in-use, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 21, 3, pp. 583-601, (2022); Akbar P., Mai R., Hoffmann S., When do materialistic consumers join commercial sharing systems, Journal of Business Research, 69, 10, pp. 4215-4224, (2016); Akaka M.A., Parry G., Value-in-context: an exploration of the context of value and the value of context, Handbook of Service Science, 2, pp. 457-477, (2019); Barile S., Bassano C., Piciocchi P., Saviano M., Spohrer J.C., Empowering value co-creation in the digital age, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, (2021); Barnes S., De Ruyter K., Guest editorial: artificial intelligence as a market-facing technology: getting closer to the consumer through innovation and insight, European Journal of Marketing, 56, 6, pp. 1585-1589, (2022); Chandler J.D., Vargo S.L., Contextualization and value-in-context: how context frames exchange, Marketing Theory, 11, 1, pp. 35-49, (2011); Dahl A.J., Milne G.R., Peltier J.W., Digital health information seeking in an omni-channel environment: a shared decision-making and service-dominant logic perspective, Journal of Business Research, 125, pp. 840-850, (2021); Dahl A.J., Peltier J.W., Milne G.R., Development of a value co-creation wellness model: the role of physicians and digital information seeking on health behaviors and health outcomes, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 52, 3, pp. 562-594, (2018); Dahl A.J., Peltier J.W., Milne G.R., Reducing information asymmetry and increasing health value co-creation in a rural healthcare context, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 56, 2, pp. 512-535, (2022); Dahl A.J., Peltier J.W., Swan E.L., Anticipatory value-in-use in early-stage digital health service transformations: how consumers assess value propositions before and after abrupt, exogenous shocks, Journal of Business Research, 163, (2023); Dodds S., Russell-Bennett R., Chen T., Oertzen A.-S., Salvador-Carulla L., Hung Y.-C., Blended human-technology service realities in healthcare, Journal of Service Theory and Practice, 32, 1, pp. 75-99, (2022); Gao L., Li G., Tsai F., Gao C., Zhu M., Qu X., The impact of artificial intelligence stimuli on customer engagement and value co-creation: the moderating role of customer ability readiness, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 317-333, (2023); Gronroos C., Service logic revisited: who creates value?

This poses a challenge for marketers because negative properties not only weigh heavily on consumers' technology adoption decisions but potentially do more so than positive ones. To shed light on the paradox of technology and its underlying processes, the present research develops a conceptual model drawing on technology adoption and valence perception theories about the prevalence of negativity bias in consumers' technology adoption decisions with its unique effect through the serial chain of consumers' perceptions of risk and trust regarding the technology. Results of three studies (N = 1309) demonstrate that the effect of negative valence consistently outperforms that of positive valence in consumers' technology adoption intentions (Studies 1–2) and decisions (Study 3). Furthermore, results show that the disproportionate effect of negative (vs. positive) valence can be explained by the proposed serial causal chain through consumers' perception of risk of the technology and trust in the technology (Studies 2–3) while ruling out company trust and consumer knowledge as alternative drivers of the effects (Study 3). These findings contribute to the pertinent literature on consumer psychology in decisions to adopt novel technologies in that they quantify and explain the potential outcome stemming from the ambiguous properties of novel technology. Moreover, this study finds negativity bias to be an often overlooked consumer bias with implications for marketing practice and useful for understanding and lowering resistance towards artificial intelligence technology. © 2022 The Authors.

With a focus on enhancing product and service quality, we investigate the intricate relationships among these variables. A quantitative approach involving 380 supply chain professionals reveals that heightened inventory competition, increased AI adoption, and robust digital marketing significantly contribute to quality enhancement initiatives. The study builds upon prior research by empirically validating these connections and offers practical insights for supply chain practitioners. The findings underscore the strategic imperative of organizations to strategically balance these factors to optimize their quality management strategies, fostering customer satisfaction and competitiveness. While offering valuable contributions, the study acknowledges limitations in terms of self-reported data and a specific respondent group. Future research could extend this investigation to diverse industries and geographical contexts. In the end, this study sheds light on the complex interplay that exists between inventory competition, the use of AI, digital marketing, and judgments about quality improvement. As a result, a road map has been provided for efficient quality management of supply chains in the digital age. © 2023 Growing Science Ltd.

Although the term originally emerged with Court et al. in 2009, the various current perspectives of the consumer journey suggest the existence of distinct literature and theoretical roots that have yet to be fully explored in detail. The objective of the paper is to semi-systematically review the main theories and models that constitute the foundation on which the consumer journey has evolved. Furthermore, given the lack of academic studies reflecting on the influence of more recent technologies based on artificial intelligence on the consumer journey, this study aims to fill this gap in an attempt to mold further theory development around the consumer journey concept. 74 relevant papers were retrieved mainly from a detailed search on SCOPUS, as well as a backward and forward citation analysis. A thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three literature streams that contribute to the consumer journey literature. This represents a furthering of the theoretical knowledge regarding the consumer journey and its foundations. By also discussing a future perspective, a holistic and comprehensive basis is provided to structure and assist how marketing managers can perceive the consumer decision journey. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Classical consumer behavior models; Consumer decision journey; Decision analysis; Hierarchy of effects; Semi-systematic literature review","Consumer behavior; Decision making; 'current; Classical consumer behavior model; Consumer decision journey; Consumer decision making; Decision-making process; Future perspectives; Hierarchy of effect; Literature reviews; Semi-systematic literature review; Theory and modeling; artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; decision making; hierarchical system; holistic approach; literature review; marketing; model test; theoretical study; travel behavior; Decision theory","","","","","ISEG; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/04521/2020); Universidade de Lisboa, ULisboa","This work was supported by FCT , I.P., the Portuguese national funding agency for science, research, and technology, under Project UIDB/04521/2020 , Universidade de Lisboa, and ISEG.

The study uses a sample of 127 SMEs from Bangladesh. Data were collected by sending out questionnaires electronically and by mail. Smart PLS (SEM) 3.0 was used to analyse the data following the quantitative method. The study reveals positive and significant relationships between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, opportunity development and opportunity exploitation with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. It also claims that entrepreneurial passion mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and opportunity development with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. However, entrepreneurial passion does not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation and entrepreneurial marketing decisions. The study offers researchers a broader and more wide-ranging view of the importance of artificial intelligence in small firms. Researchers, educators and practitioners will benefit from the findings.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer’s perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers’ intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Antecedents;

Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived. Marketers should optimize the mix and timing of AI-HI marketing team, consumers should understand the complementarity between AI and HI strengths for informed consumption decisions, and researchers can investigate innovative approaches to and boundary conditions of collaborative intelligence. © 2021 New York University","Artificial intelligence; Augmentation; Collaborative AI; Collaborative intelligence; Replacement","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","This research was supported by grants (106-2410-H-002-056-MY3 and 107-2410-H-002-115-MY3) from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Antons D., Breidbach C.F., Big Data, Big Insights?

As such, online communities that are supported by AI technologies creating new knowledge from consumer interactions through platforms like social media as consumers share experiences on specific products or services. Since AI is designed to &#x201C;learn&#x201D; and improve with data generated from digital technologies linked to consumer interactions, AI relies on consumer knowledge-sharing (KS) activities to replicate new knowledge for product and service improvement. However, given the knowledge gap in this area, this article applies the fsQCA technique to data generated from 291 participants to develop CB metaframework predicted on the concepts of AI, CB, and KS. Our results suggest that AI advances consumer attitudes and behaviors when knowledge is acquired while online communities promote curiosity and engage consumers to learn by sharing experiences about specific products or services. Furthermore, understanding the causality between AI, CB, and KS concepts offers critical decision-making insights to marketing experts across the industry.

The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

This systematic review focuses on the evolving research area of Social Opinion Mining, tasked with the identification of multiple opinion dimensions, such as subjectivity, sentiment polarity, emotion, affect, sarcasm and irony, from user-generated content represented across multiple social media platforms and in various media formats, like text, image, video and audio. Through Social Opinion Mining, natural language can be understood in terms of the different opinion dimensions, as expressed by humans. This contributes towards the evolution of Artificial Intelligence which in turn helps the advancement of several real-world use cases, such as customer service and decision making. A thorough systematic review was carried out on Social Opinion Mining research which totals 485 published studies and spans a period of twelve years between 2007 and 2018. The in-depth analysis focuses on the social media platforms, techniques, social datasets, language, modality, tools and technologies, and other aspects derived. Social Opinion Mining can be utilised in many application areas, ranging from marketing, advertising and sales for product/service management, and in multiple domains and industries, such as politics, technology, finance, healthcare, sports and government. The latest developments in Social Opinion Mining beyond 2018 are also presented together with future research directions, with the aim of leaving a wider academic and societal impact in several real-world applications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Emotion analysis; Irony detection; Microblogs; Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Sarcasm detection; Sentiment analysis; Social data; Social data analysis; Social media; Social networks; Social opinion mining; Subjectivity analysis; Survey; Systematic review","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision making; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Customer services; Future research directions; Latest development; Multiple channels; Social interactions; Social media platforms; Tools and technologies; User-generated content; Text mining","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2106); ADAPT - Centre for Digital Content Technology","This work is funded by the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology which is funded under the SFI Research Centres Programme (Grant No. 13/RC/2106).

Recent advances in this form of artificial intelligence has been suggested to allow content creators and managers to transcend their tasks from creation towards editing, thus overcoming a common problem: the tyranny of the blank screen. In this research, we address this topic by proposing a novel system design that will suggest engagement-driven message features as well as automatically generate critical and fully written unique Tweet message components for the goal of maximizing the probability of relatively high engagement levels. Our multi-methods design relies on the use of econometrics, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics, all of which are widely used in the emerging fields of Business and Marketing Analytics. Our system design is intended to analyze Tweet messages for the purpose of generating the most critical components and structure of Tweets. We propose econometric models to judge the quality of written Tweets by way of engagement-level prediction, as well as a generative probability model for the auto-generation of Tweet messages. Testing of our design demonstrates the need to take into account the contextual, semantic, and syntactic features of messages, while controlling for individual user characteristics, so that generated Tweet components and structure maximizes the potential engagement levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian statistics; Business analytics; Marketing analytics; Natural language generation; Tweet generation; Tweet suggestion","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Economics; Managers; Semantics; Statistics; Systems analysis; Bayesian statistics; Component generation; Critical component; Econometric model; Engagement levels; Probability modeling; Syntactic features; User characteristics; Structural design","","","","","","","Zadeh A.H., Sharda R., Modeling brand post popularity dynamics in online social networks, Decis.

Methodology: Time series of daily sales between the years 2017 and 2019 of 10 retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector were considered. Methods based on machine learning were used and the forecasting models were increased with numerical variables from the official profile of the company, from the posting made by the contracted digital influencer and the characteristics of the images posted by the digital influencer were included in the models. Relevance and Originality: The study is innovative, as it goes beyond qualitative reflections on the theme and provides empirical evidence regarding the impacts on forecast accuracy from the inclusion of social media variables. A data fusion strategy (numerics and images) was also presented to forecast daily sales of retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Main results: The models proved to be efficient in forecasting and the importance of the likes and engagement variables reinforces the idea that the identification and social reference generated by the ID are important aspects in the purchase decision process. It was found that the images are responsible for adding exclusive attributes that help in forecasting and understanding the patterns of the sales series. Theoretical and methodological contributions:The study showed in a promising way the efficiency of methods based on machine learning in forecasting sales from Instagram data, especially with regard to the incorporation and extraction of image data. © 2021 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

The research presents a case analysis of an award-winning Spot that uses artificial intelligence as the basis of the creative idea. Its objective is to assess the extent to which the implementation of this resource is pertinent in eliciting emotions, influencing brand awareness and perception, and fostering a favorable attitude towards the brand. For the analysis, a neuromarketing technique has been used, the Implicit Association Test, complemented with in-depth interviews and a CAWI survey. The results suggest that the use of AI in the creation of advertising messages favors the generation of positive attitudes toward the brand since it enhances the strength of the message transmitted, but it does not seem to influence the brand image or the intention to consume it. © 2023, Rey Juan Carlos University.

The integration of AI has brought numerous benefits to various functional areas within organizations, with marketing experiencing a significant positive impact. AI technologies have empowered marketers with advanced tools and insights, fostering unparalleled efficiency, personalization, and strategic campaign decision-making. Despite these advancements, the scholarly focus on AI's transformative effects on marketing is limited. This research investigates how AI is currently applied across different marketing functions and its potential future evolution and impact on marketing processes. In a rapidly evolving world, businesses must navigate complexity, innovate, and sustain competitive advantages. Grounding our analysis in previous AI marketing literature, we adopt the dynamic capability theoretical lens, emphasizing how organizations adapt and prosper in changing environments. This study highlights six key marketing areas where AI promises transformative effects, aiming to illuminate the path for future marketing innovations and strategies, including AI-driven customer insights, measuring marketing performance, automated marketing strategies, ethical implications, enhancing customer experiences, and growth opportunities with AI Implementation.

As such, the value of digital business management has received considerable attention from industrial practitioners. Beyond conventional promotion techniques, collaboration with digital market influencers has shown significant potential for business organisations by creating a circle of trust. However, managing influencers in the business-to-business market is far more complex than in business-to-consumer markets, as it involves balancing business processes, competitive advantages, company image and risks rather than solely motivating customer engagement. It is, therefore, critical for organisations to carefully select key opinion leaders (KOLs). To address this challenge, this study introduces an intelligent multi-criteria KOL analytics framework that embeds the fuzzy best-worst method and the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. The framework converts subjective and linguistic criteria, determines the attribute most relevant to the business, and then selects the most suitable KOLs for the campaign. A case study was conducted in partnership with a digital marketing agency in Hong Kong to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this approach. This model facilitates the evolution of digital business management by systematically identifying and assessing KOLs, contributing to significant changes in the digital business environment for companies. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Business-to-business; Digital business management; Key opinion leaders; Multi-criteria decision-making","","","","","","Big Data Intelligence Centre at the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong; University Grants Committee of Hong Kong SAR; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (UGC/FDS14/E04/21); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong SAR, (700011, 700043)","Funding text 1: The work described in this paper was partially supported by the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong SAR, under the Faculty Development Scheme (Project Ref.

As the customer base grows, insurance companies must prioritize transitioning to data-driven strategies to cut costs and make more informed marketing choices in today's digital era. This study proposes a new decision-making framework for precision marketing, based on a real case study from a Moroccan insurance company that aims to solve a practical problem. The proposed decision-making system consists of four components, with each component involving important steps. Firstly, data preparation was performed, consisting of four critical stages: data acquisition, data cleaning and filtering, feature selection, and oversampling. Secondly, top 20% and top 50% consumers are taken as examples to present their customer persona in detail. Based on the processed data, we analysed consumer consumption behaviors using four ML algorithms and made a performance comparison of the four algorithms. Additionally, we conducted feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features and evaluate the system's performance. The aim of the proposed precision decision-making system is to assist managers in discerning the distinctive characteristics of potential customers and proposing tailored precision marketing strategies. This approach is expected to substantially reduce advertising expenses and enhance overall marketing efficiency. A case study using real-world data from a Moroccan insurance company was conducted to demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed framework. The results of the study indicate that the proposed system yielded favourable outcomes. © 2024 The Authors","Decision making system; Insurance sector; Machine learning; MRMR; Precision marketing; Relief","","","","","","","","Adiwijaya K., Wahyuni S., Gayatri G., Mussry J.S., Does marketing ambidexterity boost marketing performance?

This paper aims at exploring the farmers’ intention to adopt smart farming technologies (SFT). Also, the authors intend to know how far the belief of farmers on land as God influences their decision to adopt SFT. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from 500 farmers chosen purposively. A well-crafted survey instrument was employed to amass data from farmers for measuring their adoption of SFT. As the authors sought to measure the farmers’ behavioural intention (BI) towards the adoption of SFT, the technology acceptance model developed by Davis (1989) came in handy, including perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and BI. The authors have adopted this model as it was considered a superior model. The items on the attitude of confidence (AC) were adapted from Adrian et al. (2005). Survey instruments of Thompson and Higgins (1991) and Compeau and Higgins (1995) were also referred to finalize the statements relating to attitude towards use. Moreover, the authors developed items relating to the perceived belief of land as God based on frequent interaction with the farmers. Findings: The study results divulged that attitude to use (AU) is directly influenced by the rural farmers’ PU, PEU and AC. Similarly, this investigation has observed behaviour intention directly influenced by the AU of farmers. It is observed that AU was the most influential variable, which ultimately influenced the BI to use SFT. Research limitations/implications: This study has an important limitation in the form of representing only the culture, belief and value system of farmers in India. Practical implications: The outcome of this study will facilitate the policymakers to draw suitable policy measures keeping the sensitivities of the farmers in mind in their technology adoption drive. The agricultural officers can encourage farmers to take logical decisions by supplying adequate information in a time-bound manner. Marketers can make suitable adjustments in their sales and promotion activities that focus on farmers. Social implications: The belief of farmers on land as God has a small yet unmissable influence on farmers’ AU and BI in their technology adoption decision. Based on the above evidence, the authors recommend that marketers fine-tune their product design, product packaging and promotional activities keeping the belief and sensitivities of farmers at the core of their marketing campaign. Originality/value: This article provides original insights by demonstrating the positive influence of PU, PEU and AC on technology adoption by farmers. This research is the first of a kind linking the belief of farmers on land as God with smart farming technology adoption in farming. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agriculture; Land as God; Rural farmers;

Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework is successful, with higher accuracies and good performance. Results revealed that customer service & marketing tactics are essential for a Company’ success & survival. Also, the C4.5 has accomplished better achievement than the SVM, RF, LR, NB, & ID3. At the end, CIoT Platform was evaluated by response time, request rate & processing of bank data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Analysis; Artificial intelligence (AI); CIoT; Data of bank; Marketing; SDM","Cloud analytics; Commerce; Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Marketing; Support vector machines; Analyse; Artificial intelligence; Cloud internet of thing; Data of bank; Logistics regressions; Marketing information; Naive bayes; Performance; Smart data mining; SMART datum; Internet of things","","","","","","","Bai Y., Zhao M., Li R., Xin P., A new data mining method for time series in visual analysis of regional economy, Information Processing & Management, 59, 1, (2022); Huang M.H., Rust R.T., A strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 49, 1, pp. 30-50, (2021); Li W., Big Data Precision Marketing Approach under IoT Cloud Platform Information Mining, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022); Elsalamony H.A., Bank direct marketing analysis of data mining techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 85, 7, pp. 12-22, (2014); Lai M., Smart financial management system based on data ming and man-machine management, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2022, (2022); Elsalamony H.A., Elsayad A.M., Bank direct marketing based on neural network and C5. 0 Models, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology (IJEAT), 2, 6, (2013); Kim S., Suh Y., Lee H., What IoT devices and applications should be connected?

But how can the brands shield themselves from scandals and other limitations of human influencers? The solution for many companies has involved robots. Virtual influencers (VI) are virtual robots that can emulate human appearance and behaviour and have become a trend in marketing. This study analyses how non-human influencers affect marketing communication by adopting two methods that are unpublished in the investigation of this phenomenon: a systematic literature review and netnography in conjunction with in-depth interviews with specialists resulting in the study identifying five categories (two of which are unpublished and unexplored in the literature) that can facilitate management decisions and also future studies around VIs: anthropomorphism/humanization, attractiveness, authenticity, scalability, and controllability. This study also identified more convergences than divergences between the virtual and the real and between humans and non-humans, generating challenges, opportunities, and guidelines for future research and for assisting management in making decisions concerning digital marketing. © 2021, Australasian Journal of Information Systems.","artificial intelligence; digital marketing; exploratory study; robots; virtual influencers; virtualization","","","","","","","","Alexander J., Virtual creators aren’t AI — but AI is coming for them, (2019); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.

Based on a comprehensive literature review, the combined strategies were used to develop a novel decision-making framework. The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making. The use of a novel three-phase decision-making framework which uses AI processes improves operational efficiency, increases insights and enhances the decision accuracy of complex problems at the strategic level in industries such as manufacturing. It could help operations executives to apply effective decisions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Understanding consumers’ approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies’ choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media. Findings: Trust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most. Research limitations/implications: The introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars. Practical implications: For businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on “who should certify AI” from a consumer perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first to introduce the topic of AI certification to the marketing/social media literature, provide a novel guideline to scholars and offer the first set of empirical studies examining consumer approval of AI certifications. © 2023, Myrthe Blösser and Andrea Weihrauch.","AI certification; AI regulation; Artificial intelligence; Consumer trust; Fair AI","","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (KIVI.2019.006); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

Consumers’ use of connected devices is providing rich sources of data about consumers, their activity, and their environment, which we collectively label customer intelligence. At the same time, changes in statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence are making automated inferences and decisions regarding consumer behavior possible. One likely result of these changes is the emergence of companies that are especially adept at generating and using customer intelligence. This article explores how changes in sensing technology, causal modeling, and intelligent marketing platforms may affect the generation and utilization of customer intelligence. We envision a merging of these tradition-ally separate activities in companies that possess a large, active customer base and the ability to collect, process, and apply data from these customers quickly and accurately. Such a convergence offers substantial potential value but also notable risk for tomorrow’s connected consumers. © 2017 the Association for Consumer Research.

AIVAs now handle many different everyday tasks and are also increasingly assisting consumers with purchasing decisions, making AIVAs a rich topic for marketing researchers. We develop a series of propositions regarding how consumer decision-making processes may change when moved from traditional online purchase environments to AI-powered voice-based dialogs, in the hopes of encouraging further academic thinking and research in this rapidly developing, high impact area of consumer-firm interaction. We also provide suggestions for marketing managers and policymakers on points to pay attention to when they respond to the proposed effects of AIVAs on consumer decisions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Consumer decision-making; Consumer dialogs; Consumer models; Digital marketing; Voice assistants","","","","","","Vereniging Trustfonds Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam","","Alba J.W., Hutchinson J.W., Dimensions of consumer expertise, Journal of Consumer Research, 13, 4, pp. 411-454, (1987); Arentze T.A., Dellaert B.G.C., Chorus C.G., Incorporating mental representations in discrete choice models of travel behavior: Modeling approach and empirical application, Transportation Science, 49, 3, pp. 577-590, (2015); Baker T., Dellaert B., Regulating Robo advice across the financial services industry, Iowa Law Review, 103, pp. 713-750, (2018); Castelo N., Bos M.W., Lehmann D.R., Task-dependent algorithm aversion, Journal of Marketing Research, 56, 5, pp. 809-825, (2019); Castelo N., Schmitt B., Sarvary M., Human or robot?

This article explores the development of user generated content and specifically the use of web logs or blogs. Tourism organisations cannot afford to ignore the development of user generated content, peer-to-peer web applications and virtual communities. A recent survey found that consumers trusted more websites with reviews than professional guides and travel agencies and far from being an irrelevance, blogs are often perceived to be more credible and trustworthy than traditional marketing communications. But there is a problem: given the sheer number of possibly relevant travel blogs there is a need to locate, extract and interpret blog content and this has proven so far to be time consuming, exhausting and costly, thus negating the relative value of the information obtained. A way forward may be the use of artificial intelligence and ""opinion mining"" or a blog visualisation system.","Blogs; Internet; Marketing; Tourism; Travel; User generated content","","","","","","","","Adam J., Cobos X., Liu S., Travel 2.0: Trends in Industry Awareness and Adoption, (2007); Albert T.C., Sanders W.B., E-Business Marketing, (2003); Beaumont C., Tweet, tweet, here comes Twitter, The Telegraph, (2008); Buhalis D., Tourism distribution channels: Practices and processes, Practices, Issues and Transformations, 2nd Edn., pp. 7-32, (2001); Bulkeley W., Marketers scan blogs for brand insights, Wall Str J, (2005); Carson D., Marshall S., Taylor W., Yu X., An overview of developing regional tourism using information communications technology, Encyclopaedia of Developing Regional Communities with Information and Communication Technology, (2005); Carson D., The blogosphere as a market research tool for tourism destinations: A case study of Australia's Northern Territory, J Vacat Mark, 14, 2, pp. 111-119, (2008); Celik D., Elci A., Discovery and scoring of semantic web services based on client requirement(S) through a semantic search agent, Proceedings - International Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2, pp. 273-278, (2006); Choi S., Lehto X.Y., Morrison A.M., Destination image representation on the web: Content analysis of Macau travel related websites, Tourism Management, 28, 1, pp. 118-129, (2007); Cobanoglu C., An analysis of blogs as a teaching tool as perceived by hospitality management students, J Hosp Leis Sport Tour Educ, 5, 2, pp. 83-88, (2006); Crotts J., Mansfield Y., Pizam A., Consumer decision making and prepurchase information search, Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism, pp. 149-168, (1999); Dellaert B., Tourists' valuation of other tourists' contribution to travel web sites, Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Information and Communication Technologies, pp. 293-302, (2000); Dellarocas C., The digitization of word of mouth: Promise and challenges of online feedback mechanisms, Manag Sci, 49, 10, pp. 1407-1424, (2003); Douglas A.C., Mills J.E., Hitz M., Sigala M., Murphy J., Loggging brand personality online: Website content analysis of Middle Eastern and North African destinations, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2006, (2006); UK Online Travel: Travellers Are Sharing Experiences Online, (2007); Online Distribution Channels on the Move, (2007); Web 2.0 and the travel industry: Practical strategies for exploiting the social media revolution, White Paper, (2007); Gaskell K., Virtual Tourism Takes off in Second Life, (2007); Gitleson R., Kerstetter D., The influence of friends and relatives in travel decision making, J Travel Tour Mark, 3, 3, pp. 59-68, (1994); Gobbi J., Sponsored blogs and the conflict of interests, Zirma-travel, Communications and Mobilities, (2005); Gretzel U., Yoo K.H., Purifoy M., Online Travel Review Study: Role and Impact of Online Travel Reviews, (2007); Hennig-Thurau T., Gwinner K.P., Walsh G., Gremler D.D., Electronic word-of-mouth via consumer-opinion platforms: What motivates consumers to articulate themselves on the Internet?, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 18, 1, pp. 38-52, (2004); User Generated Comments: Travel Brands Most at Risk, (2007); Johnson T.J., Kaye B.K., Wag the blog: How reliance on traditional media and the Internet influence credibility perceptions of Weblogs among blog users, Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 81, 3, pp. 622-642, (2004); Kelleher T., Miller B.M., Organizational blogs and the human voice: Relational strategies and relational outcomes, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11, 2, pp. 1-26, (2006); Laboy F., Torchio P., Web 2.0 for the Travel Marketer and Consumer: A White Paper, (2007); Laws E., Distribution channel analysis for leisure travel, Practices, Issues and Transformations, 2nd Edn., pp. 53-72, (2001); Lew A., Why don't we blog?

This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization.

The purpose of this article is to show what artificial intelligence (AI) tools - expert systems - can actually be used for administrative decision in public administration. The end of the administrative decision must be justified in detail according to the legal regulations. Expert systems do this. The other large group of AI tools, solutions based on machine learning, act as black boxes, mapping input data to output data, so the reason for the solution is unknown. Therefore, these tools are not suitable for direct, administrative decision, but can support office work with expert systems. In this article, we present the operation of expert systems through examples. © 2021 Brepols Publishers.

Consequently, market-driven product design and development has become a popular topic in the literature. However, past research neither covers all of the major influencing factors that together drive customers to make purchase decisions, nor connects these various influencing factors to customer purchasing behavior. Past studies further fail to take the time value of money and customer value into consideration. This study proposes a decision support system to (a) predict customer purchasing behavior given certain product, customer, and marketing influencing factors, and (b) estimate the net customer lifetime value from customer purchasing behavior toward a specific product. This will not only enable decision-makers to compare alternatives and select competitive products to launch on the market, but will also improve the understanding of customer behavior toward particular products for the formulation of effective marketing strategies that increase customer loyalty and generate greater profits in the long term. Decision-makers can also make use of the system to build up confidence in new product development in terms of idea generation and product improvement.

This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating the “doubling” procedure to deal with percentile data. Practical implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of art collectors that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating a non-traditional application of correspondence analysis using the “doubling” procedure. Buyer behavior in the fine art market is not exhaustively studied. By understanding the personality traits of consumers in the art market, sales forces can better provide assistance and product to consumers. Further, understanding the personalities of consumers is better for art retail spaces to better serve consumers. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates a unique mixed methods approach to analyzing unstructured qualitative data. It shows how text data can be used to identify measurable market segments for which targeted strategies can be developed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Art collectors; Artificial intelligence; Automated text analysis; Correspondence analysis; Psychographic consumer segmentation; Psychographic segmentation; Quantitative analysis of qualitative data","","","","","","","","Amabile T.M., Phillips E.D., Collins M.A., Creativity by contract: social influences on the creativity of professional fine artists, Annual Meeting of the American Psychological Association, (1993); Arnould E.J., Price L., Moisio R., Making contexts matter: Selecting research contexts for theoretical insights, Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, pp. 106-125, (2006); Belk R., Collecting as luxury consumption: effects on individuals and households, Journal of Economic Psychology, 16, 3, pp. 477-490, (1995); Bendixen M.T., Correspondence Analysis, (1991); Bourdieu P., The forms of capital, The Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 241-258, (1986); Chamorro-Premuzic T., Reimers S., Hsu A., Ahmetoglu G., Who art thou?

The major ingredients for deciding where to locate branch-banks are: growth rates of deposits and loans; degree of competition; easy accessibility, and operating costs of potential sites. These are often highly sensitive to socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that are ill-defined and fuzzy in nature. Accordingly, the traditional normative approach alone cannot analyze the excessive location-related data associated with the external factors and cannot appropriately evaluate behavioral criteria for branch-bank sites. In order to overcome these difficulties, this paper develops an interactive fuzzy goal programming model embedded within a locational decision support system for branch-banks. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model-based DSS, it has been applied to establish real-world-like location scenarios for commercial branch-banks in Columbus, Ohio. © 1989.","Decision support systems; Fuzzy multicriteria decision making; Retail location","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Location; Operating costs; Decision Theory and Analysis; Marketing--Management; Mathematical Techniques--Fuzzy Sets; Behavioral factors; Columbus; External factors; Fuzzy goal-programming model; Fuzzy multicriteria decision making; Highly sensitive; Model-based; Potential sites; Real-world; Retail location; Socio-economic; Banks Location; Decision Support Systems; Multicriteria Decision Making; Decision making; Management","","","","","","","Bandyopadhyay, Operational Research in Development Banking in India, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, 1, pp. 8-25, (1978); Bell, Zabriskie, Assisting Marketing Decisions by Computer Mapping A Branch Banking Application, Journal of Marketing Research, 15, pp. 122-128, (1978); Carter, Cohen, The Use of Simulation in Selecting Branch Banks, Industrial Management Review, 8, 2, pp. 55-69, (1967); Clawson, Fitting Branch Locations Performance Standards and Marketing Strategies to Local Conditions, Journal of Marketing, 38, pp. 8-14, (1974); Doyle, Fenwick, Savage, Model for Evaluating Branch Location and Performance, Journal of Bank Research, 12, pp. 90-95, (1981); Dyer, Mulvey, Integrating Optimization Models with Information Systems for Decision Support, Building Decision Support Systems, (1983); Fabozzi, Trovato, The Use of Quantitative Techniques in Commercial Banks, Journal of Bank Research, 6, pp. 173-178, (1976); Hannan, On Fuzzy Goal Programming, Decision Sciences, 12, pp. 522-531, (1981); IBM Mathematical Programming System Extended/370 Program Reference Manual, (1979); Jelassi, Jarke, Stohr, Designing a Generalized Multicriteria Decision Support System, Journal of Management Information Systems, 1, 4, pp. 24-43, (1985); Keen, Scott-Morton, Decision Support Systems: An Organizational Perspective, (1978); Kim, Mueller, Factor Analysis: Statistical Methods and Practical Issues, (1978); Kramer, Forecasting Branch Bank Growth Patterns, Journal of Bank Research, 1, 4, pp. 17-24, (1971); Minch, Sanders, Computerized Information Systems Supporting Multicriteria Decision Making, Decision Sciences, 17, 3, pp. 395-423, (1986); Narasimhan, Goal Programming in a Fuzzy Environment, Decision Sciences, 11, pp. 325-336, (1980); Robertson, Bellenger, Identifying Bank Market Segments, Journal of Bank Research, 7, pp. 276-283, (1977); Schilling, Revelle, Cohon, An Approach to the Display and Analysis of Multiobjective Problems, Socio-Econ.

Retailers in consumer products industry are getting shorter lead time to respond to market demand. To meet this challenge, many rely on third party supply chain managers (SCMs) for economically supplying required quantities of finished products quickly. However, due to shorter time to market, the SCM has to procure raw materials and start production process based on expected demand. Since SCM absorbs financial penalties associated with under-and over-estimation of demand from retailer, finding an optimal production lot size and product customisation strategy are essential to an SCM's operation. We develop a profit maximisation model and provide a close-form solution that allows an SCM to calculate optimal production lot size. The model is used to examine profitability of postponing product customisation. Finally, the effect of demand variation on SCM's profitability is explored. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","customisation postponement; decision support system; demand uncertainty; supply chain manager","Artificial intelligence; Consumer products; Decision support systems; Managers; Marketing; Optimization; Product development; Profitability; Customisation; Demand uncertainty; Demand variations; Finished products; Global supply chain; Optimal production; Product customisation; Production process; Supply chains","","","","","","","Acar Y., Kadipasaoglu S., Schipperijn P., A decision support framework for global supply chain modelling: An assessment of the impact of demand, supply and lead-time uncertainties on performance, International Journal of Production Research, 48, 11, pp. 3245-3268, (2010); Adamides E.D., Et al., Supporting collaboration in the development and management of lean supply networks, Production Planning and Control, 19, 1, pp. 35-52, (2008); Arroyo-Lopez P.E., Bitran G.R., Coordination of Supply Chain Networks and the Emergence of Mini-maestros, (2007); Bitran G.R., Gurumurthi S., Sam S.L., The need for third-party coordination in supply chain governance, MIT Sloan Management Review, 48, 3, pp. 30-37, (2007); Bruce M., Daly L., Adding value: Challenges for UK apparel supply chain management-A review, Production Planning and Control, 22, 3, pp. 210-220, (2011); Chen K., Xiao T., Demand disruption and coordination of the supply chain with a dominant retailer, European Journal of Operational Research, 197, 1, pp. 225-234, (2009); Christopher M., Towill D., An integrated model for design of integrated supply chain, Logistics and Supply Chain Management, 31, 4, pp. 235-246, (2001); Davis T., Effective supply chain management, Sloan Management Review, 34, 4, pp. 35-46, (1993); Drake M.J., Marley K.A., The Evolution of Quick Response, pp. 3-22, (2010); Feitzinger E., Lee H.L., Mass Customization at Hewlett-Packard: The Power of Postponement, pp. 116-121, (1997); Flynn B.B., Huo B., Zhao X., The impact of supply chain integration on performance: A contingency and configuration approach, Journal of Operations Management, 28, pp. 58-71, (2010); Forza C., Vinelli A., Quick response in the textile apparel industry, Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 8, 3, pp. 125-136, (1997); Gao G., Hitt L., Information technology and product variety: Evidence from panel data, Proceedings of the Twenty-fifth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 365-378, (2004); Gereffi G., Humphrey J., Sturgeon T., The governance of global value chains, Review of International Political Economy, 12, 1, pp. 78-104, (2005); Lambert D.M., Cooper M.C., Issues in supply chain management, Industrial Marketing Management, 29, 1, pp. 65-83, (2000); Lee .

This article introduces the social customer journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by explicitly integrating the important role that social others play throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of “traveling companions,” who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages. Finally, the authors discuss several actionable marketing implications relevant to organizations’ engagement in the social customer journey, including managing influencers, shaping social interactions, and deploying technologies. © American Marketing Association 2020.","customer experience; customer journey; joint consumption; social distance; social influence","","","","","","","","Raj A., Rebecca D., Hu Michael Y., Krush Michael T., Social Media: Influencing Customer Satisfaction in B2B Sales, Industrial Marketing Management, 53, pp. 172-180, (2016); Akhtar O., Christian Wheeler S., Belief in the Immutability of Attitudes Both Increases and Decreases Advocacy, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 111, 4, pp. 475-492, (2016); Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The Social Influence of Brand Community: Evidence from European Car Clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Allcott H., Rogers T., The Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Behavioral Interventions: Experimental Evidence from Energy Conservation, American Economic Review, 104, 10, pp. 3003-3037, (2014); Anderson E.T., Simester D.I., Are Sale Signs Less Effective When More Products Have Them?, Marketing Science, 20, 2, pp. 121-142, (2001); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The Future of Social Media in Marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, pp. 79-95, (2020); Argo J.J., Dahl D.W., Social Influence in the Retail Context: A Contemporary Review of the Literature, Journal of Retailing, (2020); Argo J.J., Dahl D.W., Manchanda R.V., The Influence of a Mere Social Presence in a Retail Context, Journal of Consumer Research, 32, 2, pp. 207-212, (2005); Ariely D., Levav J., Sequential Choice in Group Settings: Taking the Road Less Traveled and Less Enjoyed, Journal of Consumer Research, 27, 3, pp. 279-290, (2000); Ashworth L., Darke P.R., Schaller M., No One Wants to Look Cheap: Trade-offs Between Social Disincentives and the Economic and Psychological Incentives to Redeem Coupons, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 15, 4, pp. 295-306, (2005); Barasch A., Berger J., Broadcasting and Narrowcasting: How Audience Size Affects What People Share, Journal of Marketing Research, 51, 3, pp. 286-299, (2014); Belch G.E., Belch M.A., Advertising and Promotion: An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective, (2015); Berger J., Heath C., Where Consumers Diverge from Others: Identity Signaling and Product Domains, Journal of Consumer Research, 34, 2, pp. 121-134, (2007); Berger J., Ward M., Subtle Signals of Inconspicuous Consumption, Journal of Consumer Research, 37, 4, pp. 555-569, (2010); Brewer M.B., Gardner W., Who Is This ‘We’?

We have derived our motivation for building such a system design from behavioral finance research. Analyses of the behavior of individual investors provide evidence that this segment does react more significantly to any public news published compared to institutional investors. On the other hand, the analyses show that they react significantly slower than their institutional counterparts. Since empirical intraday event study analyses show that capital markets react promptly to new information and that excess returns decrease over a specific period of time, individual investors miss significant trading opportunities due to their current strategies of information research. We address the problem that this market segment is not able to continuously observe diverse information channels and to assess all the new information available. Our prototype decision support system continuously observes company announcements and forecasts their potential impact on the corresponding stock price. After identifying those events for which significant market reactions can be expected, wireless push-based message services provide the technical basis for prompt and location-independent information supply. Based on a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology we have developed, we demonstrate and quantify the advantages that the developed system provides to the individual investors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

During creating and operating EIEE of educational institution (EI), a number of questions arise related to structural, marketing, personnel and other decisions. The purpose of this article is to research the organizational, technical and didactic aspects of the EIEE EI. The methodology of the research is based on methods of system analysis, cybernetics, pedagogical psychology and didacticism. A conceptual model of the EIEE EI as an organizational and technical system has been proposed. It includes a marketing subsystem, a set of technical tools, various types of security and an organizational subsystem. The main functions of these subsystems and their various components have been identified. A didactic model of a typical complex of digital educational resources has been developed. Within this model, the diversity of digital educational resources across each academic discipline is integrated into complexes that provide a complete study at different target levels of assimilation, from initial acquaintance to solving uncharacteristic professionally oriented tasks. From the point of view of pedagogical psychology and cybernetics, the high importance of feedback in EIEE EI is shown. The classification of feedbacks (internal and external) is proposed for the triad ""Teacher - Teaching Program - Learner"". The limits of the use of automation in the formation of feedbacks are specified, as opposed to other (non-computer) responses to students' educational activities. The role and place of feedback in the ""digital footprints"" of students and teachers is shown and the directions for the use of this data in artificial intelligence systems are outlined. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

By contrast, quantitative simulation produces a unique precise behaviour, but in requiring excessively specific information of the modeller it may produce an inaccurate if precise outcome. © 1995.","Envisionment; Flowgraph; Housing market; Mortgage market; QSim; Qualitative simulation","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Finance; Flowcharting; Housing; Marketing; Envisionment; Flowgraph; Housing market; Mortgage market; Qualitative simulation; Computer simulation","","","","","","","Alba, Villar, Munos, Constraint-based qualitative simulation and its application to diagnosis, (1992); Anand, Introduction to control systems, (1984); Berleant, Kuipers, Qualitative-numeric simulation with Q3, Recent advances in qualitative physics, (1992); Berndsen, Qualitative reasoning and knowledge representation in economic models, PhD thesis, (1992); Bobrow, Qualitative reasoning about physical systems, (1984); Kuipers, Qualitative simulation, Artificial Intelligence, 29, pp. 289-338, (1986); Samuelson, Foundations of economic analysis, (1947); Scott, Leitch, Wyatt, Reducing precision to achieve accurate economic models, Economic and Financial Computing, (1995); Shen, Leitch, Fuzzy qualitative simulation, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 23, 4, pp. 1038-1061, (1991); Weld, de Kleer, Readings in qualitative reasoning about physical systems, (1992)","","","","","","","","","01679236","","DSSYD","","English","Decis Support Syst","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029387219"

With more information about a more diverse set of instruments becoming available to traders, it is becoming important to limit the complexity of the analysis involved. We show how this complexity can be limited by using qualitative analysis, where the objective is to construct a few good vehicles which can then be analyzed quantitatively. We illustrate how two qualitative reasoning techniques - qualitative simulation and qualitative synthesis - are used to design investment vehicles for risk management purposes. These techniques are currently employed by a prototype expert system that aims at assisting traders solving a risk management problem called hedging. © 1995.","(QR); (QSIM); (QSYN); Financial instruments; Financial risk management; Investment decisions; Payoff-profile; Qualitative reasoning; Qualitative reasoning techniques; Qualitative simulation; Qualitative synthesis; Risk management vehicle; Vehicle configuration","Computer simulation; Decision making; Economics; Expert systems; Finance; Marketing; Risk assessment; Vehicles; Financial instruments; Financial risk management; Investment decisions; Payoff-profile; Qualitative reasoning techniques; Qualitative simulation; Qualitative synthesis; Risk management vehicle; Vehicle configuration; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Benaroch, On Building Deep Expert Systems for Wide and Volatile Business Domains, (1992); Benaroch, Dhar, Qualitative Synthesis of System Configurations Based on Desired Behaviour, Proceedings of the 9th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (1992); Benaroch, Dhar, A Knowledge-Based Approach to Solving Hedge Design Problems, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on AI Application on Wall Street, (1991); Bobrow, Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems, (1984); Cox, Rubinstein, Options Markets, (1985); De Kleer, Brown, A Qualitative Physics Based on Confluences, Artificial Intelligence, 24, pp. 7-83, (1984); Elton, Gruber, Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis, (1987); Gentner, Stevens, Mental Models, (1983); Hull, Options, Futures, and Other Derivative Securities, (1993); Kuipers, Berleant, Using Incomplete Quantitative Knowledge in Qualitative Reasoning, Proceedings of AAAI-88, pp. 324-329, (1988); Kuipers, Qualitative Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, 29, pp. 289-338, (1986); Saucedo, Schiring, Introduction to Continuous and Digital Control Systems, (1968); Williams, Interaction-Based Invention: Designing Novel Devices from First Principles, Proceedings of AAAI-87, pp. 349-356, (1987)","","","","","","","","","01679236","","DSSYD","","English","Decis Support Syst","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029387105"

Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings: There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications: The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

The artificial intelligence (AI) information based PIPS was run two ways - selection with biased subjectivity (similar to current best value processes) and without biased subjectivity. Unlike other best value processes, PIPS minimizes the decision-making and subjective bias of the owner's representatives. The procurement test at Bridgerland ATC provides a comparison between the AI selection versus the user agency's subjective prioritization. The result of the system was one of the ""best"" construction projects procured at the state of Utah (on time, on budget, high quality), with no contractor generated change orders for additional cost, minimized construction management requirements, and high customer satisfaction.","Artificial intelligence; Construction; Cost control; Project management; Utah","Artificial intelligence; Contracts; Costs; Decision making; Marketing; Project management; Purchasing; Risk management; Standards; Cost control; Information measurement theory (IMT); Litigation; Utah; Construction industry","","","","","","","Kashiwagi D.T., State of Hawaii selects 'best value' by artificial intelligence, J.

A number of studies have been done over the past few years that try to solve this problem by considering a non-adversarial environment in which there exists only one player with no competitor. However, in real world scenarios, there is always more than one player competing with other players to influence the most nodes. This is called competitive influence maximization. Motivated by this, we try to solve the competitive influence maximization problem by proposing a new propagation model which is an extension of the Linear Threshold model and gives decision-making ability to nodes about incoming influence spread. We also propose an efficient algorithm for finding the influential nodes in a given social graph under the proposed propagation model which exploits the community structure of this graph to compute the spread of each node locally within its own community. The aim of our algorithm is to find the minimum number of seed nodes which can achieve higher spread in comparison with the spread achieved by nodes selected by other competitor. Our experiments on real world and synthetic datasets show that our approach can find influential nodes in an acceptable running time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Community detection; Competitive influence maximization; Influence maximization; Linear threshold model; Social network","Artificial intelligence; Social networking (online); Software engineering; Adversarial environments; Community detection; Community structures; Influence maximizations; Linear threshold models; Propagation modeling; Real-world scenario; Synthetic datasets; Knowledge based systems","","","","","","","Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network, Proceedings of SIGKDD, pp. 137-146, (2003); Leskovec J., Krause A., Guestrin C., Faloutsos C., VanBriesen J., Glance N., Cost-effective outbreak detection in networks, Proceedings of SIGKDD, pp. 420-429, (2007); Yu H., Kim S.-K., Kim J., Scalable and parallelizable processing of influence maximization for large-scale social networks, Proceedings of ICDE, pp. 266-277, (2013); Goyal A., Lu W., Lakshmanan L.V., Simpath: an efficient algorithm for influence maximization under the linear threshold model, Proceedings of ICDM, pp. 211-220, (2011); Chen W., Yuan Y., Zhang L., Scalable influence maximization in social networks under the linear threshold model, Proceedings of ICDM, pp. 88-97, (2010); He X., Song G., Chen W., Jiang Q., Influence blocking maximization in social networks under the competitive linear threshold model, Proceedings of ICDM, pp. 463-474, (2012); Chen W., Collins A., Cummings R., Ke T., Liu Z., Rincon D., Sun X., Wang Y., Wei W., Yuan Y., Influence maximization in social networks when negative opinions may emerge and propagate, Proceedings of ICDM, pp. 379-390, (2011); Lu W., Bonchi F., Goyal A., Lakshmanan L.V., The bang for the buck: fair competitive viral marketing from the host perspective, Proceedings of SIGKDD, pp. 928-936, (2013); Bharathi S., Kempe D., Salek M., Competitive influence maximization in social networks, Internet and Network Economics, pp. 306-311, (2007); Budak C., Agrawal D., El Abbadi A., Limiting the spread of misinformation in social networks, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 665-674, (2011); Liu W., Yue K., Wu H., Li J., Liu D., Tang D., Containment of competitive influence spread in social networks, Knowl.

Since the BVAR model is vulnerable to permanent and temporary shifts in purchasing patterns over time, a form that can correct for the shifts and still provide the other advantages of the BVAR is a Bayesian Vector Error-Correction Model (BVECM). We present the mechanics of extending the DSS to move from a BVAR model to the BVECM model for the category management problem. Several additional iterative steps are required in the DSS to allow the decision maker to arrive at the best forecast possible. The revised marketing DSS framework and model fitting procedures are described.

It could be convergence (simultaneous utilization during the same entrepreneurial processes with the emphasis on unique features by the terms of the competition) or divergence (usage during different business processes by the terms of labor division). Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the influence of usage of human capital and AI on the efficiency of social entrepreneurship. The authors identify the perspective directions of usage of AI in social entrepreneurship and evaluate the readiness and interest in the implementation of these directions of concerned parties. The authors also model the optimal proportions and the variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in the future (until 2030). Findings: It is found that social entrepreneurship will use the opportunities of Industry 4.0 for optimization of its activities until 2030, but will refuse from full automatization, using human intellect and AI at the same time. Originality/value: The most perspective directions of application of AI at social companies are a collection of social goods and services, marketing studies and promotion of social goods and services. Neither convergence nor divergence of human and artificial intellectual capital does not fully conform to the interests of concerned parties.

Marketing decision makers constantly need to monitor changes in the environment and organization to make necessary changes. Therefore, a knowledge management (KM) system is required to acquire, store, retrieve and use up-to-date knowledge. Corporations also tend to look for systems to assist them in knowledge management. Agent technology looks set for assisting organizations in collecting, processing and using knowledge with high accuracy, speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for marketing decision making through using agent technology, fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy AHP is used for allocating the weight of determinant criteria and fuzzy logic is deployed for determining the final decision in pessimistic, moderate and optimistic satiations. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) developing a knowledge management framework for capturing, storing, disseminating and utilizing marketing knowledge by using agent system, and (b) helping marketing decision makers to make effective decisions based on useful knowledge, and (c) encouraging marketing decisions towards the intelligence. Implementation of the proposed system in a car factory indicates that it is efficient and effective in supporting and improving marketing decision making. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Brand-managing activities are typically related to brand positioning and integration with marketing campaigns, and can involve complex decisions. The branding of an organization is indeed a dynamic system with many cause-effect relationships as well as intangible and heterogeneous variables. In order to help brand managers and marketers, we propose a decision support system, named Identimod, for modeling and evaluating branding strategies. Identimod uses non-linear dynamic modeling and soft computing to identify the branding system from different data sources through a linguistic user interface, and to provide advanced methods for diagnostics and validation. Identimod steps through a participatory, cyclic, and iterative process consisting of four different modules to increase the confidence and validity of the model, which should facilitate its acceptance by managers and stakeholders. Throughout this paper we demonstrate the modeling process and managerial benefits of Identimod by forming and answering the marketing questions for a real rebranding case of a seafood company in Spain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Branding; Decision support systems; Marketing; Soft computing","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Iterative methods; Managers; Marketing; Soft computing; User interfaces; Branding; Branding strategies; Cause-effect relationships; Complex decision; Iterative process; Marketing campaign; Modeling process; Non-linear dynamics; Decision support systems","","","","","RØD Brand Consultants; ZIO; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (TIN2015-67661); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work has been supported by RØD Brand Consultants (ZIO research contract) and the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad under NEWSOCO project (ref.

For instance, a treatment that works for the overall population might be highly ineffective, or even harmful, for a subgroup of subjects with specific characteristics. Similarly, a new treatment may not be better than an existing treatment in the overall population, but there is likely a subgroup of subjects who would benefit from it. The notion that ""one size may not fit all"" is becoming increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from economics to medicine. This has drawn significant attention to personalize the choice of treatment, so it is optimal for each individual. An optimal personalized treatment is the one that maximizes the probability of a desirable outcome. We call the task of learning the optimal personalized treatment personalized treatment learning. From the statistical learning perspective, this problem imposes important challenges, primarily because the optimal treatment is unknown on a given training set. A number of statistical methods have been proposed recently to tackle this problem. However, considering the critical importance of these methods to decision support systems, personalized treatment learning models have received relatively little attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method labeled causal conditional inference trees and its natural extension to causal conditional inference forests. The performance of the new method is analyzed and compared to alternative methods for personalized treatment learning. The results show that our new proposed method often outperforms the alternatives on the numerical settings described in this article. We also illustrate an application of the proposed method using data from a large Canadian insurer for the purpose of selecting the best targets for cross-selling an insurance product. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Causal inference; Marketing interventions; Personalized treatment learning","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Economics; Marketing; Numerical methods; Causal inferences; Conditional inference; Decision support framework; Natural extension; Optimal treatment; Personalized marketings; Personalized treatment learning; Statistical learning; Decision support systems","","","","","Ministry of Science; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, ICREA; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (ECO2013-48326-C02-1)","LG thanks Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Insurance.

The idea has successfully been used by marketers to reach a large number of customers rapidly. If data about the customer network is available, centrality measures provide a structural measure that can be used in decision support systems to select influencers and spread viral marketing campaigns in a customer network. Usage stimulation and churn management are examples of DSS applications, where centrality of customers does play a role. The literature on network theory describes a large number of such centrality measures. A critical question is which of these measures is best to select an initial set of customers for a marketing campaign, in order to achieve a maximum dissemination of messages. In this paper, we present the results of computational experiments based on call data from a telecom company to compare different centrality measures for the diffusion of marketing messages.

Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products. With the massive amount of data available from the cloud, which were conventionally made with a high degree of intuition based on decision makers’ knowledge and experience, can now be supported with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach in applying the fuzzy association rule mining approach and the fuzzy logic technique, for discovering the factors influencing the pricing decision of products launched in e-commerce retail site, and in formulating flexible, dynamic pricing strategies for each product launched in an e-commerce site. A pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses, namely Smart-Quo, is developed and implemented in a Hong Kong-based B2B e-commerce retail company. A six-month pilot run reveals a significant improvement in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness in making pricing decisions on each product. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques in marketing management in today’s digital age. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence;

This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules for personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique for personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.","Decision-tree induction; Internet advertising; Internet store-front; Machine learning; Personalization","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Arning A., Bollinger T., Mehta M., Schafer J., Srikant R., The quest data mining system, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining, pp. 244-249, (1996); Allen C., Kania D., Yaeckel B., Internet World Guide to One-to-One Web Marketing, (1998); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G., Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support; Broadvision.

Cultivating online relationships—defined as relational exchanges that are mediated by Internet-based channels—presents firms with challenges and opportunities. In lockstep with exponential advancements in computing technology, a rich and ever-evolving toolbox is available to relationship marketers to manage customer relationships online, in settings including e-commerce, social media, online communities, mobile, big data, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality. To advance academic knowledge and guide managerial decision making, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of online relationship marketing in terms of its conceptual foundations, evolution in business practice, and empirical insights from academic research. The authors propose an evolving theory of online relationship marketing, characterizing online relationships as uniquely seamless, networked, omnichannel, personalized, and anthropomorphized. Based on these five essential features, six tenets and 11 corresponding propositions parsimoniously predict the performance effects of the manifold online relationship marketing strategies. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.","E-commerce; Mobile shopping; Online relationships; Online retailing; Online shopping; Relationship marketing; Relationship selling; Social media; Virtual assistants","","","","","","","","Custom Home Workouts App, Healthy Meal and Nutrition Plans, (2018); Developers to invest $2.5 billion in augmented reality in 2018; look for enterprise to drive smart glasses, (2013); Achen R.M., The influence of Facebook engagement on relationship quality and consumer behavior in the National Basketball Association, Journal of Relationship Marketing, 15, 4, pp. 247-268, (2016); Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Aguirre E., Mahr D., Grewal D., de Ruyter K., Wetzel M., Unraveling the personalization paradox: the effect of information collection and trust-building strategies on online advertisement effectiveness, Journal of Retailing, 91, 1, pp. 34-49, (2015); Andrews M., Luo X., Fang Z., Ghose A., Mobile ad effectiveness: hyper-contextual targeting with crowdedness, Marketing Science, 35, 2, pp. 218-233, (2016); Ansari A., Mela C.F., Neslin S.A., Customer channel migration, Journal of Marketing Research, 45, 1, pp. 60-76, (2008); Arli D., Bauer C., Palmatier R.W., Relational selling: past, present and future, Industrial Marketing Management, 69, pp. 169-184, (2018); Armerding T., The 17 Biggest Data Breaches of the 21St Century – Security Practitioners Weigh in on the 17 Worst Data Breaches in Recent Memory, (2018); Arora N., Dreze X., Ghose A., Hess J.D., Iyengar R., Jing B., Joshi Y., Kumar V., Lurie N., Neslin S., Sajeesh S., Su M., Syam N., Thomas J., Zhang Z.J., Putting one-to-one marketing to work: personalization, customization, and choice, Marketing Letters, 19, 3-4, pp. 305-321, (2008); Ascarza E., Ebbes P., Netzer O., Danielson M., Beyond the target customer: social effects of customer relationship management campaigns, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 3, pp. 347-363, (2017); Babic Rosario A., Sotgiu F., De Valck K., Bijmolt T.H.A., The effect of electronic word of mouth on sales: a meta-analytic review of platform, product, and metric factors, Journal of Marketing Research, 53, 3, pp. 229-297, (2016); Ballantine P.W., Martin B.A.S., Forming parasocial relationships in online communities, Advances in consumer research, 32, pp. 197-201, (2005); Banovic J., How Nike Use Social Media [Case Study], (2017); Barnes N.G., Griswold J., Use of popular tools remains constant as use of Instagram expands quickly among the 2016 Fortune 500, (2016); Bart Y., Shankar V., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

Pre-printed inserts allow advertisers to deliver colorful, high-quality marketing material to targeted groups of consumers within the newspaper's delivery zone structure. To accommodate the increased workload associated with pre-printed inserts without negatively impacting the news deadline or delivery schedules, many newspaper companies face increasingly complex post-press scheduling decisions. This paper presents a spreadsheet model developed to represent the pre-printed insert scheduling problem in a case study of an actual medium-size newspaper company. The performance of two commercial genetic algorithm (GA) optimizers is compared on this problem. Computational testing shows the GAs develop schedules that substantially reduce the post-press production department's insert processing time. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer information; Customer lifetime value;

The main body of this research is characterised by the proposal of a brand new and complete methodology for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), to be applied in marketing causal modelling and with utilities to be used as a marketing management decision support tool. Such methodology is based on Genetic Fuzzy Systems, a specific hybridization of artificial intelligence methods, highly suited to the research problem we face. The use of KDD methodologies based on intelligent systems like this can be considered as an avant-garde evolution, exponent nowadays of the so-called knowledge-based Marketing Management Support Systems; we name them as Marketing Intelligent Systems. The most important questions to the KDD process-i.e. pre-processing; machine learning and post-processing-are discussed in depth and solved. After its theoretical presentation, we empirically experiment with it, using a consumer behaviour model of reference. In this part of the paper, we try to offer an overall perspective of how it works. The valuation of its performance and utility is very positive. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Nowadays, most companies have their own websites to promote their company products and services aiming at developing their business. To recognise macromarketing trends and real-time customers’ needs, contents in customer websites are valuable asset. However, different semantic patterns used in various parties may have great challenges in the comprehension of the content in the website. Moreover, organisational sales transaction system such as Management Information System (MIS) can help to determine sales performance of well-known customers. However, the customer information can only be part of the marketing information. As a result, this paper presents a Web Semantic Network Analysis (WSNA) approach for business intelligence. A prototype of an agent-based web Business Intelligence System (BIS) is established based on the WSNA approach. By adopting and integrating semantic network, agent technology, rule-based decision support system and scoring technique, the marking and sale performance information can be captured, clustered, compared, analysed, integrated and disseminated. This leverages organisational marketing capital to support marketing plan and shorten the promotion planning time. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","agent technology; artificial intelligence; business intelligence; knowledge management; semantic network","","","","","","","","Angus Electronics Company Limited, (1990); Buchner A., Mulvenna M.D., Discovering internet marketing intelligence through online analytical web usage mining, ACM SIGMOD Record, 27, 4, pp. 54-61, (1999); Business Intelligence Lowdown, What is business intelligence?, (2006); Chakrabarti S., Dom B., Agrawal R., Raghavan P., Scalable feature selection, classification and signature generation for organizing large text databases into hierarchical topic taxonomies, The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases, 7, 3, pp. 163-178, (1998); Chen H., Chung Y.-M., Ramsey M., Intelligent spider for internet searching, Thirtieth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) Volume 4: Information Systems Track – Internet and the Digital Economy, (1997); Princeton WordNet, (2005); Cooley R., Mobasher B., Srivastava J., Data preparation for mining world wide web browsing patterns, Knowledge and Information Systems, 1, 1, (1999); Farhoomand A.F., Scientific progress of management information systems, Database, 18, 4, pp. 48-56, (1987); Hayes-Roth B., An architecture for adaptive intelligent systems, Artificial Intelligence: Special Issue on Agents and Interactivity, 72, 1-2, pp. 10-18, (1995); Hong Kong Trade Development Council, (2000); Jaideep S., Robert C., Mukund D., Pang-Ning T., Web usage mining: discovery and applications of usage patterns from web data, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 1, 2, (2000); Internet Systems Consortium, Internet Domain Survey, (2006); ISO 2788, Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri, (1986); Koster M., Robots in the web: threat or treat?, ConneXions, 9, 4, (1995); McCluskey N., Untangling web content management – intranet, extranet and otherwise, (2000); Pham T.T., Chen G., Some applications of fuzzy logic in rule-based expert systems, Expert Systems, 19, 4, pp. 208-223, (2002); Pirolli P., Pitkow J., Rao R., Silk from a sow’s ear: extracting usable structures from the web, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Common Ground, pp. 118-125, (1996); Soper D.S., A framework for automated web business intelligence systems, Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'05) – Track 8, 8, (2005); Sowa J.F., Semantic networks, (2006); Tradelink Electronic Commerce Limited, (2006); Windows History: Internet Explorer History, (2003); Ya-Jun D., Yang X., Zhan-Shen L., Dong-Mei Q., Discussion on interest spider’s algorithm of search engine, Information Reuse and Integration 2004, Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference, pp. 588-593, (2004)","","","","","","","","","17481252","","","","English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research based on exploratory in-depth interviews with industry experts currently working with artificial intelligence tools. Findings: Key themes include: (1) Importance of AI in strategic marketing decision management; (2) Presence of AI in strategic decision management; (3) Role of AI in strategic decision management; (4) Importance of business culture for the use of AI; (5) Impact of AI on the business’ organizational model. A key consideration is a “creative-possibility perspective,” highlighting the future potential to use AI not only for rational but also for creative thinking purposes. Research limitations/implications: This work is focused only on strategy creation as a deliberate process. For this, AI can be used as an effective response to the external contingencies of high volumes of data and uncertain environmental conditions, as well as being an effective response to the external contingencies of limited managerial cognition. A key future consideration is a “creative-possibility perspective.” Practical implications: A practical extension of the Gartner Analytics Ascendancy Model (Maoz, 2013). Originality/value: This paper aims to contribute knowledge relating to the role of AI in marketing strategy formulation and explores the potential avenues for future use of AI in the strategic marketing process. This is explored through the lens of contingency theory, and additionally, findings are expressed using the Gartner analytics ascendancy model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Creativity; Marketing strategy; Rationality; TQM/Marketing synergy","Commerce; Marketing; Strategic planning; Artificial intelligence tools; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental conditions; In-depth interviews; Managerial cognitions; Organizational modeling; Qualitative research; Strategic marketing; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Italian government","It is important to understand how AI enables different types of knowledge to appropriately select and use the potential of AI to manage knowledge (). With this work, the authors hope to add knowledge and research opportunities relating to the use of AI for strategy creation. The results provide evidence that AI can augment, replace, or complement the human decision-making process () for marketing strategy creation. It especially serves to further highlight the potential of a complementary relationship between managers and machines (). The research has provided empirical evidence that AI can be a tool for marketing strategy creation. One area emerging from the interviews is what the article suggests to call a creative-possibility perspective. The authors hope this creative-possibility perspective provides an avenue to further study how managers can partner with AI in strategy formulation activities. Further, the expert interviews highlight the opportunity from a business school curriculum perspective. They identified how many organizations are not yet ready for the change AI entails. The main factor to help in facilitating change is the creation of a link between universities and industry. For example, in Italy, this has commenced through a series of projects funded by the Italian government, and the creation of eight competence centers. Evidence provided regarding AI can be a tool for marketing strategy creation and may form input to future business school initiatives and partnerships.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the attributes usually referred to the characteristics of wheat flour known to consumers and at implementing a predictive model of purchasing that allows to make correct decisions without the necessary experience of a real human expert. Design/methodology/approach: In order to investigate the research aims of the paper, an online survey was carried out and conducted by means of the Google Forms in the detection time January-April 2016. The online survey collected responses from 467 Italian respondents asked to give feedback about their buying habits of various types of flour. The responses were analyzed through a data mining approach. This paper implements predictive analytics to create a statistical model of future behavior by means of a machine learning algorithms. Findings: In line with recent healthy and dynamic trends in the food industry, conscious consumer seems to be willing to pay a price for “type 1” wheat flour that is four times higher than the price related to the basic types of wheat flour. Social implications: Consumer seems not to know well the “type 1” wheat flour and its healthy characteristics; then, it should be crucial to implement promotional strategies and marketing hand in hand. Promotion can be a key element in putting across the health benefits of special kinds of wheat flour. Originality/value: Highlighting health issues about the “type 1” wheat flour gives insights and sheds some light on the crucial need of changing eating and purchasing behavior. Then, originality of this paper can be found in the used predictive algorithm of the artificial intelligence. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Basis types of wheat flour; Consumer behaviour; Healthy food; Machine learning algorithms","artificial intelligence; consumer attitude; data mining; eating; female; food industry; habit; human; major clinical study; male; marketing; purchasing; wheat flour","","","","","","","Akhtar S., Ashgar A., Mineral fortification of whole wheat flour: an overview, Flour and Breads and their Fortification in Health and Disease Prevention, 7, 6, pp. 263-271, (2011); Almeida-Alvarado S.L., Aguilar-Lopez T., Hervert-Hernandez D., Fiber and health benefits, Anales Venezolanos De Nutricion, 27, 1, pp. 73-76, (2014); Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2014); Annett L.E., Muralidharan V., Boxall P.C., Cash S.B., Wismer W.V., Influence of health and environmental information on hedonic evaluation of organic and conventional bread, Journal of Food Science, 73, 4, pp. H50-H57, (2008); Antonazzo A.P., Fiore M., La Sala P., Conto F., Assessing perceptions of wine tourists on organic wine, Rivista Economia AgroAlimentare, 17, 2, pp. 57-76, (2014); Azais-Braesco V., Brighenti F., Paoletti R., Peracino A., Scarborough P., Visioli F., Vogele C., Healthy food and healthy choices: a new European profile approach, Atherosclerosis Supplements, 10, pp. 1-11, (2009); Barreiro-Hurle J., Gracia A., de-Magistris T., The effects of multiple health and nutrition labels on consumer food choices, Journal of Agricultural Economics, 61, 2, pp. 426-443, (2010); Birkett A.M., Cho S.S., Cereal fiber and health: current knowledge, Cereal Foods World, 58, 6, pp. 309-313, (2013); Birol E., Karousakis K., Koundouri P., Using a choice experiment to account for preference heterogeneity in wetland attributes: the case of Cheimaditida wetland in Greece, Ecological Economics, 60, 1, pp. 145-156, (2006); Bitzios M., Fraser I., Haddock-Fraser J., Functional ingredients and food choice: results from a dual-mode study employing means-end-chain analysis and a choice experiment, Food Policy, 36, 5, pp. 715-725, (2011); Boeing H., Bechthold A., Bub A., Ellinger S., Haller D., Kroke A., Leschik-Bonnet E., Muller M.J., Oberritter H., Schulze M., Stehle P., Watzl B., Critical review: vegetables and fruit in the prevention of chronic diseases, European Journal of Nutrition, 51, 6, pp. 637-663, (2012); Bravo L., Polyphenols: chemistry, dietary sources, metabolism, and nutritional significance, Nutrition Reviews, 56, 11, pp. 317-333, (1998); Brewer M.S., Reducing the fat content in ground beef without sacrificing quality: a review, Meat Science, 91, 4, pp. 385-395, (2012); Butriss J.L., Are health claims and functional foods a route to improving the nation’s health?, Nutrition Bulletin, 35, 2, pp. 87-91, (2010); Conover W.J., Practical Nonparametric Statistics, (1980); De Koning L., Hu F.B., Do the health benefits of dietary fiber extend beyond cardiovascular disease?, Archives of Internal Medicine, 171, 12, pp. 1069-1070, (2011); Dewettinck K., Van Bockstaele K.B., Van de Walle D., Courtens T.M., Gellynck X., Nutritional value of bread: influence of processing, food interaction and consumer perception, Journal of Cereal Science, 48, 2, pp. 243-257, (2016); Dziuban C.D., Shirkey E.C., When is a correlation matrix appropriate for factor analysis?

Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method with several other classifiers used in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the ROC curve and geometric mean. © 2016","Ensemble;

Since the arrival of the Web 2.0, more and more textual documents containing information that express opinions or comments in different languages are available. Given the proven importance of such documents, the use of effective multilingual opinion mining systems has become of high importance to different fields. This paper presents the experiments carried out with the objective to develop a multilingual sentiment analysis system. We present initial evaluations of methods and resources performed in two international evaluation campaigns for English and for Spanish. After our participation in both competitions, additional experiments were carried out with the aim of improving the performance of both Spanish and English systems by using multilingual machine-translated data. Based on our evaluations, we show that the use of hybrid features and multilingual, machine-translated data (even from other languages) can help to better distinguish relevant features for sentiment classification and thus increase the precision of sentiment analysis systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners’ marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers’ decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Prediction; Restaurant reviews; Review helpfulness","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., Online review helpfulness: role of qualitative factors, Psychology and Marketing, 33, 11, pp. 1006-1017, (2016); Ahani A., Nilashi M., Ibrahim O., Sanzogni L., Weaven S., Market segmentation and travel choice prediction in spa hotels through TripAdvisor’s online reviews, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 80, pp. 52-77, (2019); Antonio N., de Almeida A.M., Nunes L., Batista F., Ribeiro R., Hotel online reviews: creating a multi-source aggregated index, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 12, pp. 3574-3591, (2018); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Banerjee S., Bhattacharyya S., Bose I., Whose online reviews to trust?

As a consequence, their mode of operation has become more complex and demands better production planning and control (PPC). One solution is to use an information system in which all factory resources are integrated within a single framework for PPC. The main instrument of this strategy is an Organizational DSS (ODSS). This paper presents a case study of development and adoption of an ODSS in a small manufacturing enterprise. Analysis of the findings highlights the cultural as well as organizational underpinnings and the need for effective intervention before and throughout the computerization. The implementation strategies are described, with emphasis on prerequisite infrastructural developments, showing how they provide opportunities and constraints. © 1994.","Case study; Industrial collaboration; Information systems development; Organizational decision support system (ODSS); Production planning and control (PPC); Small manufacturing enterprise; Technology adoption; Technology transfer","Industrial applications; Production control; Technology transfer; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Distribution functions; Manufacture; Photolithography; Planning; Production engineering; Project management; Technological forecasting; Case study; Industrial collaboration; Information systems development; Organizational decision support system (ODSS); Production planning and control (PPC); Small manufacturing enterprise; Technology adoption; Information systems development; Organizational decision support systems; Production planning/control; Small manufacturing enterprise; Decision support systems; Information systems","","","","","","","Alter, Decision Support Systems: Current Practices and Continuing Challenge, (1980); Baudin, Manufacturing Systems Analysis, (1990); Benbasat, Goldstein, Mead, The Case Research Strategy in Studies of Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, 11, 3, pp. 368-386, (1987); Carter, Murray, Walker, Walker, Building Organizational Decision Support Systems, (1992); Chung, Tam, Empirical-based Manufacturing Research Paradigm, Proc.

In response to this problem, alternate pricing strategies are proposed in this paper that make use of market-based approaches. These models are centered on marketing intelligence functions. In this paper, marketing intelligence systems developed and used in manufacturing industries are explored, including marketing research, marketing information systems, and decision support systems. The current developments and practices of marketing intelligence in construction are reviewed. The findings of a survey that investigates the marketing intelligence and pricing strategy practices of the largest 400 U.S. contractors are presented. In conclusion, it is discovered that contractors use mostly traditional marketing intelligence strategies. It is recommended that contractors develop computerized intelligence activities such as using resources on the Internet and developing management information systems and decision support systems. As expected, it is found that ""marketing intelligence capabilities"" is a significant variable associated with pricing strategy.","","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Engineering research; Information management; Internet; Marketing; Public policy; Strategic planning; Market research; Marketing intelligence; Pricing policy; Pricing strategy; Construction industry","","","","","","","Ahmad I., Decision-support system for modeling bid/no-bid decision problem, J.

In this domain, the ability to introduce distinct cognitive agents which cooperate to solve the problem enables the processing of more complex and ill-structured problems. This paper presents a general framework for building a distributed strategic decision support system (DSDSS) which integrates both advances in distributed decision making and distributed artificial intelligence. It goes on to describe a cooperative and distributed system with two specific features: the users intervene as human agents in the solution formation, and strategic knowledge and domain knowledge are distributed in different agents which communicate through various blackboards and message passing. An example is provided in the field of strategic marketing which illustrates how the system operates. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Blackboard systems; Distributed artificial intelligence;

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Many regulatory and ethical issues should be considered. Some relevant EU provisions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, are applicable. However, the regulatory framework for developing and marketing a new health technology implementing ML may be quite complex. Other issues include the legal liability and the attribution of negligence in case of errors. Some of the above-mentioned concerns could be, at least partially, resolved in case the ML software is classified as a 'medical device', a category covered by EU/national provisions. Concluding, the challenge is to understand how sustainable is the regulatory system in relation to the ML innovation and how legal procedures should be revised in order to adapt them to the current regulatory framework. © 2020 Copyright 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","artificial intelligence;

This information, in turn, can be used for marketing purposes to acquire new clients or sell products to existing clients. A Decision Support System (DSS) can help a manager to decide the sequence of clients to contact to reach a designed target. In this paper we present the BIG CHASE, a DSS that translates bank data into a reliability graph. This graph models relationships based on a probability of traversal function that includes social measures. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with Banco Santander, S.A., fits the parameters of the probability function to explicit solution evaluations given by experts by means of a specifically designed Projected Gradient Descent algorithm. The fitted probability function determines the reliabilities associated to the edges of the graph. An optimization procedure tailored to be efficient on very large sparse graphs with millions of nodes and edges identifies the most reliable sequence of clients that a manager should contact to reach a specific target. The BIG CHASE has been tested with a case study on real data that includes Banco Santander, S.A. 2015 Spain bank records. Experimental results show that the proposed DSS is capable of modeling the experts' evaluations into probability function with a small error. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Client acquisition; Financial networks; Maximum reliability path; Projected gradient descent; Social modelling","Artificial intelligence; Function evaluation; Graph theory; Managers; Probability; Reliability; Client acquisition; Decision support system (dss); Financial networks; Maximum reliability; Optimization procedures; Probability functions; Projected gradient; Traversal functions; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Barsade S.G., The ripple effect: emotional contagion and its influence on group behavior, Adm.

Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY 10012, 44 West Fourth Street, United States","It can be expensive to acquire the data required for businesses to employ data-driven predictive modeling - for example, to model consumer preferences to optimize targeting. Prior research has introduced ""active-learning"" policies for identifying data that are particularly useful for model induction, with the goal of decreasing the statistical error for a given acquisition cost (error-centric approaches). However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly. We also show that this method is robust in the face of decreasing quality of utility estimations, eventually converging to uniform random sampling, and that it can be extended to situations where different data acquisitions have different costs. The results suggest that businesses should consider modifying their strategies for acquiring information through normal business transactions. For example, a firm such as Amazon.com that models consumer preferences for customized marketing may accelerate learning by proactively offering recommendations - not merely to induce immediate sales, but for improving recommendations in the future. © 2007 INFORMS.","Active learning; Classifier induction; Decision making; Decision-support systems; Predictive modeling","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Errors; Marketing; Acquisition costs; Active Learning; Business transaction; Consumer preferences; Decision making process; Predictive modeling; Predictive models; Statistical errors; Decision making","","","","","","","Baram Y., El Yaniv R., Luz K., Online choice of active learning algorithms, J.

The Electronic Revolution has also spawned a trend of price wars and, in some instances, chaos, because of the zero-sum nature of the electronic channel. The technology has created an opportunity to get beyond the lose-lose nature of single issue price wars by determining sellers' and buyers' preferences across multiple issues and encouraging negotiations, thereby creating possible joint gains for all parties. We develop simple multiple-issue algorithms and heuristics that could be used in electronic auctions and electronic markets, to match businesses to businesses and consumers based on dovetailing underlying interests and preferences. We provide arguments that such dovetailed matches should help stabilize markets and make them more efficient.","","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Heuristic methods; Information technology;

In addition, customer profitability accounting (CPA) recommends evaluating the CRM program through the combination of partial measures in a global costĝ€""benefit function. Several statistical techniques have been applied for market segmentations although the existence of large data sets reduces their effectiveness. As an alternative, decision trees are machine learning models that do not consider a priori hypotheses, achieve a high performance, and generate logical rules clearly understood by managers. In this article, a three-stage methodology is proposed that combines marketing feature selection, customer segmentation through univariate and oblique decision trees, and a new CPA function based on marketing, data warehousing, and opportunity costs linked to the analysis of different scenarios. This proposal is applied to a large insurance marketing data set for alternative cost and price conditions showing the superiority of univariate decision trees over statistical techniques. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Artificial intelligence; Costĝ€""benefit analysis; Customer profitability accounting; Customer relationship management; Marketing","","","","","","","","Anderberg M.R., Cluster Analysis for Applications, (1973); Bass F.M., Tigert D.G., Lonsdale R.T., Market segmentation: Group versus individual behaviour, Journal of Marketing Research, 5, pp. 264-270, (1968); Berger P.D., Nasr N., Customer lifetime value: Marketing models and applications, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 12, pp. 17-30, (1998); Blum A., Langley P., Selection of relevant features and examples in machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, 97, pp. 245-271, (1997); Bouwens J., Abernethy M.A., The consequences of customisation on management accounting system design, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 25, pp. 221-241, (2000); Breiman L., Friedman J.H., Olshen R.A., Stone C.J., Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Brijs T., Retail Market Basket Analysis: A Quantitative Modelling Approach, (2002); Cooper R., Kaplan R.S., Measure cost right: Make the right decision, Harvard Business Review, pp. 96-103, (1988); Davila T., An empirical study on drivers of management control systems' design in new product development, Accounting, Organization and Society, 25, pp. 383-409, (2002); Dibb S., Stern P., Questioning the reliability of market segmentation techniques, Omega, 23, pp. 625-636, (1995); Doyle P., Saunders J., Market segmentation and positioning in specialized industrial markets, Journal of Marketing, 49, pp. 24-32, (1985); Foster G., Gupta M., Marketing, cost management and management accounting, Journal of Management Accounting Research, 6, pp. 43-77, (1994); Gath I., Geva A.B., Unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 11, 7, pp. 773-781, (1988); Gerdin J., Greve J., Forms of contingency fit in management accounting research: A critical review, Accounting, Organization and Society, 29, pp. 303-326, (2004); Green P.E., Wind Y., New ways to measure consumers' judgements, Harvard Business Review, 53, pp. 107-117, (1975); Green P.E., A new approach to market segmentation, Business Horizons, 20, pp. 61-73, (1977); Guilding C., McManus L., The incidence, perceived merit and antecedents of customer accounting: An exploratory note, Accounting, Organization and Society, 27, pp. 45-59, (2002); He Z., Xu X., Huang J.Z., Deng S., Mining class outliers: Concepts, algorithms and applications in CRM, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, pp. 681-697, (2004); Heath D., Kasif S., Salzberg S., August-September).

Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm’s offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term. Complexity academic level: This case could work well as part of an executive education course, as well as a strategic management course for master’s degree or Master of Business Administration students.

With the large array of service offerings, telecom providers engage in active advertising of service bundles to attract new as well as retain the existing customers. Focused advertising by personalising the service bundles based on individual customer preferences is a key success factor of such campaigns. This paper proposes the application of a neural network-based decision support model for pattern association using which mixed bundles of such services may be identified, as per customer preferences, so as to induce higher conversion in cross-sales and up-sales. Consumer service preferences can be combined with some standard packages of VAS bundles to personalise the service bundles and these service bundles would be generated dynamically. Identifying and promoting such services identified through pattern association rules will have a direct impact on the overall profitability of the service provider.

However, appropriate learning algorithms, evaluation criteria, and validation procedures are necessary for effective implementation of neural networks to provide decision support to managers. This study compares the performance of Bayesian neural networks with that of logistic regression and the backpropagation method in modelling consumer responses. The results of a ten-fold stratified cross-validation suggest that although the three methods perform equally well under the error rate, Bayesian neural networks generate higher statistics for the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and cumulative lifts. The findings suggest that researchers should adopt effective learning algorithms, relevant evaluation criteria and appropriate validation procedures for neural networks to model consumer responses and solve marketing problems facing today's businesses.","","","","","","","","","Adams N.M., Hand D.J., Improving the practice of classifier performance assessment, Neural Computation, 12, pp. 305-311, (2000);

Design/methodology/approach - The system makes use of data collected from the franchising business and external environment analysis for decision making in center positioning problems. The fuzzy logic approach is integrated into the system for analyzing the geographical market dynamics including profitability and competitiveness in the district concerned. To demonstrate the application of the proposed FDSS, a case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based franchising private education center, i.e. Dr I-Kids Education Center. Findings - The tailor made FDSS helps to facilitate the business operations of the franchising education center and develops a district positioning model for the centers located in the 18 districts of Hong Kong. The findings provide a solid foundation for marketing strategy and expansion direction formulation. Originality/value - Due to the globalization of business, managing a growing franchising business model becomes challenging to the franchisor. In order to fully leverage the merits of the franchising system, an intelligent decision support model, focusing on making strategic development plans, is needed so as to expand the scale of business efficiently. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Decision support; Franchising model; Fuzzy logic","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer circuits; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Marketing; Planning; Decision supports; Design/methodology/approach; Development planning; External environments; Fuzzy logic approach; Intelligent decision support; Strategic development; Strategy formulations; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Aliouche E.H., Schlentrich U.A., Towards a strategic model of global franchise expansion, Journal of Retailing, 87, 3, pp. 345-365, (2011); Altinay L., Okumus F., Franchise partner selection decision making, The Service Industries Journal, 31, 6, pp. 929-946, (2010); Anagnostopoulos K., Doukas H., Psarras J., A linguistic multicriteria analysis system combining fuzzy sets theory, ideal and anti-ideal points for location site selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 35, 4, pp. 2041-2048, (2008); Arnott D., Pervan G., Eight key issues for the decision support systems discipline, Decision Support Systems, 44, 3, pp. 657-672, (2008); Azaron A., Brown K.N., Tarim S.A., Modarres M., A multi-objective stochastic programming approach for supply chain design considering risk, International Journal of Production Economics, 116, 1, pp. 129-138, (2008); Barthelemy J., Opportunism, knowledge, and the performance of franchise chains, Strategic Management Journal, 29, 13, pp. 1451-1463, (2008); Batanovic V., Petrovic D., Petrovic R., Fuzzy logic based algorithms for maximum covering location problems, Information Sciences, 179, 1-2, pp. 120-129, (2009); Bordonaba-Juste V., Polo-Redondo Y., The effect of relationship marketing strategy on franchise channels: Evidence from spanish franchisees, Journal of Marketing Channels, 15, 1, pp. 71-91, (2008); Bordonaba-Juste V., Lucia-Palacios L., Polo-Redondo Y., Influence of franchisors' competitive strategies on network size: The impact of entry timing decision, Journal of Marketing Channels, 17, 1, pp. 33-49, (2010); Bordonaba-Juste V., Lucia-Palacios L., Polo-Redondo Y., An analysis of franchisor failure risk: Evidence from Spain, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 26, 6, pp. 407-420, (2011); Cadez S., Guilding C., Strategy, strategic management accounting and performance: A configurational analysis, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 112, 3, pp. 484-501, (2012); Chou D.C., Lin B., Development of web-based knowledge management systems, Human Systems Management, 21, 3, pp. 153-158, (2002); Cochet O., Garg V.K., How do franchise contracts evolve?

Design/methodology/approach - Two scenario processes were conducted for the study. A heuristic, semi-structured approach, including the use of preliminary questionnaires as well as manual and computerised group support systems (GSS), was applied in the scenario processes. Findings - The scenarios estimated that the biomass market will develop and grow rapidly as well as diversify in the future. The scenario analysis shows the key issues in the field: global economic growth including the growing need for energy, environmental forces in the global evolution, the potential of technological development in solving the global problems, capabilities of the international community to find solutions for the global issues, and the complex interdependencies of all these driving forces. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed involving analysis of the probabilities of the technological and commercial elements in each scenario. It is also important to conceptualise the scale and directions of biomass trade streams and determine the influences of the scenarios from the viewpoints of different actors. Practical implications - The results of the scenario processes provide a starting point for further research analysing the technological and commercial aspects of the scenarios and foreseeing the scales and directions of biomass streams. Originality/value - In this study, scenario processes supplemented by a GSS are applied for investigating the future development of the biomass market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Energy management;

However, the difficulty to obtain timely and accurate demand data from the point-of-sales (POS) calls for alternative solutions to be developed. This paper presents a solution that is based on readily available sell-through data from channel partners, such as distributors, to monitor what happens on the market in product introduction situations. The difficulty with using demand information from distributors rather than the POS is the bullwhip effect that distorts demand as you move upstream in the supply chain. The paper presents how this problem can be overcome by using market mix views of product categories and simple smoothing techniques. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Control applications; Demand; Product launch","Artificial intelligence; Data acquisition; Decision making; Inventory control; Marketing; Product development; Retail stores; Sales; Strategic planning; Control applications; Demand; Product launch; Vendor managed inventopry (VMI); Point of sale terminals","","","","","","","Disney S.M., Towill D.R., A discrete transfer function model to determine the dynamic stability of vendor-managed inventory supply chains, International Journal of Production Research, 40, 1, pp. 179-204, (2002); Framling K., Holmstrom J., A distributed software for collaborative sales forecasting, (2000); Fransoo J., Wouters M., Measuring the bullwhip effect in the supply chain, Supply Chain Management, 5, 2, pp. 78-89, (2000); Holmstrom J., Handling product mix complexity: a case study on re-engineering demand forecasting, Business Process Management Journal, 4, 3, pp. 241-258, (1998); Kaipia R., Holmstrom J., Tanskanen K., What are you losing if you let your customer place orders?, Production Planning & Control, 13, 1, (2002); Lee H., Padmanabhan V., Whang S., The bullwhip effect in supply chains, Sloan Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 93-102, (1997); Nobuhiko T., Forecasting dynamic market share relationships, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 18, 2, pp. 67-77, (2000)","","","","","","","","","13598546","","","","English","Supply Chain Manage.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-9444263137"

It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings: Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers’ decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications: In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model. Originality/value: The change in consumer behavior leads to a change in the service marketing approach needed in the world of AI. The bot, the new service platform is now in charge of search and choice for many purchase situations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial Intelligence; Big data; Bots; Consumer decision-making; Customer experience; Customer service; Robotics; Service experience; Service platforms; Service strategy; Services marketing","","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J.C., Curley S.P., Zhang J., Do recommender systems manipulate consumer preferences?

Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior. To reach the main goal we perform a data analysis of the online sales data by using machine learning methods as clustering, decision tree and association rules mining. After evaluating the proposed model, we discuss its use of the proposed model in the field of internet sales in the agricultural sector.; JEL Classification: C53, D11, D91, M21, M31 © 2020","association rules; Classification; consumer behavior; data analysis; online shopping","artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; data set; electronic commerce; machine learning; marketing","","","","","Grant Agency for Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport","Intelligence within Network Economy” (Contract No. 1/0201/19) funded by Grant Agency for Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.","Adamov Abzetdin Z., Mining Term Association Rules from Unstructured Text in Azerbaijani Language, 2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT), pp. 1-4, (2018); Alfian G., Ijaz M.

Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Whereas the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human–machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human–computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey. The article finishes with implications for policy makers and a future research agenda for researchers examining autonomous technologies. © 2019 The Authors","Adoption barrier; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous technology; Shopping behavior; Smart product; Task delegation","","","","","","","","Aggarwal P., Mazumdar T., Decision Delegation: A Conceptualization and Empirical Investigation, Psychology & Marketing, 25, 1, pp. 71-93, (2008); Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The Social Influence of Brand Community: Evidence from European Car Clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Allen K.A., Ryan T., Gray D.L.L., McInerney D.M., Waters L., Social Media Use and Social Connectedness in Adolescents: The Positives and the Potential Pitfalls, The Educational and Developmental Psychologist, 31, 1, pp. 18-31, (2014); Andre Q., Carmon Z., Wertenbroch K., Crum A., Frank D., Goldstein W., Huber J., Van Boven L., Weber B., Yang H., Consumer Choice and Autonomy in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, 1-2, pp. 28-37, (2018); Antioco M., Kleijnen M., Consumer Adoption of Technological Innovations: Effects of Psychological and Functional Barriers in a Lack of Content versus a Presence of Content Situation, European Journal of Marketing, 44, 11-12, pp. 1700-1724, (2010); Arts J.W.C., Frambach R.T., Bijmolt T.H.A., Generalizations on Consumer Innovation Adoption: A Meta-Analysis on Drivers of Intention and Behavior, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 28, 2, pp. 134-144, (2011); Atasoy O., Morewedge C.K., Digital Goods are Valued Less Than Physical Goods, Journal of Consumer Research, 44, 6, pp. 1343-1357, (2018); Baird N., Robots, Automation and Retail: Not so Cut and Dried, (2018); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Aaker J.L., Garbinsky E.N., Some Key Differences Between a Happy Life and a Meaningful Life, The Journal of Positive Psychology, 8, 6, pp. 505-516, (2013); Beer J.M., Fisk A.D., Rogers W.A., Toward a Framework for Levels of Robot Autonomy in Human–Robot Interaction, Journal of Human–Robot Interaction, 3, 2, pp. 74-99, (2014); Belk R., Machines and Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Marketing Behavior, 4, 1, pp. 11-30, (2019); Berry L.L., Seiders K., Grewal D., Understanding Service Convenience, Journal of Marketing, 66, 3, pp. 1-17, (2002); Botti S., Iyengar S.S., The Psychological Pleasure and Pain of Choosing: When People Prefer Choosing at the Cost of Subsequent Outcome Satisfaction, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 3, pp. 312-326, (2004); Botti S., Iyengar S.S., The Dark Side of Choice: When Choice Impairs Social Welfare, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 25, 1, pp. 24-38, (2006); Bradlow E.T., Gangwar M., Kopalle P., Voleti S., The Role of Big Data and Predictive Analytics in Retailing, Journal of Retailing, 93, 1, pp. 79-95, (2017); Broniarczyk S.M., Griffin J.G., Decision Difficulty in the Age of Consumer Empowerment, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 608-625, (2014); Castelo N., Lehmann D.R., Be Careful What You Wish For: Unintended Consequences of Increasing Reliance on Technology, Journal of Marketing Behavior, 4, 1, pp. 31-42, (2019); Cefkin M., Human–Machine Interactions and the Coming Age of Autonomy, (2016); Cheng Y., Mukhopadhyay A., Schrift R.Y., Do Costly Options Lead to Better Outcomes?

The special procedures of control and management of knowledge therefore have to be used. In the area of knowledge management and knowledge engineering basic terms of these disciplines are data, information, knowledge and knowledge transformation. The knowledge can be defined as a dynamic human process of justifying personal beliefs. Knowledge is a product of successful decision-making process. Knowledge transformation is a spiralling process of interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge that leads to the new knowledge. Nonaka and al (2000) show, that the combination of these two categories makes possible to conceptualise four conversion steps: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation (SECI model). Another model of knowledge creation is the Knowledge Transformation Continuum (BCI Knowledge Group) that begins with the articulation of a specific instruction representing the best way that a specific task, or series of tasks, should be performed. Knowledge modelling and knowledge representation is an important field of research also in Computer Science andArtificial Intelligence. The definition of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is a noticeable different, because Artificial Intelligence is typically dealing with formalized knowledge (e.g. ontology). The development of knowledge-based systems was seen as a process of transferring human knowledge to an implemented knowledge base. Decision Support Systems (DSS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) modelling process support decision-making process, therefore they also produce a new knowledge. A Decision Support Systems are an interactive computer-based systems helping decision makers complete decision process. Geographic Information Systems provide essential marketing and customer intelligence solutions that lead to better business decisions. Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) is methodology based on system theory and theory of modelling. The OR/MS models serve for better quantification and precision of decision-making process. In this contribution the role of DSS, GIS and OR/MS models in the process of knowledge creation will be explained. The tacit or explicit character of this knowledge and the process of its creation will be explained and discussed. © 2009, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

However, it is sure that organizational knowledge management should pursue the achievement of the business goal by delivering relevant and useful information to the right person at the right time. Group Support Systems (GSS) can play an important role in transfering scattered information into meaningful business knowledge for supporting strategic corporate decision-making. This study proposes a fuzzy GSS framework for acquiring workgroup knowledge from individual memory and aggregating workgroup knowledge into organizational knowledge. This study also proposes an architecture to support the fuzzy GSS framework. The architecture consists of user agents, information management agents, and a fuzzy model manager. To illustrate how the fuzzy GSS framework can be used to support the whole process of organizational knowledge acquisition, an Internet-based GSS was developed and applied in a marketing decision process. It showed that the framework was effective for acquiring organizational knowledge. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence. The vision of digital marketing is therefore a fascinating one: marketing disappears at precisely the moment when it extends throughout the life without limit. © The Author(s) 2020.","algorithmic marketing; artificial intelligence; Big Data; consumer empowerment; digital marketing; hypernudging; manipulation; marketing automation; post-marketing; relevance; surveillance capitalism","","","","","","","","(2015); Albee A., Digital Relevance: Developing Marketing Content and Strategies That Drive Results, (2015); Anderson B., Facing the future enemy: U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine and the pre-insurgent, Theory, Culture & Society, 28, 7-8, pp. 216-240, (2011); Andrejevic M., Theorizing drones and droning theory, Drones and Unmanned Aerial Systems – Legal and Social Implications for Security and Surveillance, pp. 21-43, (2016); Andrejevic M., To preempt a thief, International Journal of Communication, 11, pp. 879-896, (2017); Itunes Store and Privacy, (2018); Ardholdt D.C., Gudergan S.P., Ringle C.M., Enhancing loyalty: When improving consumer satisfaction and delight matters, Journal of Business Research, 94, January, pp. 18-27, (2019); Arvidsson A., Colleoni E., Value in informational capitalism and on the internet, The Information Society, 28, 3, pp. 135-150, (2012); Ball K., Di Domenico M., Nunan D., Big data surveillance and the body-subject, Body & Society, 22, 2, pp. 58-81, (2016); Beer D., Burrows R., Popular culture, digital archives and the new social life of data, Theory, Culture & Society, 30, 4, pp. 47-71, (2013); Bilic P., Search algorithms, hidden labour and information control, Big Data & Society, 3, 1, pp. 1-9, (2016); Bilic P., A critique of the political economy of algorithms: A brief history of Google’s technological rationality, Triplec: Communication, Capitalism & Critique.

Our explanations are at once empirically motivated and formally sound, retaining the advantages of both artificial-intelligence and decision-theoretic representations for modeling decisions. We demonstrate the explanation strategies with implemented examples in the domains of marketing, process control, and medicine. Although previous approaches to modeling decisions in expert systems often have sacrificed formal specification for transparent operation, our methodology suggests that knowledge engineers can retain the benefits of decision theory without compromising intuitive explanation. © 1994.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Expert systems; Formal logic; Marketing; Mathematical models; Medicine; Process control; Decision theoretic advice; Diverse expert system domain; Multiattribute value theory; Therapy planning model; Decision theory","","","","","U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM, (LM05208, LM07033)","We thank Leslie Perreault, Eric Clemons, Martin Weber, and Tim Finin for many useful discussions.

The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The social networks have accumulated a large amount of information, which can be used in different ways. One of such possible purposes is advertising. In particular, when a company pays for advertising in a social network, it wants to get an ideal deployment of the ads on the network. The ideal behavior aims at reducing the high costs to pay, the number of hours to design advertising, the difficulty in the creation of ads by lots, among other things. In particular, the optimization of the production of advertising on social networks, based on the performance of the ads, is not an easy task. If we make an incorrect design, this can result in losses for a company. In this sense, this paper presents an intelligent system of management of social network advertising, based on data mining techniques, to automatically produce ads. In addition, we test our adaptive mechanism of automated production (generation) of online advertising on Facebook. Our system carries out automatic modifications and improvements of ads. Facebook is one of the more popular social networks, being widely used by companies for advertising, in order to create contents attracting the attention of users. © 2014 IEEE.","Decision support systems; Facebook; intelligent systems; online advertising; social networks","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Industry; Information management; Intelligent systems; Marketing; Online systems; Production; Adaptive mechanism; Automated productions; Facebook; High costs; Ideal behavior; Intelligent management systems; Large amounts; Online advertising; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Aggarwal C., Social Network Data Analytics, (2011); Aguilar J., Teran O., Social media and free knowledge: Case study: Public opinion formation, Societal Benefits of Freely Accessible Technologies and Knowledge Resources, J, pp. 156-190, (2015); Aguilar J., A general ant colony model to solve combinatorial optimization problems, Revista Colombiana Comput., 2, pp. 7-18, (2001); Aguilar J., Miranda P., Approaches based on genetic algorithms for multiobjetive optimization problems, Proc.

Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy. In this study, we propose a model that predicts audience numbers on the opening Saturday using market research data obtained through online and offline surveys to help distributors develop better marketing strategies. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Artificial intelligence; Box office; Decision support system; Machine learning; Marketing","","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea, (2018R1D1A1A02045842)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea ( 2018R1D1A1A02045842 ).

However, though many firms want to take advantage of AI to improve marketing, they lack a process by which to execute a Marketing AI project. This article discusses the use of AI to provide support for marketing decisions. Based on the established Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, it creates a process for managers to use when executing a Marketing AI project and discusses issues that might arise. It explores how this framework was used to develop three cutting-edge Marketing AI applications. © The Regents of the University of California 2019.","Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Marketing; Social media; Social networks","","","","","","Laboratory for Analytic Sciences","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work supported in whole or in part with funding from the Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS).","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","00081256","","","","English","Calif.

Weather data have long been considered a crucial external data input in practitioners’ marketing strategy; however, academic research on how weather conditions affect consumer behaviors has been limited. To fill this gap, this research investigates how weather parameters, including sunlight, temperature, and air quality, can be incorporated into MDSS to predict consumers’ variety-seeking in their purchases using public weather data and supermarket panel data for five typical retail products. Our analyses show that weather conditions are associated with greater variety-seeking behavior. The results afford insights into how to exploit weather data for data analytics and employ weather targeting strategies to save promotional expenses and increase profitability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China big data; Data analytics; Marketing decision support system; Mehrabian-Russell model; Variety-seeking; Weather data","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Decision support systems; Marketing; Meteorology; Academic research; Business effectiveness; Data analytics; Marketing decision; Marketing strategy; Variety-seeking; Weather data; Weather parameters; Big data","","","","","China Ministry of Education-China, (20150402); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71471021, 71702103)","This work was supported by China Ministry of Education-China Mobile research grant (#MCM20150402), and National Science Foundation of China (grant #71471021 and 71702103 ).

Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.

This paper also explores the scope of artificial intelligence and the challenges with regards to its application. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is adopted for this research, wherein the data has been collected through conducting one on one telephonic interviews (some in questionnaire format) and a roundtable conference with the general managers and marketing communication managers of 30 New Delhi/National Capital Region (NCR) hotels respectively to understand the transition from traditional to digital marketing era and how are they using various social media marketing tools. Findings: This study aims to inform how digitalization has benefitted the industry in various aspects and its comparison to the traditional marketing methods. It also discovers the future of artificial intelligence in the Indian hospitality space. Practical implications: This study aims to help managerial decision-making in the application of various E-marketing tools and strategies, suggesting the right mix of both traditional and digital marketing platforms. Originality/value: Arguably this is one of a kind study, as there has been no such research done specifically aiming at the five-star hotels of the Indian market. The findings will help the industry explore and enhance their digital presence by suggesting the appropriate mix of both traditional and digital approaches and can be used as a good source for further exploring the perspective of digitalization by academicians as well. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Digital marketing; Digitalization; E-marketing tools; Social media marketing; Traditional marketing","","","","","","","","Arya A., How important is digital marketing for Indian hospitality industry, (2016); Bagley E., Lanz L., The digital direction part 2: content and marketing communications, (2014); Baidya S., Goenka G., 2H19 country report on IT services – India, (2020); Barry C., Markey R., Almquist E., Brahm C., Putting social media to work, (2011); Chang T., Digital transformation in hospitality: a guide for luxury hotels, (2018); Digital advertising in India 2020, (2020); Gupta R., Changing sales, marketing, and customer engagement through technology in the hotel industry, (2019); (2019); Improved productivity and faster time to market primary drivers for Indian organizations looking at artificial intelligence, (2018); Ivanov S., Webster C., Berezina K., Adoption of robots and service automation by tourism and hospitality companies, Revista Turismo &Desenvolvimento, 27, 28, pp. 1501-1517, (2017); Jaganmohan M., Share of media channels used for marketing among Indian hotels 2017, (2019); Kaushik P.C., Khanna K., Is social hotel the future of Indian hospitality, International Research Journal of Management, IT and Social Sciences, 4, 60, (2017); Keelery S., Digital advertising revenue in India FY 2008-2024, (2020); Kotler P., Kartajaya H., Setiawan I., Marketing 4.0, (2017); McCaskill A., Recommendations from friends remain most credible form of advertising among consumers; branded websites are the second highest rated form, (2015); Malhotra N.K., Dash S., Marketing Research: An Applied Orientation, (2009); Samala N., Katkam B.S., Bellamkonda R.S., Rodriguez R.V., Impact of AI and robotics in the tourism sector: a critical insight, Journal of Tourism Futures, ahead-of-print, ahead-of-print, (2020); Shejale P., Tips to perfect digital strategy for travel and tourism brands in India, (2019); Getting smarter by sector: how 13 global industries use artificial intelligence, (2017); Artificial intelligence business value globally to reach $1.2 trillion in 2018, (2018); Key takeaways from Mary Meeker’s 2019 internet trends report, (2019); TripBarometer, TripAdvisor 2013, (2013); Visser M., Sikkenga B., Berry M., Digital Marketing Fundamentals, (2018); Wali B., TEDx talks, (2017); Yang L., Henthorne T.L., George B., ‘Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Technology in the Hospitality Industry: Current Applications and Future Trends’, Digital Transformation in Business and Society, pp. 211-228, (2020); Artificial intelligence an enabler for intelligent hotels, (2018); Naik S., Daptardar V., Role of artificial intelligence in development of hotel industry, International Journal for Innovative Research in Multidisciplinary Field, (2019)","R.

Traditional approach of applying intelligent techniques to solve complex manufacturing problems is to build an expert system. Conventional process of building an expert systems is labor intensive to elicit knowledge from the human experts. We thus propose a novel technique of automatic knowledge acquisition by means of the data mining method to remedy the problem and help supporting intelligent manufacturing systems. Knowledge in our tool can be discovered from the stored data using the decision tree induction algorithm. The learned tree structure is then transformed to a rule set that can be integrated into the knowledge base. The implementation of our knowledge acquisition tool is based on the logic programming scheme. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Genetic fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; KDD; Management support; Unsupervised learning","","","","","","Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia, (TIN2008-06681-CO6-01, TIN2008-06681-CO6-05); Generalitat de Catalunya, (2005SGR-00302); Junta de Andalucía, (P07-TIC-3185)","The authors would like to thank Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia for its support under projects TIN2008-06681-CO6-01 and TIN2008-06681-CO6-05 , Generalitat de Catalunya for its support under grant 2005SGR-00302 , and Junta de Andalucía for its support under project P07-TIC-3185 .

Smith School of Business of University of Maryland, College Park, United States; Sun B., Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business Americas, New York, United States","Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

A manager that deals with the problem has to decide on a number of issues, such as how to simulate the consumer choice process, which optimization algorithm to apply, and how to model the competitors' retaliatory moves. The existing information systems fail to provide the decision maker with the unique blend of techniques and resources required by the problem. In order to follow the way that marketing managers comprehend the optimal product process, in this paper the problem is broken down into distinct services, each one of them maps into a basic feature (simulation, optimization, competition analysis, etc.). All services are aggregated to a marketing decision support system by a service oriented architecture, achieving this way a decision-makers friendly environment, since the marketing managers are able to get a solution without the need to transfer data and parameters from one software to another, and without the need to coordinate manually the whole process.

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation","","","","","","","","Abijith A., Wamba S.F., Business value of RFID-enabled healthcare transformation projects, Business Process Management Journal, 19, 1, (2012); Barney J., Wright M., Ketchen D.J., The resource-based view of the firm: ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Benko A., Lanyi C.S., History of artificial intelligence, Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 1759-1762, (2009); Benner M.J., Dynamic or static capabilities?

Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Data mining involves extracting interesting patterns from data and can be found at the heart of operational research (OR), as its aim is to create and enhance decision support systems. Even in the early days, some data mining approaches relied on traditional OR methods such as linear programming and forecasting, and modern data mining methods are based on a wide variety of OR methods including linear and quadratic optimization, genetic algorithms and concepts based on artificial ant colonies. The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance. In this paper, we outline a series of upcoming trends and challenges for data mining and its role within OR. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

As a result, decision-making becomes highly challenging in the alignment of decisions to support the success of business goals. Specifically, environmental management is closely related to several levels in the enterprise structure, since they share a large amount of data and information. Hence, effective integration of environmental issues by means of tools improving information sharing and communication, may play a crucial role for the enhanced enterprise operation from an environmental perspective. In this sense, knowledge management technologies have proved to be highly promising for supporting this integration task. In this work, an ontological framework is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models sharing for the environmental assessment of the enterprise. The ontological model is applied to a case study considering a supply chain network design-planning and a process scheduling problem. The ontology provides an enterprise decision-making supporting tool by combining different information systems, which adapts and recognizes the different elements associated with the enterprise functions, and facilitates assessing the environmental performance of enterprises. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are a number of product categories for which only inaccurate sales figures or data about marketing efforts exist (e.g., because a significant part of the sales is realized in stores without scanners or which do not make the data available to firm outsiders). In such cases, reliable quantitative findings about the impact of marketing-mix variables on sales may not be achievable but qualitative reasoning may, at least, indicate likely implications of past or planned marketing activities in terms of directions of change. Even in markets with good data qualitative reasoning may be a worthwhile first modelling approach when market conditions change so significantly that a previously used model is deemed unsatisfactory and not enough data exist yet for a specification of a revised quantitative model. We show specifically how qualitative reasoning can be used to diagnose and predict market share changes. The diagnostic part represents a combination of qualitative reasoning and extensions of a previously published rule-based expert system for that task while the prognostic part is solely based on qualitative process theory and order of magnitude reasoning. © 1995.","Artificial intelligence; Market share analysis; Marketing; Qualitative reasoning","Computer simulation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Marketing; Market share analysis; Qualitative reasoning; Quantitative model; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Alpar, Expert Systems in Marketing, Working Paper 86-16 of the College of Business Administration, (1986); Alpar, Knowledge-Based Modelling of Marketing Managers' Problem Solving Behaviour, Int.

Incorporating cost-sensitive learning into forecasting models can improve the return on investment under resource constraint. This study proposes a cost-sensitive learning algorithm via priority sampling that gives greater weight to the high-value customers. We apply the method to three data sets and compare its performance with that of competing solutions. The results suggest that priority sampling compares favorably with the alternative methods in augmenting profitability. The learning algorithm can be implemented in decision support systems to assist marketing operations and to strengthen the strategic competitiveness of organizations. © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.
