While business-to-customer organizations have adopted BDA, its adoption in business-to-business (B2B) has been slow, raising concerns about the lack of understanding of the need to adopt BDA. Little knowledge exists on the subject and the purpose of this study is to examine BDA adoption needs among B2B organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) following the six-step SLR guidelines of Templier and Paré (2015) involved 1,051 articles, which were content analyzed. Findings: The authors offer two-pronged findings. First, on the basis of the SLR, the authors develop a new four-category classification scheme of needs to adopt BDA and present a consolidated review of the current knowledge base along with these categories (i.e. innovation, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and digital transformation). Second, underpinned by the theory of organizational motivation and literature evidence, the authors develop propositions and a corresponding model of BDA adoption needs. The authors show that BDA adoption among B2B organizations is driven by the need to augment customer lifetime value, champion the change, improve managerial decision cycle-time, tap into social media benefits and align with market transformation. Research limitations/implications: The results facilitate theory development as the study creates a new classification scheme of needs and a model of needs to adopt BDA in large B2B organizations. Practical implications: The findings will serve as a guideline framework for managers to examine their BDA adoption needs and strategize its adoption. Originality/value: The study develops a new four-category classification scheme for understanding B2B organizations’ needs to adopt big data analytics. The study also develops a new model of needs which will serve as a stepping stone for the development of a theory of needs of technology adoption. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data analytics;

Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to “big data,” and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight—the soul—the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for “what-if” and “but-for” applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul. The brightest future is based on the synergy of what the machine can do well and what humans do well. We provide examples and predictions for the future. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Knowledge; Machine learning; Marketing applications","","","","","","","","Athey S., Tibshirani J., Wager S., Generalized random forests, The Annals of Statistics, 47, 2, pp. 1148-1178, (2019); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Buschken J., Allenby G.M., Sentence-based text analysis for customer reviews, Marketing Science, 35, 6, pp. 953-975, (2016); Burnap A., Hauser J.R., Timoshenko A., Design and evaluation of product aesthetics: A human-machine hybrid approach, (2019); Calvano E., Calzolari G., Denicolo V., Pastorello S., Artificial intelligence, algorithmic pricing and collusion.

Therefore, the purpose of the study is to provide solutions for the sustainable development of NEV. Design/methodology/approach: The sustainable marketing strategy of NEV in China is put forward. This paper first analyzes the subsidy policy effect of NEV under the background of big data. It then establishes the online optimal leasing strategy under multiple strategy choices and the online leasing strategy of multiple vehicles under the inflation market. Findings: With the fixed cost of NEV in each lease period, the optimal competition ratio of online decision-makers will continue to decrease with the increase of the difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies. In the decision-making of renting and purchasing multiple vehicles, the general strategy competition ratio is 2.922, while the optimal competition ratio of the online renting and purchasing strategy proposed by the research is 2.723. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the limited data and information collected, so the optimal decision-making model has some limitations. The authors need to find more representative data to optimize the model. Practical implications: As an emerging industry, NEV have developed rapidly in recent years. Based on the online algorithm and competitive ratio theory, this paper solves the decision-making problem of operators and gives the optimal strategy to promote the green development of the new energy vehicle industry. Originality/value: This paper proposes the optimal strategy for online investors of new energy vehicle operators by combining online algorithm and competitive ratio theory. The numerical analysis results of the optimal online model under multi strategy selection show that with the same difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies, the time point will be delayed and the time point will be advanced as the cost of leasing NEV in each period increases. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Big data economy; Competitive ratio; Lease-purchase model; New energy vehicles; Online algorithm","","","","","","","","Cai W., Wu X., Zhou M., Review and development of electric motor systems and electric powertrains for new energy vehicles, Automotive Innovation, 4, 1, pp. 3-22, (2021); Chen C., Xu Y., Zhu Y., Online MapReduce scheduling problem of minimizing the makespan, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 33, 2, pp. 590-608, (2017); Chong A.Y.L., Cheng E., Liu M.J., Predicting consumer product demands via Big Data: the roles of online promotional marketing and online reviews, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 17-18, pp. 1-15, (2017); Cui Q., Wang Y., Chen K.C., Big data analytics and network calculus enabling intelligent management of autonomous vehicles in a smart city, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 2, pp. 2021-2034, (2019); Johnson J.S., Friend S.B., Lee H.S., Big data facilitation, utilization, and monetization: exploring the 3Vs in a new product development process, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 34, 5, pp. 640-658, (2017); Li B., Kisacikoglu M.C., Liu C., Big data analytics for electric vehicle integration in green smart cities, IEEE Communications Magazine, 55, 11, pp. 19-25, (2019); Li Z., Li Y., Pan W., Economic research and suggestions on the recycling of waste power batteries for China's new energy vehicles, E3S Web of Conferences, 165, 2, pp. 01028-01033, (2020); Lin J., Analysis of the effect of financial subsidy on China's new energy vehicle industry R & D activities, Modern Economy, 10, 1, pp. 96-107, (2019); Ma S.C., Fan Y., Feng L., An evaluation of government incentives for new energy vehicles in China focusing on vehicle purchasing restrictions, Energy Policy, 110, pp. 609-618, (2017); Mensah I., Quaye D.M., Marketing innovation and sustainable competitive advantage of manufacturing SMEs in Ghana, Management Decision, 57, 67, pp. 1535-1553, (2019); Nie Z., Lin Y., Jin X., Research on the theory and application of adsorbed natural gas used in new energy vehicles: a review, Frontiers of Mechanical Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 258-274, (2018); Peng Z., Price-dependent decision of new energy vehicles considering subsidies and backorders, Energy Procedia, 105, pp. 2065-2070, (2017); Sinan W., Fuquan Z., Zongwei L., Impacts of a super credit policy on electric vehicle penetration and compliance with China's corporate Average Fuel Consumption regulation, Energy, 155, pp. 746-762, (2018); Singh S.K., El-Kassar A.N., Role of big data analytics in developing sustainable capabilities, Journal of Cleaner Production, 213, MAR.10, pp. 1264-1273, (2019); Sultana S., Akter S., Kyriazis E., Architecting and developing big data-driven innovation (DDI) in the digital economy, Journal of Global Information Management, 29, 3, pp. 165-187, (2021); Sun J., Li G., Wang Z., Optimizing China's energy consumption structure under energy and carbon constraints, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 47, DEC, pp. 57-72, (2018); Tan R., Tang D., Lin B., Policy impact of new energy vehicles promotion on air quality in Chinese cities, Energy Policy, 118, pp. 33-40, (2018); Tan Z., Yang Y., Wang P., Charging behavior analysis of new energy vehicles, Sustainability, 13, 9, pp. 4837-4856, (2021); Verma S., Bhattacharyya S.S., Perceived strategic value-based adoption of Big Data Analytics in emerging economy, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 30, 3, pp. 354-382, (2017); Wang S., Chen K., Zhao F., Technology pathways for complying with Corporate Average Fuel Consumption regulations up to 2030: a case study of China, Applied Energy, 241, pp. 257-277, (2019); Wang L., Ma J., Zhao X., Li X., Development of a typical urban driving cycle for battery electric vehicles based on kernel principal component analysis and random forest, IEEE Access, 9, 1, pp. 15053-15065, (2021); Yu H., Dai H., Tian G., Key technology and application analysis of quick coding for recovery of retired energy vehicle battery, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 135, pp. 110129-110145, (2021); Zhang X.P.S., Wang F., Signal processing for finance, economics, and marketing: concepts, framework, and big data applications, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 34, 3, pp. 14-35, (2017)","T.

However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques. The main contribution of this research effort is twofold: the definition of a general-purpose BFF/Sentiment Analysis methodology and the development of a prediction model from online UGC based on the Big Five personality traits in the tourism research scenario. © 2022 Ikenga.

One of these is Big Data Analytics (BDA), which enables a firm to improve its marketing practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate how integrating big data technology improves the marketing strategies of Indian FMCG companies operating in a dynamic and highly competitive market distinguished by its size and diversity, constantly changing consumer behaviour, and Marketing 4.0 trends. This study adopts a systematic approach to coding an interview with seasoned Indian FMCG professionals to explain the capabilities of Big Data in molding marketing practices. A framework is constructed based on the same. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed to visualize its applicability in business. Further, the Resource-based View (RBV) theory is discussed for describing the insights into the role and adoption of Big Data by Indian FMCG firms for enhancing performance and achieving competitiveness, along with demonstrating its benefits for decision-making, customer loyalty and internal capability assessment. © 2024 The Author(s)","Big data analytics; Digital marketing; FMCG; Marketing 4.0; Resource based view","","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Sarker S., Chiang R.H., Big Data research in information systems: Toward an inclusive research agenda, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17, 2, (2016); Acciarini C., Cappa F., Boccardelli P., Oriani R., How can organizations leverage big data to innovate their business models?

However, academic research on how weather factors affect specific takeaway foods is limited. This paper aims to fill in the gap and therefore to contribute to online marketing and operation. Design/methodology/approach: Web crawler techniques were first exploited to collect takeaway food ordering data from Meituan, the world’s largest GMV platform. Then statistics models and a time series regression model were selected to study the weather impact on online orders. Findings: The findings highlight that certain weather factors, such as temperature, air quality and rainfall have clear effects on most category takeaway orders. Originality/value: Quantitative analysis of weather impacts on the takeaway ordering business will help to guide the online service platforms for marketing promotion and the settled businesses to make reasonable arrangements for inventory and marketing tactics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; M-R model; Takeaway ordering; Weather influence; Web crawler","Air quality; Decision making; Marketing; Regression analysis; Time series; Academic research; Consumer decision making; Design/methodology/approach; On-line service; Online marketing; Statistics model; Time-series regression; Weather factors; Web crawler","","","","","","","Arunraj N.S., Ahrens D., A hybrid seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average and quantile regression for daily food sales forecasting, International Journal of Production Economics, 170, pp. 321-335, (2015); Bakhshi S., Kanuparthy P., Gilbert E., Demographics, weather and online reviews: a study of restaurant recommendations, Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 443-454, (2014); Baron R.A., Bell P.A., Aggression and heat: the influence of ambient temperature, negative affect, and a cooling drink on physical aggression, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33, 3, (1976); Bertrand J.-L., Parnaudeau M., No more blaming the weather: a retailer’s approach to measuring and managing weather variability, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 45, 7-8, pp. 730-761, (2017); Blow J., Patel S., Gregg R., The sociocultural aspects of takeaway food consumption in a low-socio-economic ward in the large metropolitan city of Manchester: a grounded theory study, Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 76, OCE4, (2017); Canetti L., Bachar E., Berry E.M., Food and emotion, Behavioural Processes, 60, 2, pp. 157-164, (2002); Chevalier J.A., Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); Chong A.Y.L., Ch'ng E.B., Liu M.J., Li B.Y., Predicting consumer product demands via big data: the roles of online promotional marketing and online reviews, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 17, pp. 5142-5156, (2017); Christensen L., Brooks A., Changing food preference as a function of mood, The Journal of Psychology, 140, 4, pp. 293-306, (2006); Cummins S., Macintyre S., Food environments and obesity – neighbourhood or nation?, International Journal of Epidemiology, 35, 1, pp. 100-104, (2006); Davies A., Dolega L., Arribas-Bel D., Buy online collect in-store: exploring grocery click&collect using a national case study, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 47, 3, pp. 278-291, (2019); Denissen J.J., Butalid L., Penke L., Van Aken M.A., The effects of weather on daily mood: a multilevel approach, Emotion, 8, 5, (2008); Dewall C.N., Twenge J.M., Gitter S.A., Baumeister R.F., It’s the thought that counts: the role of hostile cognition in shaping aggressive responses to social exclusion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 96, 1, pp. 45-59, (2009); Evers C., Dingemans A., Junghans A.F., Boeve A., Feeling bad or feeling good, does emotion affect your consumption of food?

In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts. Findings: Drawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a ‘hacking marketing’ approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries. Practical implications: This study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study’s results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital marketing;

It helps to better understand and predict trends and results, and rationalise decisions. The fourth industrial revolution has brought marketing 4.0, affecting marketing analytics methods. This study provides a holistic framework to investigate these effects on Marketing 4.0 analytics. To achieve this goal, a hybrid systematic literature review (SLR) and thematic analysis (TA) is conducted on the applications and models of B2B marketing analytics in Industry 4.0 from the most reliable scientific databases. Understanding these models and their applications changes the attitude toward communication between marketing channels, identifies potential marketing analytics applications for businesses, and facilitates areas for further research. Initially, 941 sources were screened, and ultimately 43 were examined. As a result, 25 codes were applied, and six themes were extracted, including Digital Transformation, Big Data, Marketing Analytics, Marketing, Analytics, and Customer. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig.&#x00A0;1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management&#x0027;s post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study&#x0027;s findings were used to develop Fig.&#x00A0;2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management&#x0027;s support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study&#x0027;s hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE&#x0027;s critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management&#x0027;s decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations&#x2019; FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context. The implications and limitations are discussed.

Although an extensive amount of research has been developed in B2C and B2B marketing context, few social media studies take a dive into potential linkages between external and internal marketing contexts in an industry specific paradigm. This study aims to bridge B2C and B2B social media marketing, by adopting the outside-in perspective as theoretical lens. Using a large-scale dataset, collected from a micro-blogging site, and consumer-oriented information assembled from multiple sources, we empirically examine the inter-relationship between firm-generated messages, consumer digital engagement, and firm sales performance in the movie industry. Theoretically, this study builds upon the outside-in perspective and extends the current knowledge of the outside-in perspective to the social media context. It also bridges the B2C and B2B marketing literature by demonstrating that the insight garnered from B2C social media interactions should be integrated into the B2B firm interactions, communications, and decision makings. Managerially, this study provides movie practitioners with important implications. © 2021","Big data analysis; Consumer digital engagement; Firm-generated content; Outside-in perspective; Social media","","","","","","Solutions for Aging Societies, (GZ 1570); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (91546121)","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: 91546121 ] and Digital Transformation in China and Germany: Strategies, Structures and Solutions for Aging Societies [grant number: GZ 1570 ].","Agnihotri R., Dingus R., Hu M.Y., Krush M.T., Social media: Influencing custome satisfaction in B2B sales, Industrial Marketing Management, 53, pp. 172-180, (2016); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akpinar E., Berger J., Valuable virality, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 318-330, (2017); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Redefining virality in less broad strokes: Predicting viral behavioral intentions from motivations and uses of Facebook and twitter, New Media & Society, 17, 8, pp. 1317-1339, (2014); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Quilliam E.T., Richards J.I., Lou C., Alcohol's getting a bit more social: When alcohol marketing messages on Facebook increase young adults’ intentions to imbibe, Mass Communication and Society, 18, 3, pp. 350-375, (2015); Armstrong J.S., Persuasive advertising: Evidence-based principles, (2010); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology and Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Berger J., Schwartz E.M., What drives immediate and ongoing word of mouth?, Journal of Marketing Research, 48, 5, pp. 869-880, (2011); Bill F., Feurer S., Klarmann M., Salesperson social media use in business-to-business relationships: An empirical test of an integrative framework linking antecedents and consequences, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 4, pp. 734-752, (2020); Brennen R., Croft R., The use of social media in B2B marketing and branding: An exploratory study, Journal of Customer Behaviour, 11, 2, pp. 101-115, (2012); Calder B.J., Isaac M.S., Malthouse E.C., Taking the customer's point-of-view: Engagement or satisfaction?, (2013); Calder B.J., Malthouse E.C., Schaedel U., An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 23, 4, pp. 321-331, (2009); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Count panel data, (2013); Cao D., Meadows M., Wong D., Xia S., Understanding consumers' social media engagement behaviour: An examination of the moderation effect of social media context, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 835-846, (2021); Chen K., Yin J., Information competition in product launch: Evidence from the movie industry, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 26, pp. 81-88, (2017); Chen Z., Berger J., When, why, and how controversy causes conversation, Journal of Consumer Research, 40, 3, pp. 580-593, (2013); Chevalier J.A., Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); Choudhary V., Currim I., Dewan S., Jeliazkow I., Mintz O., Turner J., Evaluation set size and purchase: Evidence from a product search engine, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 37, pp. 16-31, (2017); Colicev A., Kumar A., O'Connor P., Modeling the relationship between firm and user generated content and the stages of the marketing funnel, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 36, 1, pp. 100-116, (2019); Colicev A., Malshe A., Pauwels K., O'Connor P., Improving consumer mindset metrics and shareholder value through social media: The different roles of owned and eared media, Journal of Marketing, 82, 1, pp. 37-56, (2018); Cortez R.M., Johnston W.J., The future of B2B marketing theory: A historical and prospective analysis, Industrial Marketing Management, 66, pp. 90-102, (2017); Coulter K.S., Punj G.N., The effects of cognitive resource requirements, availability, and argument quality on brand attitudes: A melding of elaboration likelihood and cognitive resource matching theories, Journal of Advertising, 33, 4, pp. 53-64, (2004); Coursaris C.K., Van Osch W., Balogh B.A., Informing brand messaging strategies via social media analytics, Online Information Review, 40, 1, pp. 6-24, (2016); Darke P.R., Ritchie R.J.B., The defensive consumer: Advertising deception, defensive processing, and distrust, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 1, pp. 114-127, (2007); Das G., Wiener H.J., Kareklas I., To emoji or not to emoji?

One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers. These findings have the potential to improve influencer identification effectiveness and efficiency, and thus improve influencer marketing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Influencers; Market mavens; Social media; Twitter","Big data; Decision making; Decision support systems; Marketing; Outsourcing; Social networking (online); Digital marketing; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Information systems managers; Marketing decision; Mixed method; Publicly accessible; Social media; Survey data; Commerce","","","","","BHP Billiton","This work was supported by BHP Billiton, Australia .

We evaluate an organic approach of departmental sensemaking and an administered approach by which top management increase the influence of analytics skilled employees. Data collection commenced with 15 depth interviews of marketing and analytics professionals in the US and Europe involved in the implementation of big data analytics (BDA) and was followed by a survey data of 298 marketing and analytics middle management professionals at United States based firms. The survey data supports the logic that BDA sensemaking is initiated by top management and is comprised of four primary activities: external knowledge acquisition, improving digitized data quality, big data analytics experimentation and big data analytics information dissemination. Top management drives progress toward data-driven decision-making by facilitating sensemaking and by increasing the influence of BDA skilled employees. This study suggests that while a shift toward enterprise analytics increases the quality of resource available to the marketing department, this approach could stymie the quality of marketing insights gained from BDA. This study presents a model of how to improve the quality of marketing insights and improve data-driven decision-making. © 2021 by the authors.

As numerous managerial decisions in the field of marketing are becoming evidence-based, business schools have integrated case studies about different stages of data analytics such as problem identification, data collection, data processing, data analysis and data visualization in order to improve the knowledge of marketing students. Although case studies can provide a good theoretical foundation about data analytics in the field of marketing, but they may not be sufficient for building analytical skills from a technical perspective. This paper provides a guideline on how Python as a programming language can be used to explore large datasets and improve marketing students’ capabilities with a focus on data processing, data analysis and data visualization tasks. In this research, a survey was conducted to measure the teaching effectiveness and overall satisfaction of marketing students (n = 84) in a Canadian university. The evidence suggests that Python libraries designed for marketing-related data analysis and data visualization have positive outcomes in students’ learning experience and perception of teaching effectiveness. © 2022 Society for Marketing Advances.","","","","","","","","","Bridges E., Experiential learning and customer needs in the undergraduate marketing research course, Journal of Marketing Education, 21, 1, pp. 51-59, (1999); Davenport T.H., Barth P., Bean R., How big data is different, MIT Sloan Management Review, 54, 1, pp. 43-46, (2012); Gillentine A., Schulz J., Marketing the fantasy football league: Utilization of simulation to enhance sport marketing concepts, Journal of Marketing Education, 23, 3, pp. 178-186, (2001); Application trends survey report 2020, (2020); Hawes J.M., Foley L.M., Building skills with professional activity reports, Marketing Education Review, 16, 1, pp. 35-40, (2006); What is data visualization?, (2021); Li T., Greenberg B.A., Nicholls J., Teaching experiential learning: Adoption of an innovative course in an MBA marketing curriculum, Journal of Marketing Education, 29, 1, pp. 25-33, (2007); Liu X., Burns A.C., Designing a marketing analytics course for the digital age, Marketing Education Review, 28, 1, pp. 28-40, (2018); Marsh H.W., SEEQ: A reliable, valid, and useful instrument for collecting students’ evaluations of university teaching, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 52, 1, pp. 77-95, (1982); What is big data?, (2012); Schield M., Statistical literacy and evidential statistics, Paper presented at the ASA Proceedings of the Section on Statistical Education, (1998); Schield M., Statistical literacy: Thinking critically about statistics, Of Significance, 1, 1, pp. 15-20, (1999); Thontirawong P., Chinchanachokchai S., Teaching artificial intelligence and machine learning in marketing, Marketing Education Review, 31, 2, pp. 58-63, (2021)","A.

We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial-and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection. © 2021 by the authors.

In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference. The strong empirical evidence indicates that the big e-commerce consumer data facilitates more specialized market psychographic segmentation, which advances data-driven marketing decision-making. © The Author(s) 2019.","Amazon; big data-driven marketing; consumer preference prediction; lifestyles segmentation; personality; recommender system; text mining","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71271099, 71571084); China Scholarship Council, CSC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71571084, No. 71271099) and China Scholarship Council.

This information has been gathered because it may be important for dealing with complicated problems including fraud, marketing, healthcare, and cyber security. Analytics are used by big businesses like Facebook and Google to analyse and make decisions about their massive volumes of collected data. Such analyses and decisions impact both the present and the future of technology. The inherent non-linear properties in huge data may be captured by deep learning (DL) algorithms using automated feature extraction techniques. In order to estimate renewable energy, energy consumption, demand, and supply, among other things, over the short, medium, and long term, a complete and in-depth investigation of generative, hybrid, and discriminative DL models is being conducted. This article examines the benefits and drawbacks of DL that depends on a variety of deep neural networks, including recurrent neural networks, multilayer neural networks, auto encoders and long short-term memory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Big data analytics; Recurrent neural networks; Sequence data","Cybersecurity; Data Analytics; Deep neural networks; Energy utilization; Multilayer neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Automated feature extraction; Big data analytic; Cyber security; Data analytics; Decision impacts; Facebook; Feature extraction techniques; Google+; Nonlinear properties; Sequence data; Big data","","","","","","","Acharya S., Rai A., Venkatesh S., Ravindranath Chowdary C., A review of transfer learning in deep neural networks, J Big Data, 8, 1, pp. 1-21, (2021); Ahmad J., Larijani H., Emmanuel R., Mannion M., Javed A., Phillipson M., Energy demand prediction through novel random neural network predictor for large non-domestic buildings, Proc.

Asset management can be broken into the following tasks: (1) portfolio construction, (2) risk management, (3) capital management, (4) infra-structure and deployment, and (5) sales and marketing. This article focuses on portfolio construction using machine learning. Historically, algorithmic trading could be more narrowly defined as the automation of sell-side trade execution, but since the introduction of more advanced algorithms, the definition has grown to include idea generation, alpha factor design, asset allocation, position sizing, and the testing of strategies. Machine learning, from the vantage of a decision-making tool, can help in all these areas. © 2020, With intelligence.

The current study seeks to explore the evolution of sustainability in social media research through network and bibliometric analysis. The bibliographic themes in the field have been studied using citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrence and content analysis using the VOSviewer software. The Scopus database has been used to survey the literature from 2001 to 2023. To ensure accuracy in the data obtained, 757 documents were finalized through numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results suggest that sustainable development, marketing, perception, decision making and innovation were some of the most frequently studied topics in the area. The United States, China and the United Kingdom were the top contributing countries and Sustainability Switzerland, Journal Of Cleaner Production and Environmental Science and Pollution Research were some of the highly productive journals. Keywords such as big data, business development, economic and social effects, economic development and public attitude were less frequently studied, providing scope for future exploration. The study is one of the early attempts to research the development and evolution of sustainability in social media. It was found that the area is in its growth phase. As a result, it adds to the body of knowledge on social media and sustainability and opens new arenas for investigation. © 2024 Phcog.Net.

It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in data driven-marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the “right” customers, to “keep” and “grow” them and to sustain “growth” and “profitability”. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses, 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included retail, BFSI, healthcare and government, automobile, telecommunication, transport and logistics and IT. Other industries represented were aviation, marketing research and consulting, hospitality, advertising and media and human resource. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for DDM. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders and Leaders based on their “current level of investments” and “willingness to enhance investments” soon. Research limitations/implications: With storming digital age and the development of analytics, the process of decision-making has gained significant importance. Judgment and intuition too are critical to the process. Choosing an appropriate action cannot be done strictly on a rational basis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of DDM. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; however, attitudes and social factors are equally important. Originality/value: There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer centric; Data-driven marketing; Digital data; Digital marketing and marketing investment; Marketing analytics; Marketing dashboard; Marketing metrics; ROMI (return on marketing investment) and diffusion of innovation; Value proposition","","","","","","","","Agrawal D., Analytics-based decision making, Journal of Indian Business Research, 6, 4, pp. 332-340, (2014); Ashe-Edmunds S., Factors Influencing Decision Making in a Business Environment, (2017); Bertolucci J., Big Data Analytics: Descriptive vs. Predictive vs. Prescriptive, (2013); Belwal R., Belwal S., Hypermarkets in Oman: a study of consumers’ shopping preferences, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, (2014); Bhandari R., Singer M., van der Scheer H., Using Marketing Analytics to Drive Superior Growth, (2014); Bose R., Advanced analytics: opportunities and challenges, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 109, 2, pp. 155-172, (2009); Braverman S., Global review of data-driven marketing and advertising, Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 16, 3, pp. 181-183, (2015); Cao G., Duan Y., How do top-and bottom-performing companies differ in using business analytics?, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 30, 6, pp. 874-892, (2017); Carillo K.D.A., Galy N., Guthrie C., Vanhems A., How to turn managers into data-driven decision-makers: measuring attitudes towards business analytics, Business Process Management Journal, (2018); Chismar W.G., Wiley-Patton S., Does the extended technology acceptance model apply to physicians?, Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on, System Sciences, 2003, (2003); Chismar W.G., Wiley-Patton S., Does the Extended Technology Acceptance Model Apply to Physicians, (2003); Davenport T.H., Analytics 3.0, Harvard Business Review, (2013); Deevi S., The big data-driven business: how to use big data to win customers, beat competitors, and boost profits, Research-Technology Management, 58, 3, (2015); Desrosiers J., Dumas Y., Solomon M.M., Soumis F., Time constrained routing and scheduling, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 8, pp. 35-139, (1995); Desjardins J., The Evolution of Data, (2015); Farris P.W., Bendle N., Pfeifer P., Reibstein D., Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance, (2010); Fitzgerald M., How to hire data-driven leaders, MIT Sloan Management Review, 56, 3, (2015); Forbes, Welcome, (2016); Friedrich R., Grone F., Koster A., Le Merle M., Measuring Industry Digitization: Leaders and Laggards in the Digital Economy.

At the same time, there has been an explosion of text-based data and numerous advances in big data that enable marketers to mine the collection and aggregation of text. However, for many marketers there is a need to better understand how textual data can go beyond mere descriptive metrics to instead help solve real marketing problems. With this paper, we take a step in this direction. We first review key concepts and terms that are relevant to understanding how text analysis operates, as well as a new development in custom dictionary creation that expands the topics possible with text analysis. Next, we develop the FTTA grid, a new framework that enables text-derived metrics to inform actionable strategies for marketers. We present two real cases demonstrating how the FTTA grid can be employed in action. Finally, we discuss implications for both academics and marketing practitioners. © 2022","B2B marketing; Marketing insight; Marketing strategy; Text-analysis","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Big data analytics in E-commerce: A systematic review and agenda for future research, Electronic Markets, 26, 2, pp. 173-194, (2016); Amado A., Cortez P., Rita P., Moro S., Research trends on big data in marketing: A text mining and topic modeling based literature analysis, European Research on Management and Business Economics, 24, 1, pp. 1-7, (2018); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, pp. 557-590, (2018); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W.W., Netzer O., Schweidel D.A., Uniting the tribes: Using text for marketing insight, Journal of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Berthon P.R., Pitt L.F., Plangger K., Shapiro D., Marketing meets web 2.0, social media, and creative consumers: Implications for international marketing strategy, Business Horizons, 55, 3, pp. 261-271, (2012); Bradlow E.T., Gangwar M., Kopalle P., Voleti S., The role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing, Journal of Retailing, 93, 1, pp. 79-95, (2017); Brakus J.J., Schmitt B.H., Zarantonello L., Brand experience: What is it?

Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States","Purpose: Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners’ marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers’ decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Prediction; Restaurant reviews; Review helpfulness","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., Online review helpfulness: role of qualitative factors, Psychology and Marketing, 33, 11, pp. 1006-1017, (2016); Ahani A., Nilashi M., Ibrahim O., Sanzogni L., Weaven S., Market segmentation and travel choice prediction in spa hotels through TripAdvisor’s online reviews, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 80, pp. 52-77, (2019); Antonio N., de Almeida A.M., Nunes L., Batista F., Ribeiro R., Hotel online reviews: creating a multi-source aggregated index, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 12, pp. 3574-3591, (2018); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Banerjee S., Bhattacharyya S., Bose I., Whose online reviews to trust?

It highlights the importance of strategically designing image content for business marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study designed a computation extensive research model based upon the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory using 39,139 Facebook posts of 125 organizations selected from Fortune 500 firms. Attributes from images and text were estimated using deep learning models. Subsequently, inferential analysis was established with ordinary least squares regression. Further machine learning algorithms, like support vector regression, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree and random forest, are used to analyze the significance and robustness of the proposed model for predicting engagement metrics. Findings: The results indicate that the social media (SM) image content of B2B firms significantly impacts their social media engagement. The visual and linguistic attributes are extracted from the image using deep learning. The distinctive effect of each feature on social media engagement (SME) is empirically verified in this study. Originality/value: This research presents practical insights formulated by embedding marketing, advertising, image processing and statistical knowledge of SM analytics. The findings of this study provide evidence for the stimulating effect of image content concerning SME. Based on the theoretical implications of this study, marketing and media content practitioners can enhance the efficacy of SM posts in engaging users. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Deep learning; Multimodal analysis; Social media engagement; Stimulus-response model","Commerce; Computation theory; Data Analytics; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Modal analysis; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Big data analytic; Data analytics; Deep learning; Image content; Multimodal analysis; Response model; Social media; Social medium engagement; Stimulus response; Stimulus-response model; Big data","","","","","","","Agostini L., Bigliardi B., Filippelli S., Galati F., Seller reputation, distribution and intention to purchase refurbished products, Journal of Cleaner Production, 316, (2021); Ainin S., Parveen F., Moghavvemi S., Jaafar N.I., Mohd Shuib N.L., Factors influencing the use of social media by SMEs and its performance outcomes, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 115, 3, pp. 570-588, (2015); Bakhshi S., Shamma D.A., Gilbert E., Faces engage us: photos with faces attract more likes and comments on instagram, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 965-974, (2014); Balio S., Casais B., A content marketing framework to analyze customer engagement on social media, Research Anthology on Strategies for Using Social Media as a Service and Tool in Business, pp. 320-336, (2021); Benton L., Five reasons why B2B companies fail at content and social media marketing, B2B News Networks, (2017); Bindemann M., Burton A.M., Hooge I.T.C., Jenkins R., de Haan E.H.F., Faces retain attention, Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 12, 6, pp. 1048-1053, (2005); Bolognesi M., Strik Lievers F., How language and image construct synaesthetic metaphors in print advertising, Visual Communication, 19, 4, pp. 431-457, (2020); Caballero J., Gomez G., Matic S., Sanchez G., Sebastian S., Villacanas A., The rise of GoodFATR: a novel accuracy comparison methodology for indicator extraction tools, Future Generation Computer Systems, 144, pp. 74-89, (2023); De Oliveira Santini F., Ladeira W.J., Pinto D.C., Herter M.M., Sampaio C.H., Babin B.J., Customer engagement in social media: a framework and meta-analysis, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 6, pp. 1211-1228, (2020); De Vries L., Gensler S., Leeflang P.S.H., Popularity of brand posts on brand fan pages: an investigation of the effects of social media marketing, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 83-91, (2012); Deng Q., Wang Y., Rod M., Ji S., Speak to head and heart: the effects of linguistic features on B2B brand engagement on social media, Industrial Marketing Management, 99, pp. 1-15, (2021); Dolan R., Conduit J., Frethey-Bentham C., Fahy J., Goodman S., Social media engagement behavior: a framework for engaging customers through social media content, European Journal of Marketing, 53, 10, pp. 2213-2243, (2019); Gandhi M., Kar A.K., How do Fortune firms build a social presence on social media platforms?

This fact led to the emergence of big data, which in turn intensified innovation, led to new services and products such as real-time traffic information and personalized marketing and delivery services. While big data has led to efficiency gains, it has also sparked a new debate in antitrust: to what extent, if any, could data become a competitive concern? Objective: this article is a case study on the Brazilian retail market based on recent literature on barriers to entry fostered by data-based activities and the importance of data as an asset capable of creating market power and giving rise to anti-competitive practices. Method: a bibliographical review was carried out regarding the importance of data as a possible asset that creates barriers to entry, as well as the interpretation of the Brazilian antitrust authority – Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade), in recent mergers, in addition to an exploratory analysis of data on access and revenue of the main retail players in different market segments and business types. Conclusions: the article concludes that, taking into account the case study, it is not evident that big data leads to highly competitive advantages in the retail sector in Brazil and that competitive concerns do not extend to all data-intensive markets, as data can be segmented and provide different competitive advantages that do not imply relevant barriers to the Brazilian retail sector. © 2024, Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE).

Design/methodology/approach: The technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical base and data were gathered from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN). Findings: The findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS. Practical implications: The findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development. Originality/value: The manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations. However, the associations between BDA and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs have been less explored. To address this issue, this study developed a theoretical model and examined the influence of BDA on SM and SO of manufacturing SMEs. Meanwhile, the hybrid methodological approach can help to uncover both linear and non-linear relationships better. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data adoption; SMEs; Sustainable marketing; Sustainable operations","","","","","","","","Abidin I.S.Z., Reflections on the Malaysian Economy Post-GE 14: Issues and Challenges, (2021); Al-Emran M., Abbasi G.A., Mezhuyev V., Evaluating the impact of knowledge management factors on M-learning adoption: a deep learning-based hybrid SEM-ANN approach, Recent Advances in Technology Acceptance Models and Theories, pp. 159-172, (2021); Al-Sai Z.A., Abdullah R., Husin M.H., Critical success factors for big data: a systematic literature review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 118940-118956, (2020); Asadi S., Abdullah R., Safaei M., Nazir S., An integrated SEM-Neural Network approach for predicting determinants of adoption of wearable healthcare devices, Mobile Information Systems, pp. 1-9, (2019); Auzzir Z., Haigh R., Amaratunga D., Impacts of disaster to SMEs in Malaysia, Procedia Engineering, 212, pp. 1131-1138, (2018); Baig M.I., Shuib L., Yadegaridehkordi E., Big data in education: a state of the art, limitations, and future research directions, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, pp. 1-23, (2020); Baig M.I., Shuib L., Yadegaridehkordi E., A model for decision-makers’ adoption of big data in the education sector, Sustainability, 13, 24, (2021); Bernama, Malaysian investment development authority, (2021); Chatterjee S., Chaudhuri R., Shah M., Maheshwari P., Big data driven innovation for sustaining SME supply chain operation in post COVID-19 scenario: moderating role of SME technology leadership, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 168, (2022); Chou S.F., Horng J.S., Liu C.H., Yu T.Y., Kuo Y.T., Identifying the critical factors for sustainable marketing in the catering: the influence of big data applications, marketing innovation, and technology acceptance model factors, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 51, pp. 11-21, (2022); Cohen J., A power primer, Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159, (1992); Du K.L., Clustering: a neural network approach, Neural Networks, 23, 1, pp. 89-107, (2010); El-Haddadeh R., Osmani M., Hindi N., Fadlalla A., Value creation for realising the sustainable development goals: fostering organisational adoption of big data analytics, Journal of Business Research, 131, pp. 402-410, (2021); Gangwar H., Understanding the determinants of big data adoption in India: an analysis of the manufacturing and services sectors, Information Resources Management Journal (IRMJ), 31, 4, pp. 1-22, (2018); Ghasemaghaei M., Does data analytics use improve firm decision making quality?

Further, big data analytics has emerged as a game changer in the business world due to its uses for increasing accuracy in decision-making and enhancing performance of sustainable industry 4.0 applications. This study intends to emphasize on how to support Industry 4.0 with knowledge based view. For the same, a conceptual model is framed and presented with essential components that are required for a real world implementation. The study used qualitative analysis and was guided by a knowledge-based theoretical framework. Thematic analysis resulted in the identification of a number of emergent categories. Key findings highlight significant gaps in conventional decision-making systems and demonstrate how big data enhances firms’ strategic and operational decisions as well as facilitates informational access for improved marketing performance. The resulting proposed model can provide managers with a reference point for using big data to line up firms’ activities for more effective marketing efforts and presents a conceptual basis for further empirical studies in this area. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Knowledge-based view; Marketing performance","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Commerce; Data Analytics; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Knowledge based systems; Marketing; Advanced manufacturing; Conceptual model; Data analytics; Decisions makings; Knowledge-based views; Marketing performance; Performance; Qualitative analysis; Real-world implementation; Sustainable industries; artificial intelligence; data management; industrial performance; Internet; knowledge economy; manufacturing; marketing; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Emerald South Asia; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Shivam Gupta (Ph.D.) is an Associate Professor at NEOMA Business School, France with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry.

Quantitatively creating personas is gaining importance for its greater representability, objectivity, and fast creative speed. However, quantitative personas built using traditional statistical methods may not reflect the marketing goals of decision-makers, and they mainly focus on categorizing existing users rather than predicting target customers. To address the research gap, this study proposes a guideline to create a predictive persona by using data-mining algorithms resulting in personas that can be validated. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and credibility of personas to effectively predict new customers for target marketing. We demonstrate a step-by-step guideline for creating the proposed predictive persona using real user data, validating its credibility, and comparing its predictive power against traditional quantitative personas. We thoroughly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative personas, traditional quantitative personas, and predictive personas while portraying suitable scenarios in which each type of persona is appropriate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Data-mining; Persona; Predictive persona; Qualitative persona; Quantitative persona; Target marketing","Commerce; Data mining; Decision making; Marketing; Creatives; Persona; Predictive persona; Qualitative persona; Quantitative persona; Representability; Target marketing; User goals; User need; Users' experiences; Big data","","","","","","","Alkurd R., Abualhaol I., Yanikomeroglu H., Big-data-driven and AI-based framework to enable personalization in wireless networks, IEEE Commun.

However, actionable guidelines to promote a holistic adaptation and the effective functioning of destination marketing/management organizations (DMOs) in the increasingly data-infused world are still needed. This perspective paper posits a research-based framework that DMOs can use to become more responsive and efficient in their marketing and planning efforts in the current AI-infused world. Four propositions are presented to support DMOs’ transition to the insight-era: (a) DMOs’ organizational adaptations and workforce development and training, (b) active engagement with destinations’ stakeholders and data sharing, (c) leverage user-generated data and emergent technologies for destination marketing, and (d) DMOs’ data-driven decision making. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data; data-driven decision-making; data-driven eco-systems; destination marketing organizations; insight Era; the Internet of Things","","","","","","Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, TIP, (1937833)","","Castells M., The Information Age, Media Stud.

With a growing amount of big data available, fashion retailers need to innovate and develop more sophisticated analytics for new consumer behaviours such as m-commerce. This research has considered how Google Analytics data can be applied to develop customer journey maps to understand digital consumer behaviour. A multi-method research design was used, incorporating an innovative mobile eye tracking technology and mobile fashion consumer data from Google Analytics. Digital customers’ shopping journeys on the fashion retailer's website were mapped using data sourced from eye tracking and Google Analytics, gathered in parallel. The comparison of these shopping journeys allowed a critical evaluation of the precision and usefulness of the Google Analytics database. Google Analytics tracked only half of the digital users’ activities, whereas eye tracking data documented digital consumers’ interaction with all elements of the fashion retailer's website. The conclusion reached is that eye tracking can be used to audit the Google Analytics database for potential gaps in data and also to inform and improve marketing decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer shopping journey;

Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to many large-magnitude relationships between variables that do not signal causal effects. This exposure may carry a substantial cost. Seven studies demonstrate that the magnitudes of relationships between variables can distort consumers' judgments about whether those relationships reflect causal effects. Specifically, consumers often use a magnitude heuristic: consumers infer that relationships with larger perceived magnitudes are more likely to reflect causal effects, even when this is not true (and even when relationships' correlations are held constant). In many situations, relying on the magnitude heuristic will distort causality judgments, such as when large-magnitude relationships between variables are spurious, or when normatively extraneous factors (e.g., reference points) distort perceptions of magnitudes. Moreover, magnitude-distorted (mis)perceptions of causality, in turn, distort consumers' purchase and consumption decisions. Since consumers often encounter spurious relationships with large magnitudes in the health domain and in other consequential domains, the magnitude heuristic is likely to lead to biases in some of consumers' most important decisions.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Collecting and storing information on actual and potential voters, volunteers, and donors has produced extensive databases that are then used to guide microtargeting efforts related to advertising, organizing, and fundraising efforts. But building, maintaining, and analyzing this data are costly in itself. This paper looks at two aspects of data-driven political fundraising: precision and selectiveness, with respect to the alignment of the ideology of potential donors and the ideology of the candidate. Specifically, the proposed model is used to determine the optimal precision in estimating a donor’s location on the political ideology spectrum and the optimal targeting decision for fundraising solicitations given that estimate. Analysis of the model produces guidance for changes in solicitation cost and donation size. The results produced by the model are considered in light of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The analysis suggests that the Clinton campaign’s larger donation size likely played a greater role than did the campaign’s higher solicitation cost in terms of targeting. The model is also consistent with the Clinton campaign’s higher expenditures on analytics, given their larger donation size and solicitation cost. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Analytics; big data; data-driven marketing; direct marketing; fundraising; microtargeting; political campaigning","","","","","","","","Allison B., Rojanasakul M., Harris B., Sam C., (2016); Arterton F.C., “Campaign Organizations Confront the Media-Political Environment.”, Race for the Presidency, pp. 3-24, (1978); Bartels L.M., Presidential Primaries and the Dynamics of Public Choice, (1988); Brown C.W., Powell L.W., Wilcox C., Serious Money: Fundraising and Contributing in Presidential Nomination Campaigns, (1995); Brown M.S., (2016); Bult J.R., Wansbeek T., “Optimal Selection for Direct Mail.”, Marketing Science, 14, 4, pp. 378-394, (1995); (2016); Francia P.L., Green J.C., Herrnson P.S., Powell L.W., Wilcox C., The Financiers of Congressional Elections: Investors, Ideologues, and Intimates, (2003); Gibson G., Smith G., (2016); Godwin R.K., “The Structure, Content, and Use of Political Direct Mail.”, Polity, 20, 3, pp. 527-538, (1988); Hassell H.J.G., “Looking Beyond the Voting Constituency: A Study of Campaign Donation Solicitations in the 2008 Presidential Primary and General Election, Journal of Political Marketing, 10, pp. 27-42, (2011); Hassell H.J.G., Monson J.Q., “Campaign Targets and Messages in Direct Mail Fundraising, Political Behavior, 36, pp. 359-376, (2013); Hersh E.D., Hacking the Electorate, (2015); (2015); Hillygus D.S., Shields T.G., The Persuadable Voter: Wedge Issues in Presidential Campaigns, (2008); Hinckley K.A., Green J.C., “Fund-Raising in Presidential Campaigns: The Primary Lessons of 1988, Political Research Quarterly, 49, 4, pp. 693-618, (1996); Issenberg S., (2015); Issenberg S., (2015); Kaye K., (2016); Kuehner-Hebert K., (2012); McDonald M., Licari P., Merivaki L., (2015); Murray G.R., Scime A., “Microtargeting and Electorate Segmentation: Data Mining the American National Election Studies.”, Journal of Political Marketing, 9, 3, pp. 143-166, (2010); Nickerson D.W., Rogers T., “Political Campaigns and Big Data.”, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28, 2, pp. 51-73, (2014); Parti T., (2013); Pramuk J., (2016); Preimesberger C., (2016); Rutenberg J., (2013); Shen G., (2012); Siegel E., (2016); Cho T., Gimpel J.G., “Prospecting for (Campaign) Gold.”, American Journal of Political Science, 51, 2, pp. 255-268, (2007); Venkatesan R., Kumar V., “A Customer Lifetime Value Framework for Customer Selection and Resource Allocation Strategy.”, Journal of Marketing, 68, 4, pp. 106-125, (2004); Wagner J., (2016); Yu R., (2016)","D.

Nevertheless, the role of big data capabilities in fostering green marketing capabilities and improving green competitive advantage is still not fully understood. To add new knowledge, this paper aims to propose a moderated mediation model to strengthen green competitive advantage in a big data environment. The model introduces both the mediating role of green marketing capabilities and the moderating role of big data capabilities. We developed and empirically tested a moderated mediation model. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we have adopted a survey-based methodology. The study collected data from 337 managers and empirically analyzed it to test the theoretical model of moderated mediation. We employed structural equation modeling for empirical analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that organizational learning improves green marketing capabilities, whereas the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage is insignificant. The mediating role of green marketing capabilities in the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage was statistically significant, indicating that green marketing capabilities serve as a bridge between organizational learning and green competitive advantage. Big data capabilities moderate the relationship between organizational learning and green marketing capabilities. The moderated mediation was also significant, highlighting that big data capabilities further strengthen the indirect effects of organizational learning on green competitive advantage via green marketing capabilities. Originality/value: This paper delivers theoretical and practical understandings of the importance of organizational learning and big data capabilities. Similarly, it extends current knowledge and provides key insights for managerial decision-making. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Green competitive advantage; Green marketing capabilities; Organizational learning","","","","","","Social Science Fund Project of Jiangsu Province, (21EYB008)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Social Science Fund Project of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 21EYB008): The symbiosis pattern facing the \u201CBelt and Road\u201D in traditional industries of Jiangsu Province.","Alerasoul S.A., Afeltra G., Hakala H., Minelli E., Strozzi F., Organisational learning, learning organisation, and learning orientation: an integrative review and framework, Human Resource Management Review, 32, 3, (2022); Ali S., Peters L.D., He H.-W., Lettice F., Market based organisational learning, dynamic, and substantive capabilities: an integrative framework, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 18, 5, pp. 363-377, (2010); Amoako G.K., Dzogbenuku R.K., Doe J., Adjaison G.K., Green marketing and the SDGs: emerging market perspective, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 40, 3, pp. 310-327, (2022); Andronie M., Gardan D.A., Dumitru I., Gardan I.P., Andronie I.E., Uta C., Integrating the principles of green marketing by using big data.

However, core information systems classes for all business majors focus on improving information literacy but rarely include exercises with data visualization tools like Tableau. This study seeks to understand the perceptions business students have of Tableau after using it for several activities during a semester-long core business class. Specifically, the study examines the effects of gender, age, and major to understand how each factor affects student perceptions of Tableau including how easy it is to use, its value in the workplace, and how it compares to Excel. Tableau appealed to females just as much as males and to older students just as much as younger students. Tableau engaged with some majors more than others and appealed to CIS, Finance and Entrepreneurship majors more so than Marketing and Management majors (which include Management, Sport Management, Hospitality and Tourism, and Business Law). All majors saw the value of Tableau in workplaces for their future careers.

Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of existing BD literature in sport management outlines new perspectives on BD research method and the application of BD in sport management. Findings: First, through a thorough review of the literature, a domain-specific conceptualization that incorporates the field's mission and priorities was developed. Second, potential data sources and different types of analytical opportunities was identified, highlighting strategies for developing methodological approaches that leads to novel research questions. BD analytics can allow for more flexibility in improving methodological capability to analyze data and, thus, provide more granular and predictive insights. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion of BD's impact on three domains of sport management, whereby the organizations yield data-driven decisions. Originality/value: BD has the potential to transform the sport management operations and bridges the research-practice gap. BD research in sport management is instrumental for accumulating new knowledge and/or testing existing theories, either in a deductive fashion or by taking an inductive approach, as the field embarks to advance scholarship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytics; Big data; Big data analytics; Data-rich environments; Machine learning; Social media","","","","","","","","Alharthi A., Krotov V., Bowman M., Addressing barriers to big data, Business Horizons, 60, 3, pp. 285-292, (2017); The economist, (2021); Axtell C., Taylor M., Wessels B., Big Data and employee wellbeing: walking the tightrope between utopia and dystopia, Social Sciences, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, 8, 12, (2019); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W., Netzer O., Schweidel D., Uniting the tribes: using text for marketing insight, Journal of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical question for big data, Information, Communication and Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Brock V., Khan H., Big data analytics: does organizational factor matters impact technology acceptance?, Journal of Big Data, 4, 1, (2017); Buraimo B., Forrest D., McHale I.G., Tena J.D., Armchair fans: modelling audience size for televised football matches, European Journal of Operational Research, (2021); Burton N., Exploring user sentiment towards sponsorship and ambush marketing, International Journal of Sports Marketing and Sponsorship, 20, 4, pp. 583-602, (2019); Chang Y., Spectators' emotional responses in tweets during the Super Bowl 50 game, Sport Management Review, 22, 3, pp. 348-362, (2019); Delia E., ‘You can't just erase history': coping with team identity threat, Journal of Sport Management, 33, 3, pp. 203-214, (2019); DeSchriver T., Webb T., Tainsky S., Simion A., Sporting events and the derived demand for hotels: evidence from Southeastern Conference football games, Journal of Sport Management, 35, 3, pp. 228-238, (2021); Du J., McLeod C., Baker B., Gulavani S., James J., Churn Management for Season Ticket Holders Using Machine Learning, Presentation, (2021); Editorial R., The world's most-googled news stories of 2019 | Reuters Video, Mobile.reuters.com, (2021); Franks A., D'Amour A., Cervone D., Bornn L., Meta-analytics: tools for understanding the statistical properties of sports metrics, Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports, 12, 4, (2016); Fried G., Mumcu C., Sport Analytics: A Data-Driven Approach to Sport Business and Management, (2016); Funk D., James J., The Psychological Continuum Model: a conceptual framework for understanding an individual's psychological connection to sport, Sport Management Review, 4, 2, pp. 119-150, (2001); Funk D., Lock D., Karg A., Pritchard M., Sport consumer behavior research: improving our game, Journal of Sport Management, 30, 2, pp. 113-116, (2016); George G., Haas M., Pentland A., Big data and management, Academy of Management Journal, 57, 2, pp. 321-326, (2014); George G., Osinga E., Lavie D., Scott B., Big Data and data science methods for management research, Academy of Management Journal, 59, 5, pp. 1493-1507, (2016); Gong H., Watanabe N., Soebbing B., Brown M., Nagel M., Do consumer perceptions of tanking impact attendance at National Basketball Association games?

However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency. © 2024 The Authors","Aeronautics; Artificial Intelligence; Benefits; Performance; Use cases","Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Predictive analytics; Air France; Artificial intelligence technologies; Benefit; Conceptual maps; Dassault Aviation; Easyjet; Performance; Scientific literature; Sequential approach; Use case; Efficiency","","","","","","","Ahmed R., Shaheen S., Philbin S.P., The role of big data analytics and decision-making in achieving project success, J.

Cleansing, processing and analyzing of such large datasets create challenges for marketing organizations — particularly for real-time decision making and comparative implications. Importantly, there is limited research for such interplays. By utilizing a problematization approach, this paper contributes through the exploration of links between big data, programmatic marketing and real-time processing and relevant decision making for B2B industrial marketing organizations that depend on big data-driven marketing or big data-savvy managers. This exploration subsequently encompasses appropriate big data sources and effective batch and real-time processing linked with structured and unstructured datasets that influence relative processing techniques. Consequently, along with directions for future research, the paper develops interdisciplinary dialogues that overlay computer-engineering frameworks such as Apache Storm and Hadoop within B2B marketing viewpoints and their implications for contemporary marketing practices. © 2019","Batch processing;

The constant access to volume, variety, and veracity of data has made big data an integral part of management studies. New sub-management areas are emerging day by day with the support of big data to drive businesses. This study takes a systematic literature review approach to uncover the emerging management areas supported by big data in contemporary times. For this, we have analyzed the research papers published in the reputed management journals in the last ten years, fir using network analysis followed by natural language processing summarization techniques to find the emerging new management areas which are yet to get much attention. Furthermore, we ran the same exercise in each of these management areas to uncover these areas better. This research will act as a reference for future information systems (IS) scholars who want to perform analysis that is deep-dive in nature on each of these management areas, which in the coming times will get all the due attention to become dedicated research domains in the management area. We finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of future research in each of these management areas, which will be a true value addition for IS researchers. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data;

Further, customers have different thresholds of willingness to pay for sets of features. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and model the merging of supply chain strategies with the marketing decisions, which is key to the overall optimization of aspects of a firm’s strategy, including design of its products and their features, pricing, and positioning. The method used was to create the comprehensive modeling approach that represents these challenges not based on products, but based on individual features of those products, atomistically. The theoretical contribution made is the integration of supply chain optimization approaches, that are essentially based on the resource based view of the firm and focus on cost, with the marketing orientation approach to product design, pricing and marketing strategies. Further, this theoretical contribution recognises in its models that mass customization provides for individualization of features offered to each customer, at prices that reflect their assessed willingness to pay. There are many practical implications: many firms are moving towards full customization of feature sets, and increasingly pricing in a customized manner, and this trend will continue in practice as big data applications in markets go further and become more cost efficient. The integration of the marketing view and the resource-based operations view allows for a fully integrated view of competitive strategy and the design of products and services, so that firms can profit optimize their offerings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Business strategy; Marketing management; Micro-strategy; Modeling business strategies; Operations management; Operations marketing integration; Optimisation; Product features; Recource based view; Strategic integration; Supply chain management","","","","","","","","Adner R., Csaszar F.A., Zemsky P.B., Positioning on a Multiattribute Landscape, Manag Sci, 60, 11, pp. 2794-2815, (2014); Bacon G., Beckman S., Mowery D., Wilson E., Managing product definition in high-technology industries: A pilot study, Calif Manage Rev, 36, 3, pp. 32-56, (1994); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, J Manag, 5, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J.B., Bold voices and new opportunities: An expanded research agenda for the resource-based view, J Manag, (2021); Bunge M., The critical approach to science and philosophy: Essays in honor of Karl R.

We study two related perspectives with regard to what people talk about online and what they intend to do in the adoption phase to offer advice to companies aiming to excel in online marketing efforts. Drawing on the consumption value theory, we examine buyers’ discussions about and intention to use wearable devices for a sample of consumers in Taiwan. A framework is advanced to explore the results of big data analysis employing text-mining techniques (i.e., what people talk about) and survey-based research using structural equation modelling (i.e., what people intend to do). Functional, emotional and conditional values surfaced as the highest Internet buzzes of wearable devices. Conversely, emotional, epistemic and functional values emerged as the most influential drivers of customers’ adoption intention. Our findings suggest that different value dimensions are relevant at different points of the purchase-related decision-making process. Some values animate Internet discussions that pertain to the pre-purchase information search stage, and others appear significant during the formation of people’s purchase intentions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and provide suggestions for future research. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Eurasia Business and Economics Society.","Big data; Consumption value theory; Electronic word-of-mouth; Online consumer behavior; Text mining; Wearable devices","","","","","","","","Alghizzawi M., A survey of the role of social media platforms in viral marketing: The influence of e-WoM, International Journal of Information Technology, 3, 2, pp. 54-60, (2019); Bai X., Predicting consumer sentiments from online text, Decision Support Systems, 50, 4, pp. 732-742, (2011); Banfield R., Eriksson M., Walkingshaw N., Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and Build Successful Teams, (2017); Barlow J., Maul D., Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers, (2000); Bodolica V., Kasih B., Reimagining the post-pandemic industry of arts in the Arab world: Fast-tracked digital uplift or back to business as usual?, Emerald Emerging Markets Case Studies, 11, 3, pp. 1-11, (2021); Bodolica V., Spraggon M., An end-to-end process of writing and publishing influential literature review articles: Do’s and don’ts, Management Decision, 56, 11, pp. 2472-2486, (2018); Bodolica V., Spraggon M., Abou Soueid M., Innovation drivers and trends in the retail industry: An application to emerging markets and the case of the Gulf region, International Journal of Comparative Management, 2, 1, pp. 51-66, (2019); Bodolica V., Spraggon M., Khaddage-Soboh N., Air-travel services industry in the post-COVID-19: The GPS (Guard-Potentiate-Shape) model for crisis navigation, Tourism Review, 76, 4, pp. 942-961, (2021); Bronner F., De Hoog R., Comparing conspicuous consumption across different experiential products: Culture and leisure, International Journal of Market Research, 61, 4, pp. 430-446, (2019); Chang H.S., Lee S.C., Ji Y.G., Wearable device adoption model with TAM and TTF, International Journal of Mobile Communications, 14, 5, pp. 518-537, (2016); Chen K.J., You J.M., A study on word similarity using context vector models, International Journal of Computational Linguistics & Chinese Language Processing, 7, 2, pp. 37-58, (2002); Chen Y.C., Shang R.A., Lin A.K., The intention to download music files in a P2P environment: Consumption value, fashion, and ethical decision perspectives, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7, 4, pp. 411-422, (2008); Cheng J.M.S., Wang E.S.T., Lin J.Y.C., Vivek S.D., Why do customers utilize the internet as a retailing platform?

Manouba, ESEN, Tunisia","With the rise of social media platforms for marketing purposes, the central dilemma for researchers and policymakers lies in choosing effective data analysis tools to improve marketing decisions. In the academic literature, numerous articles have discussed clustering techniques for analysing social media data, from a perspective of data mining or social media marketing. However, few studies have attempted to synthesise results obtained from both perspectives. This research aims to (1) offer a structured overview of existing literature on clustering methods for marketing strategies and (2) compare three topic modelling techniques applied to extract the main topics evoked in the corpus of papers. Indeed, topic modelling emerges as a valuable tool for extracting relevant information from big data in general and more specifically from extensive scientific papers. Based on a thematic analysis, the extracted topics were classified according to the following categories: fields, marketing strategies and technologies. Results prove that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most effective technique in this context. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of clustering techniques and technologies used for marketing strategies in studied fields. These findings help researchers and practitioners to select the best techniques and technologies for extracting marketing knowledge from big data. © 2024 Telecommunications Association Inc..

However, the attributes for enabling practice between such technological interfaces with managerial adoption are been lagging creating a knowledge gap. To address this, present research surveys the prior work from 1970 to 2020 on intelligent decision support models specific to banking. Subsequently, findings are synthesized on quadrant outcomes; technology; employees, customers, and organizations for service ecosystems. In addition, the managerial perceptions of technology on work are captured through short survey. Finally, scope of advancements like big data, internet of things (IoT), virtual reality (VR) along other untapped conceptual relationships into this framework are discussed. © 2021 The Authors","Banking; Bibliometrics; Decision support systems; Emerging markets; Systematic review","","","","","","","","Adapa S., Roy S.K., Consumers’ post-adoption behaviour towards Internet banking: Empirical evidence from Australia, Behaviour & Information Technology, 36, 9, pp. 970-983, (2017); Adikari A., Burnett D., Sedera D., de Silva D., Alahakoon D., Value co-creation for open innovation: An evidence-based study of the data driven paradigm of social media using machine learning, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 1, 2, (2021); Agrawal V., Seth N., Dixit J.K., A combined AHP–TOPSIS–DEMATEL approach for evaluating success factors of e-service quality: An experience from Indian banking industry, Electronic Commerce Research, pp. 1-33, (2020); Aladwani A.M., Online banking: A field study of drivers, development challenges, and expectations, International journal of information management, 21, 3, pp. 213-225, (2001); Alalwan A.A., Dwivedi Y.K., Rana N.P., Williams M.D., Consumer adoption of mobile banking in Jordan, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 29, 1, (2016); Ali O.G., Akcay Y., Sayman S., Yilmaz E., Ozcelik M.H., Cross-selling investment products with a win-win perspective in portfolio optimization, Operations Research, 65, 1, pp. 55-74, (2017); Anand S.S., Patrick A.R., Hughes J.G., Bell D.A., A data mining methodology for cross-sales, Knowledge-Based Systems, 10, 7, pp. 449-461, (1998); Arjun R., Suprabha K.R., Innovation and Challenges of Blockchain in Banking: A Scientometric View, International Journal of Interactive Multimedia & Artificial Intelligence, 6, 3, (2020); Azadeh A., Saberi M., Jiryaei Z., An intelligent decision support system for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel attributes in a large bank, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 16, pp. 12358-12370, (2012); Baabdullah A.M., Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Kizgin H., Patil P., Consumer use of mobile banking (M-Banking) in Saudi Arabia: Towards an integrated model, International Journal of Information Management, 44, pp. 38-52, (2019); Baabdullah A.M., Rana N.P., Alalwan A.A., Islam R., Patil P., Dwivedi Y.K., Consumer adoption of self-service technologies in the context of the Jordanian banking industry: Examining the moderating role of channel types, Information Systems Management, 36, 4, pp. 286-305, (2019); Bach M.P., Jukovic S., Dumicic K., Sarlija N., Business client segmentation in banking using self-organizing maps, South East European Journal of Economics and Business, 8, 2, pp. 32-41, (2014); Basias N., Themistocleous M., Morabito V., SOA adoption in e-banking, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 26, 6, pp. 719-739, (2013); Bitner M.J., Brown S.W., Meuter M.L., Technology infusion in service encounters, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 138-149, (2000); Bose R., Customer relationship management: Key components for I.T. success, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 102, 2, pp. 89-97, (2002); Broadbent M., Weill P., Improving business and information strategy alignment: Learning from the banking industry, IBM systems Journal, 32, 1, pp. 162-179, (1993); Cho J., Park I., Michel J.W., How does leadership affect information systems success?

However, the widening trend of digital behaviors of think tanks in the social media era is yet to be investigated. While social media is reshaping the political ecology and challenging conventional sources of knowledge, it also serves as a potential channel for think tanks to publicly share their expertise and policy advice with the public and decision-makers, thus evolving into “digital advocators.” Based on social media big data methods, this paper has constructed two sets of new think tank indicators with “network centrality” of social media accounts and “ripple effect” of social media citations from Facebook and Twitter to capture and observe the digital activities of 207 prominent think tanks in 62 countries or regions. We have concluded that think tanks have displayed their opinion and values and increased visibility as digital advocators by spreading expertise on social media platforms with online marketing skills. With various values and ideas, social media not only is hosting massive policy advocacy activities and being an expertise spreading arena for think tanks but has also been changing the ecology of the think tank industry and expertise markets. © The Author(s) 2023.

Specifically, those students who are majoring in supply chain would benefit the most from this case study. This case study has elements of supply chain management, supply chain strategy, warehousing and logistics, and a digital supply chain for Industry 4.0. The learning outcome of this case study could be seen if the students are able to identify the challenges and opportunities of a digital supply chain for Industry 4.0 and how it could be implemented methodically. Teaching Objective 1: Students should be able to identify what challenges organizations face if they implement a digital supply chain for Industry 4.0. Teaching Objective 2: Students should be able to identify what opportunities can be tapped if Big Data Analytics are used in a supply chain teaching. Objective 3: Students should layout a methodical plan of how an analogue company can gradually achieve the objective of implementing a digital supply chain for Industry 4.0 in procurement function. Case overview/Synopsis: Based in the Lahore region of Pakistan, Xarasoft is a footwear manufacturing company which has undertaken a decision to transcend to a digital supply chain for Industry 4.0 by 2027. Asif, who is the Head of the Department of Supply Chain, has to come up with a plan to present in the next meeting with the CEO. Xarasoft is a company that preferred to work in an analogue routine. The company set production targets and sold goods through marketing. With no forecast or exact demand, the company had decided to procure 140 million units of raw material and carrying a huge inventory, a percentage of which had to be thrown away as it started to degrade. While the company did have machinery on the production floor, they were operated manually and were a generation behind. Asif faced the question of what challenges he would face and exactly how would a digital supply chain for Industry 4.0 be implemented in the company.

Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades. The authors then use the components of the model for marketing decisions such as forecasting the success of new albums, conducting album tuning and diagnostics, constructing playlists for different generations of music listeners, and providing contextual recommendations. © American Marketing Association 2021.","Bayesian nonparametrics; big data; data fusion; multimedia; music industry; product recommendations; supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process","","","","","","W.

However, the abundance of user-generated content data makes it challenging to analyze and derive insights from it. As a result, the demand for sentiment analysis research has increased. This work intends to highlight the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis through a bibliometric analysis. To our knowledge, bibliometric research of sentiment analysis on user-generated content has never been conducted. The research methodology adopted for this study was essentially divided into four phases. Those phases include data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis and report writing. This bibliometric research successfully identified the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis. This study will give a baseline for future researchers to start another study. Big data, text analytics, text mining, tourism, covid-19, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, making predictions, and marketing decisions are among the most recent research interests for sentiment analysis of user-generated content. However, there is a lack of research on those particular topics. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

The past decade has witnessed an increased use of user-generated content (UGC) analysis as a marketing tool to make better informed decisions. Likewise, textual data analysis of UGC has gained much attention among tourism and hospitality scholars. Nonetheless, most of the scholarly works have focused on the singular application of an existing method or technique rather than using a multi-method approach. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel Web analytics methodology to examine online reviews posted by tourists in real time and assist decision-makers tasked with marketing strategy and intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: For illustration, the case of tourism campaign in India was undertaken. A total of 305,298 reviews were collected, and after filtering, 276,154 reviews were qualified for analysis using a string of models. Descriptive charts, sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling and machine learning algorithms for real-time classification were applied. Findings: Using big data from TripAdvisor, a total of 145 tourist destinations were clustered based on tourists’ perceptions. Further exploration of each cluster through topic modeling was conducted, which revealed interesting insights into satisfiers and dissatisfiers of different clusters of destinations. The results supported the use of the proposed multi-method Web-analytics approach. Practical implications: The proposed machine learning model demonstrated that it could provide real-time information on the sentiments in each incoming review about a destination. This information might be useful for taking timely action for improvisation or controlling a service situation. Originality/value: In terms of Web-analytics and UGC, a comprehensive analytical model to perform an end-to-end understanding of tourist behavior patterns and offer the potential for real-time interpretation is rarely proposed. The current study not only proposes such a model but also offers empirical evidence for a successful application. It contributes to the literature by providing scholars interested in textual analytics a step-by-step guide to implement a multi-method approach. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","India; Text analytics; Tourism; User-generated content","","","","","","","","Alaei A.R., Becken S., Stantic B., Sentiment analysis in tourism: capitalizing on big data, Journal of Travel Research, 58, 2, pp. 175-191, (2019); Ali F., Park E., Kwon J., Chae B., 30 years of contemporary hospitality management: uncovering the bibliometrics and topical trends, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 7, pp. 2641-2665, (2019); Amaro S., Duarte P., Henriques C., Travelers’ use of social media: a clustering approach, Annals of Tourism Research, 59, pp. 1-15, (2016); Anagnostopoulou S.C., Buhalis D., Kountouri I.L., Manousakis E.G., Tsekrekos A.E., The impact of online reputation on hotel profitability, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 32, 1, pp. 20-39, (2020); Baker M.A., Kim K., Value destruction in exaggerated online reviews: the effects of emotion, language, and trustworthiness, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 4, pp. 1956-1976, (2019); Banerjee S., Chua A.Y., In search of patterns among travellers' hotel ratings in TripAdvisor, Tourism Management, 53, pp. 125-131, (2016); Calheiros A.C., Moro S., Rita P., Sentiment classification of consumer-generated online reviews using topic modelling, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 26, 7, pp. 675-693, (2017); Chakraborty U., Perceived credibility of online hotel reviews and its impact on hotel booking intentions, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 9, pp. 3465-3483, (2019); Chang Y.C., Ku C.H., Chen C.H., Social media analytics: extracting and visualizing Hilton Hotel ratings and reviews from TripAdvisor, International Journal of Information Management, 48, pp. 263-279, (2019); Chang Y.C., Ku C.H., Chen C.H., Using deep learning and visual analytics to explore hotel reviews and responses, Tourism Management, 80, (2020); Choi Y., Hickerson B., Kerstetter D., Understanding the sources of online travel information, Journal of Travel Research, 57, 1, pp. 116-128, (2018); Chu S.-C., Deng T., Cheng H., The role of social media advertising in hospitality, tourism and travel: a literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 32, 11, (2020); Claveria Gonzalez O., Poluzzi A., Positioning and clustering of the world's top tourist destinations by means of dimensionality reduction techniques for categorical data, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 6, 1, pp. 22-32, (2017); Dayour F., Park S., Kimbu A., Backpackers’ perceived risks towards smartphone usage and risk reduction strategies: a mixed methods study, Tourism Management, 72, pp. 52-68, (2019); Dickinger A., Lalicic L., Mazanec J., Exploring the generalizability of discriminant word items and latent topics in online tourist reviews, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 29, 2, pp. 803-816, (2017); Farquad M.A.H., Ravi V., Raju S.B., Churn prediction using comprehensible support vector machine: an analytical CRM application, Applied Soft Computing, 19, pp. 31-40, (2014); Filieri R., Alguezaui S., McLeay F., Why do travelers trust TripAdvisor?

This paper applies game theory to study the decisions and coordination issues of a green supply chain in which the online retailer conducts big data targeted advertising. A centralized model and two Stackelberg game models (an online-retailer-led decentralized model and a manufacturer-led decentralized model) were constructed and solved. The zero wholesale price-side-payment contract and greedy wholesale price-side-payment contract were introduced into the green supply chain for coordination. The study found that: (1) the increase in demand attenuation coefficient, green sensitivity coefficient, and big data targeted advertising sensitivity coefficient will be beneficial to the growth of total consumer demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit; (2) supply chain coordination is necessary because greenness, demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit under the centralized model are higher than those under two decentralized models; (3) two contracts can achieve the coordination of the green supply chain, and the profits of the manufacturer and online retailer under the contract are greater than those under the decentralized model. The results can provide insights for promoting green supply chain operations. © 2022 by the authors.","big data targeted advertising; coordination; green supply chain; greenness; online retailer; optimal decisions","","","","","","Hebei Provincial Postgraduate Demonstration Course Construction Project, (KCJSX2021021); Soft Science Research Project of Innovation Competence Enhancement Plan of Hebei Province, (21552501D, BJ2021079); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71704151)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71704151; the Soft Science Research Project of Innovation Competence Enhancement Plan of Hebei Province, grant number 21552501D; the Young Top Talent Project of Hebei Higher Education Institutions Humanities and Social Science Research Project, grant number BJ2021079; and the 2021 Hebei Provincial Postgraduate Demonstration Course Construction Project, grant number KCJSX2021021.","Gao J., Xiao Z., Cao B., Chai Q., Green supply chain planning considering consumer’s transportation process, Transport.

In the era of the digital data age, actions carried out through libraries can be traced and analyzed to monitor the demand for library services. This study presents the development and utilization of Korea's National Library Big Data Platform (NLBDP), which was constructed to collect operational data from public libraries in the country and to build national open data platform for the participating libraries and for public use. This study analyzed 17 application cases that utilized NLBDP in order to understand the way the platform has been used. The findings showed that the types of data analyzed so far have been somewhat limited. It suggests needs for further enhancing the data quality and for diversifying data sources, such as individual local library operational data, surveys, demographics, news, and social media. The results also revealed that NLBDP has been utilized for seven distinct purposes: library operations and strategic planning; social trend analysis; collection management; redesigning library space; recruiting new patrons; library marketing; and non-library applications. Building an infrastructure for networked data analysis not only enables evidence-based decision-making in public libraries, but also extracts timely topics that can be developed as useful services for their community. The findings of this study highlighted the necessity to formulate national library data policies and gather data capable of measuring the social impact of libraries. © (2023).

Gathering data from two different sources, Flickr and Twitter, textual and visual contents are used to perform different analytics tasks to generate insights on tourist behaviour and the affective aspects of the destination image. Design/methodology/approach: This work adopts a method based on a multimodal approach on BSD and analytics, considering multiple BSD sources, different analytics techniques on heterogeneous data types, to obtain complementary results on the Salento region (Italy) case study. Findings: Results show that the generated insights allow DMOs to acquire new knowledge about discovery of unknown clusters of points of interest, identify trends and seasonal patterns of tourist demand, monitor topic and sentiment and identify attractive places. DMOs can exploit insights to address its needs in terms of decision support for the management and development of the destination, the enhancement of destination attractiveness, the shaping of new marketing and communication strategies and the planning of tourist demand within the destination. Originality/value: The originality of this work is in the use of BSD and analytics techniques for giving DMOs specific insights on a destination in a deep and wide fashion. Collected data are used with a multimodal analytic approach to build tourist characteristics, images, attitudes and preferred destination attributes, which represent for DMOs a unique mean for problem-solving, decision-making, innovation and prediction. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data analytics; Big data analytics; DMO; Tourism destination management; Tourist behaviour","","","","","","Albania; NEST","The approach described in this paper is adopted in the NEST (Networking for smart tourism development, INTERREG-IPA CBC Italia-Albania-Montenegro – Project n. 96-1· call for standard project – co-financed by the European Union under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II)) project, which aims at enabling a cross-border cooperation between Albania, Italy and Montenegro, in order to create a common branding of the Adriatic-Ionian area as a smart tourism destination at a macro regional level and to develop common tourist routes and products.","Alvarez M.D., Campo S., The influence of political conflicts on country image and intention to visit: a study of Israel's image, Tourism Management, 40, pp. 70-78, (2014); Ammirato S., Felicetti A.M., Della Gala M., Raso C., Cozza M., Smart tourism destinations: can the destination management organizations exploit benefits of the ICTs?

An unweighted index number is employed to measure the average variation for searches and picks, for the year 2020, in relation to the reference base period (year 2019). This is done for air travel in general and to Spain specifically. The study then proceeds to conduct an analysis of 17 international travel destinations that are in the evoked sets of the two largest outbound markets in Europe (Germany and UK). We also identify which markets are most favourable to Spain. The research design can inform cost-efficient marketing decisions in a situation of high uncertainty. © 2022","Anxiety; Big data; COVID-19; Europe; Evoked set; Flights; Risk","","","","","","","","Abougomaah N.H., Schlacter J.L., Gaidis W., Elimination and choice phases in evoked set formation, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 4, 4, pp. 67-72, (1987); Blake A., Sinclair M.T., Sugiyarto G., Quantifying the impact of foot and mouth disease on tourism and the UK economy, Tourism Economics, 9, 4, pp. 449-465, (2003); Champion V.L., Skinner C.S., “The health belief model”, health behavior and health education: Theory, research, and practice, pp. 45-65, (2008); Chen S., Law R., Zhang M., Review of research on tourism-related diseases, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 26, 1, pp. 44-58, (2021); Chua B.L., Al-Ansi A., Lee M.J., Han H., Impact of health risk perception on avoidance of international travel in the wake of a pandemic, Current Issues in Tourism, pp. 1-18, (2020); Cooper M., Japanese tourism and the SARS epidemic of 2003, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 19, 2-3, pp. 117-131, (2006); Crompton J., Structure of vacation destination choice sets, Annals of Tourism Research, 19, 3, pp. 420-434, (1992); Decrop A., Destination choice sets: An inductive longitudinal approach, Annals of Tourism Research, 37, 1, pp. 93-115, (2010); Dellaert B.G., Arentze T.A., Horeni O., Tourists’ mental representations of complex travel decision problems, Journal of Travel Research, 53, 1, pp. 3-11, (2014); El Alaoui I., Gahi Y., Messoussi R., Todoskoff A., Kobi A., Big data analytics: A comparison of tools and applications, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the Mediterranean Symposium on Smart City Applications, (2017); Floyd D.L., Prentice-Dunn S., Rogers R.W., A meta-analysis of research on protection motivation theory, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 30, 2, pp. 407-429, (2000); ForwardKeys, ForwardKeys, (2020); Frisch R., Annual survey of general economic theory: The problem of index numbers, Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 4, 1, pp. 1-38, (1936); Gallego I., Font X., Changes in air passenger demand as a result of the COVID-19 crisis: Using big data to inform tourism policy, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, pp. 1-20, (2020); Gandomi A., Haider M., Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics, International Journal of Information Management, 35, 2, pp. 137-144, (2015); Gobierno de Espana, Plan de impulso para el sector turístico, (2020); Graham A., Kremarik F., Kruse W., Attitudes of ageing passengers to air travel since the coronavirus pandemic, Journal of Air Transport Management, 87, (2020); Gudykunst W., Hammer M., Strangers and hosts: An uncertainty reduction base theory of intercultural adaptation, Cross cultural adaptation: Current approaches, pp. 106-139, (1988); Herzberg F., Mausnes B., Peterson R.O., Capwell D.F., Job attitudes; review of research and opinion, (1957); Hofstede G., Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions, and organizations across nations, (2001); Howard J., Sheth J., The theory of buyer behavior, (1969); Howard J.A., Marketing management: Analysis and planning, (1963); Huang X., Dai S., Xu H., Predicting tourists' health risk preventative behaviour and travelling satisfaction in Tibet: Combining the theory of planned behaviour and health belief model, Tourism Management Perspectives, 33, (2020); INE.

Nonetheless, the determinants or consequences of its adoption in small and medium enterprises remain unclear, hence the objective of this study. Data analysis of 171 Iranian small and medium manufacturing firms revealed that complexity, uncertainty and insecurity, trialability, observability, top management support, organizational readiness, and external support affect significantly on BDA adoption. The findings confirm the strong impact of BDA adoption in small to medium-sized enterprises, marketing and financial, performance enhancement. Understanding the drivers of BDA adoption helps managers to employ appropriate initiatives that are vital for effective implementation. The results enable BDA service providers to attract and diffuse BDA in small to medium-sized enterprises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics adoption; Firm performance; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Technological-organizational-environmental model","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Decision making; Uncertainty analysis; Industrial environments; Manufacturing firms; Optimal performance; Organizational readiness; Performance enhancements; Small and medium enterprise; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Top management support; Data Analytics","","","","","","","Aboelmaged M.G., The drivers of sustainable manufacturing practices in Egyptian SMEs and their impact on competitive capabilities: A PLS-SEM model, Journal of Cleaner Production, 175, pp. 207-221, (2018); Acharya A., Singh S.K., Pereira V., Singh P., Big data, knowledge co-creation and decision making in fashion industry, International Journal of Information Management, 42, pp. 90-101, (2018); Agrawal K., Investigating the determinants of Big Data Analytics (BDA) adoption in Asian emerging economies, Proceedings of the Twenty-First Information Systems, Puerto Richo, August, pp. 13-15, (2015); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

Using a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis, we examined a sample of 98 studies indexed in SCOPUS to identify research activity on this topic until May 2023. Data-driven marketing and communications have gained popularity as companies and marketers prioritize leveraging consumer and market data to strategize and make informed decisions. Adopting and integrating various technologies into the company's systems is crucial for companies aiming to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. By analyzing and interpreting customer data, companies can implement customer-centered marketing initiatives that enhance their experience and satisfaction with the brand, thus strengthening company-customer relationships. However, data-driven marketing faces several challenges, including consumer privacy concerns, data poisoning, information quality issues, and the need for adequate organizational changes. © 2023","Big data; Customer data; Customer relationship management; Data-driven; Marketing","","","","","","Universidade de Aveiro, UA; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/04005/2020, UIDB/04058/2020, UIDP/04058/2020)","Funding text 1: The first author receives financial support from Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (through projects UIDB/04058/2020 and UIDP/04058/2020 ), and the second author receives financial support from Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (through project UIDB/04005/2020 ). ; Funding text 2: We would like to express our gratitude to the editor and the referees.

This topic has long gone beyond the information sphere, as it now applies to almost every sphere of life: economic, telecommunications, education, medicine, administration, and especially defense. Predicting customer behavior based on scoring models is in its infancy in Ukrainian companies, the main ones being the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning, which will be the leading catalyst that will facilitate decision-making in business in the nearest future. The aim of the study is to develop a scoring model that predicts the behavior of target segments, namely, updating their activity to activate advertising tools. To achieve the goal of the work a set of research methods was used: dialectical-to reveal the theoretical foundations of models and types of forecasting models; analytical-in the study of the functioning of the environment SAS, Anaconda; optimization methods-to choose the best model and generate features. Scientific novelty and theoretical significance lie in the development of a scoring model for predicting the activity of subscribers of the telecommunications company ""VF Ukraine"", on the basis of which marketing campaigns are conducted. With the help of the built-in scoring model, the company ""VF Ukraine""can target its campaigns to retain subscribers. The marketing directorate of the enterprise can choose the TOP-20 or TOP-30 of the most prone subscribers to non-resumption of activity, i.e., tend to switch to other mobile operators, and hold promotions for them-providing additional gifts and bonuses, money to mobile account.  © 2022 Tetiana Zatonatska et al., published by Sciendo.","advertising; big data; market segment; scoring models; target; telecommunication sector","","","","","","","","Airola A., Pahikkala T., Waegeman W., De Baets B., Salakoski T., An experimental comparison of cross-validation techniques for estimating the area under the ROC-curve, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 55, 4, pp. 1828-1844, (2011); Celisse A., Optimal cross-validation in density estimation with the L<sup>2</sup>-loss, The Annals of Statistics, 42, 5, pp. 1879-1910, (2014); Dai D., Identifying dissatisfied 4G customers from network indicators: A comparison between complaint and survey data, Big Data Applications in the Telecommunications Industry, pp. 41-53, (2017); Dang Ch, Network-based targeting: Big Data application in mobile industry, Big Data Applications in the Telecommunications Industry, pp. 78-107, (2017); Deroos D., Zikopoulos P.C., Melnyk R.B., Brown B., Coss R., Hadoop for dummies, (2014); Dluhopolskyi O., Simakhova A., Zatonatska T., Oleksiv I., Kozlovskyi S., Potential of virtual reality in the current digital society: economic perspectives, 11th International Conference on Advanced Computer Information Technologies, (2021); pp. 360-363; Fawcett T., An introduction to ROC analysis, Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 8, pp. 861-874, (2006); Goworek D., The big impact of Big Data on the telecom industry, (2021); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., Elements of Statistical Learning: data mining, inference, and prediction, (2017); Hssina B., Merbouha A., Ezzikouri H., Erritali M., A comparative study of decision tree ID3 and C4.5, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), Special Issue on Advances in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networking and Applications, pp. 13-19, (2014); Kuhn M., Johnson K., Applied Predictive Modeling, (2013); Lurie A., 39 Data Visualization Tools for Big Data, (2014); Discover Feature Engineering, How to Engineer Features and How to Get Good at It, (2015); McLachlan G.J., Do K.-A., Ambroise C., Analyzing microarray gene expression data, (2004); Molinaro A.M., Simon R., Pfeiffer R.M., Prediction error estimation: A comparison of resampling methods, Bioinformatics, 21, 15, pp. 3301-3307, (2005); Mykhalchuk T., Zatonatska T., Dluhopolskyi O., Zhukovska A., Dluhopolska T., Liakhovych L., Development of recommendation system in e-commerce using emotional analysis and machine learning methods, The 11th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications (IDAACS), 1, pp. 527-535, (2021); Perkhofer L., Walchshofer C., Hofer P., Does design matter when visualizing Big Data?

Cryptocurrency wallet applications could deploy affiliate marketing processes to increase the visibility of their products. From these affiliate marketing processes, supply chain firms in the air forwarding sector that seek to advertise their services to a larger audience could be benefited. This research examines whether affiliate marketing initials of cryptocurrency wallet applications affect their digital marketing efficiency, as well as whether air forwarding firms’ website visibility could be benefited from them. After collecting the required Web Analytic data, the authors performed statistical analysis (correlations and linear regressions), followed by Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) macroanalysis and Hybrid Modeling (HM) microanalysis to assess the outcomes of cryptocurrency wallet applications’ affiliate marketing programs. Hence, from the deployed methodology, valuable insights arose. The first part of the produced outcomes concerns the effect of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics on their digital marketing results. The increased implications of affiliate marketing metrics (referring domains, backlinks, etc.) decrease the number of pages their visitors see. Regarding the air forwarder firms’ website visibility, specific metrics (branded and referral traffic) were increased and others (social traffic) were decreased from the increment of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics (backlinks, internal links, etc.). Supply chain firms, in the air forwarding sector, could have increased website visibility by deploying advertisements and affiliate marketing initiatives with cryptocurrency wallet organizations. Summing up, specific affiliate marketing metrics of cryptocurrency wallet applications are capable of significantly impacting their digital marketing performance and also constitute determinant factors of supply chain firms’ website visibility. © 2023 by the authors.","big data; blockchain; Decision Support Systems (DSSs); digitalization; innovation; process optimization; strategic digital marketing; supply chain; sustainability","decision support system; digitization; general process or activity; innovation; market system; marketing; statistical analysis; supply chain management; sustainability","","","","","European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","The authors acknowledge the support of this work by the project “Smart Agriculture and Circular Bio-Economy—SmartBIC.” (MIS MIS5047106), which was implemented under the Action “Reinforcement of the Research and Innovation Infrastructure”, funded by the Operational Programme “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation” (NSRF 2014–2020) co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund).

A health-food mainly includes organic food, natural and non-GMO foods, special foods for allergic people like gluten-free, lactose-free and dairy-free products and low fat-high protein keto diet products such as beans, legumes, nuts and seeds. Food consumption patterns of ‘health-foods’ and their preferences are constantly changing all over the world, due to change in urban-lifestyle patterns leading to high stress, anxiety and health related diseases like diabetes and obesity etc. In today’s era “Eating healthy and living healthy” is a most suitable mantra for living a good life. According to the global health and wellness food market report, it is expected that during 2020-2024, the size of the health and wellness food market is likely to rise by US$ 235.94, advancing at a CAGR of 6 percent. Organic and gluten-free foods are considered to be on top when talking about the health-foods. There is need to further explore the mindset of consumers regarding health-foods and their consumption, since its benefits looks promising but very little is known about the consumers’ beliefs, motivations and values driving their decision in making the purchase of these foods. Various researches indicates that a better understanding of consumers' perception of health foods are the main factors for market positioning, growth and for negotiating market opportunities. Main objective of the paper is to understand the perception of consumer using Big Data analysis so as to assist health food manufacturers to improve food products according to customer choices and preferences. In this study, by using social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, posts, and reviews that have played a major role in increased sales of health foods, we will primarily concentrate on understanding the public perception regarding organic and gluten-free foods. The study will also provide in-depth insights about health-foods in form of positive, negative and neutral sentiments of the consumers using the social media data from Talkwalker and Google Trends. This research would help organic food and glutenfree food manufacturers to understand the consumer perception and to improve marketing return on investment. The results of the study discussed the 'most talked about' and anticipated product innovation in health-food sectors such as new snacks, fast food (pizza, pasta and noodles) and desserts. The study is unique since it combines big data to the niche market of health foods to draw the valuable consumer preferences using online platforms. © 2021, Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences.

Then, differential game theory is used to model and derive the objective functions and equilibrium strategies of the FDSSC members in four scenarios: decentralization, independent delivery, independent production, and centralization. The effects of cooperation patterns among the FDSSC members, consumer channel preferences, commission rates, and food delivery fees of the food delivery platform on the optimal decision-making and performance of the FDSSC members are discussed. Through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis of essential parameters, we summarize the following conclusions. First, whether it is independent production and independent delivery, any cooperation between the FDSSC members is always beneficial for the profit improvement of all FDSSC members. Therefore, the restaurant, food delivery platform, and rider should actively seek pairwise or tripartite cooperation to achieve common profit enhancement. In addition, when the online channel preference of consumers increases, the restaurant should continuously enhance the food quality and catering service level to ensure an amazing dining experience for consumers, which is conducive to the formation of a healthy dual-channel food sales model. Last, a higher commission rate can increase the profits of the food delivery platform and the whole FDSSC, but it damages the revenue of the restaurant, while a higher food delivery fee can bring more profits to the restaurant and rider. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Big data marketing; Food delivery platform; Food delivery service; Food supply chain; Pricing","centralization; decentralization; food market; marketing; model test; price determination; profitability; service sector; supply chain management; transportation system","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72171047, 12201318, 72301147); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (63232176)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72171047, 12201318, and 72301147), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 63232176).","Anbumathi R., Dorai S., Palaniappan U., Evaluating the role of technology and non-technology factors influencing brand love in online food delivery services, J.

For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10–20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape. A traffic light dashboard for domestic and inbound air travel demand to Spain shows how destination managers might use Big Data relating to the early recovery of key source markets to develop targeted marketing strategies. We show how Big Data provides timely granular data essential in highly volatile situations, and we argue that destination management organisations must improve their Big Data analytical and evidence-based, decision-making skills. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Big Data; COVID-19; forecast; impact; risk; tourism","Europe; air transportation; COVID-19; data set; decision making; forecasting method; health impact; health risk; tourism development; tourism management; tourist behavior; travel demand","","","","","","","Anzai A., Kobayashi T., Linton N.M., Kinoshita R., Hayashi K., Suzuki A., Yang Y., Jung S.-M., Miyama T., Akhmetzhanov A.R., Nishiura H., Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9, 2, (2020); Batista e Silva F., Herrera M.A.M., Rosina K., Barranco R.R., Freire S., Schiavina M., Analysing spatiotemporal patterns of tourism in Europe at high-resolution with conventional and big data sources, Tourism Management, 68, pp. 101-115, (2018); Bauler T., An analytical framework to discuss the usability of (environmental) indicators for policy, Ecological Indicators, 17, pp. 38-45, (2012); Bowen S., Zwi A.B., Pathways to “evidence-informed” policy and practice: a framework for action, PLoS Medicine, 2, 7, (2005); Chevalier S., Choiniere R., Bernier L., Sauvageau Y., Masson I., Cadieux E., User guide to 40 community health indicators, (1992); Chinazzi M., Davis J.T., Ajelli M., Gioannini C., Litvinova M., Merler S., Sun K., The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, Science, 368, 6489, pp. 395-400, (2020); Chung L.H., Impact of pandemic control over airport economics: Reconciling public health with airport business through a streamlined approach in pandemic control, Journal of Air Transport Management, 44-45, pp. 42-53, (2015); Cro S., Martins A.M., Structural breaks in international tourism demand: Are they caused by crises or disasters?, Tourism Management, 63, pp. 3-9, (2017); Demunter C., Tourism statistics.

Content preferences are defined over latent topics that describe the content of search queries and search result descriptions. Compared with existing applications of topic modeling in marketing and recommendation systems, our proposed approach can simultaneously capture multiple types of information and investigate multiple aspects of behavioral dynamics in a single framework that enables interpretable results for business decision making. To facilitate efficient and scalable inference, we develop a full Bayesian variational inference algorithm. We evaluate our modeling framework using real-world search data for TV shows from the Bing search engine. We illustrate how our model can quantify the content preferences associated with each query and how these preferences vary systematically based on whether the query is observed before, during, or after a TV show is aired. We also show that our model can help the search engine improve its ranking of search results as well as address the cold-start problem for new page links.

Based on the three-level rental platform service supply chain network structure composed of manufacturers, rental platform operators and the demand market, a supply chain network equilibrium model considering the digital detection technology input and big data marketing is constructed by using variational inequality and the Nash equilibrium theory, and the optimal decision making conditions of the manufacturers and rental platform operators are derived. Combined with the Euler algorithm design procedure and numerical examples, the influences of the digital detection technology level, big data marketing cost coefficient and cost sharing ratio on the equilibrium state are analyzed. The results show that the input of digital detection technology leads to the increase in profits of each participant in the rental platform service supply chain network and promotes a more coordinated development of the supply chain. When the rental platforms implement big data marketing, the manufacturers share the cost, which can continuously improve the profits of both partners and make the cooperation more stable and efficient. © 2023 by the authors.","big data marketing; digital detection technology investment; network equilibrium; rental platform service supply chain","algorithm; cost analysis; decision making; equilibrium; investment; manufacturing; marketing; numerical model; rental sector; supply chain management; transformation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71802099); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (21GLC005); Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province, (2020SJZDA062)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 71802099), the Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (grant No. 21GLC005) and the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (grant No. 2020SJZDA062).","Martinelli E.M., Farioli M.C., Tunisini A., New companies’ DNA: The heritage of the past industrial revolutions in digital transformation, J.

This problem arises in precision medicine, targeted marketing, personalized education, and many other environments. Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects presents several analytical challenges including high dimensionality and endogeneity issues. We develop a new instrumental variable tree (IVT) approach that incorporates the instrumental variable method into a causal tree (CT) to correct for potential endogeneity biases that may exist in observational data. Our IVT approach partitions subjects into subgroups with similar treatment effects within subgroups and different treatment effects across subgroups. The estimated treatment effects are asymptotically consistent under a set of mild assumptions. Using simulated data, we show our approach has a better coverage rate and smaller mean-squared error than the conventional CT approach. We also demonstrate that an instrumental variable forest (IVF) constructed using IVTs has better accuracy and stratification than a generalized random forest. Finally, by applying the IVF approach to an empirical assessment of laparoscopic colectomy, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity to make accurate comparisons of the heterogeneous effects of the treatment (teaching hospitals) and control (nonteaching hospitals) on different types of patients.

Motivated by the importance of platforms and the wide implementation of Industry 4.0-related advanced technologies, we conduct this study on platform operations. Specifically, the platforms discussed herein are classified into (pure) product selling platforms and service platforms. We identify the platform-related operational issues in four categories: 1) the use of information, 2) operating/manufacturing processes, 3) decision support, and 4) consumer behavior and marketing. Based on the examined real-world practices and reviewed prior studies, we propose the novel '3As' framework to indicate how platforms should 'adopt' advanced technologies to 'address' operational issues to 'achieve' outcomes. In addition, the '3As' framework uncovers possible platform innovations with three extended developments. Finally, we present a future agenda for further studies on the use of advanced technologies in platform operations.

This was achieved through a cross-priority ranking analysis, which identified trends in the development of digital technologies in marketing communications and global marketing. Data from 25 expert organisations was used to form a set of 32 digital solutions. Using a developed methodology, these solutions were ranked, revealing the top 6 with the highest potential for transforming marketing communications. The rankings showed a discrepancy between the mentioned frequency ranking and the priority ranking, indicating the influence of marketing organizations' experience. Currently, social media platforms, particularly influencer marketing, are closely integrated with e-commerce, explaining their high mention frequency. However, a cross-ranking analysis revealed a trend towards AI technologies in marketing communications processes. It has been established that obtaining credit funds for the deployment of modernized marketing campaigns and strategies impacts the financial security of such organizations. Moreover, the utilization of optimal conversion-oriented digital marketing tools allows for a significant reduction in financial risks and an increase in the profitability of companies. The study further identified the future direction of global marketing development, which involves immersive strategies that deeply integrate and extensively use AI technologies. These strategies aim to enhance consumer interest and engagement. The practicality of this research lies in its ability to assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions and reducing the risks of misdirected investments. Further research is recommended to explore practical mechanisms for implementing the identified digital solutions in global marketing processes. This would involve developing a detailed strategy aligned with these technologies. © 2023 by the author(s).","AI & ML; Big Data & Analytics; extended reality; FinTech; influencer marketing; interactive content marketing; MarTech; reduction of financial and credit risks; social commerce; voice marketing; VR/AR/MR; web analytics","","","","","","","","Mageplaza, (2023); Al-Dmour H.

Data were acquired from 236 marketing professionals in the U.S. and Canada working in companies with at least limited experience in big data deployment and analyzed with PLS-SEM. The findings indicate that both the information and technology quality are related to the marketing agility of the firms. Moreover, the result also shows a positive and significant association between decision-making role and information quality. This research provides an understanding of the impact of the quality of BDMA on marketing agility as it relates to the quality of information and a firm's technology, as well as the positive relationship of the decision-making on the aforementioned relationships. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Big data; Big data marketing analytics (BDMA); Decision-making role; Information quality; Marketing agility; Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM); Technology quality","","","","","","","","Adrian C., Abdullah R., Atan R., Jusoh Y.Y., Factors influencing to the implementation success of big data analytics: A systematic literature review, International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS), 2017, pp. 1-6, (2017); Afthanorhan W.M.A.B.W., A comparison of partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) for confirmatory factor analysis, International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology, 2, 5, pp. 198-205, (2013); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

To reduce this complexity, they have introduced category management practices, which consider groups of similar products (categories) that can be managed separately as single business units (SBUs). Although the concept that the store offer should be organised as a category mix and that this strategy allows for better overall store management is already consolidated, retailers still struggle to adopt an approach to the store performance measurement starting from a category level perspective. Nowadays, the available methods for measuring categories’ performance are quite limited. The current trend sees the measurement of category performance mainly based on sell-out data that are ill-equipped to fully address category management issues. Retailers should broaden their field of analysis not only by focusing on the product/sales perspective but also by including other methodologies such as shopper behaviour analysis. In this regard, the use of technology offers the retail sector new perspectives for those analysis. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the retail analytics topic by presenting a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring. More in detail, we could derive a new key performance indicator, category conversion power (CCP), aimed at analysing and comparing the single categories organised within the store. The research is based on a unique dataset obtained from a real-time locating system (RTLS), which allowed us to collect behavioural data togheter with sell-out data (from POS scanner). We argue that retailers could exploit this new analytical method to gain more understanding at the category level and therefore make data-driven decisions aimed at improving performance at the store level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Category management; Performance measurement; Retail marketing; RTLS technology; Shopper behaviour","data set; industrial performance; management practice; marketing; research; retailing; shopping activity","","","","","Grottini Lab","This work was supported by Grottini Lab ( www.grottinilab.com ).

When businesses encounter risky situations (calculated risks) complex models using BDA are often the go-to solution. However, there is a still a debate if BDA is the best solution in uncertain situations when unexpected phenomena arise. The present study begins to fill this gap using the Colombian context as evidence and a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fs-QCA). The focus shifts from a single cause leading to performance to an analysis of different associations of conditions. There are three major findings-first, in a risky environment, BDA is not a unique condition; a combination of data maturity levels, data skills and a data-driven mindset and culture are necessary to obtain good business performance. Second, even in the era of Big Data, large companies still use simple rules (heuristics) to make decisions which improve their performance. Finally, the environmental state (uncertain, certain, risky) is a moderating factor in the choice between BDA or Heuristics.

Existing studies are limited to systematic methodologies for accumulating contemporary practice requirements and using that data to inform the design of educational programmes, even though various, local approaches for doing so often exist in higher education institutions. Going beyond this and adopting design-based research (DBR) principles, this paper introduces industry practitioner perspectives of contemporary- practice need for conceptualisation and design of a new business master’s degree programme. Outlining industry-demand as a driving force in stimulating a new business data-analytics programme at a medium-sized Australian metropolitan university, the study utilises open-ended interviews with five senior data analytics professionals to find a new matrix of industry expectations. The emerged elements are open-sourced tools based general technical knowledge; specific industry certifications or special skills; technology integration knowledge; cross-industry knowledge such as marketing; project management/agility and decision-making utilising appropriate supporting knowledge. Based on these findings, key learning objectives, an initial structure of the programme and specialisation subjects is proposed for further evaluation through convergent interviewing. We anticipated that the entire design process could be reusable for other similar situations for designing new practical courses in higher education sector. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Analytics; Big data; Business discipline; Course design; Curriculum; Higher education","","","","","","","","Albilehi R., Han J.Y., Desmidt H., Curriculum development 101: Lessons learned from a curriculum-design project, The CATESOL Journal, 24, 1, pp. 187-197, (2013); Alturki A., Gable G.G., Bandara W., The design science research roadmap: In Progress evaluation, The Proceedings of the Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, (PACIS 2013) Proceedings, (2013); Asamoah D.A., Sharda R., Zadeh A.H., Preparing a data scientist: A pedagogic experience in designing a big data Analytics course, Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 15, 2, pp. 161-190, (2017); Baskerville R., Baiyere A., Gregor S., Hevner A., Rossi M., Design science research contributions: Finding a balance between artifact and theory, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 19, pp. 358-376, (2018); Carstensen A.K., Bernhard J., Design science research – A powerful tool for improving methods in engineering education research, European Journal of Engineering Education, 44, 1-2, pp. 85-102, 102, (2019); Caza A., Brower H.H., Wayne J.H., Effects of a holistic, experiential curriculum on business students' satisfaction and career confidence, The International Journal of Management Education, 13, pp. 75-83, (2015); Chiang R.H.L., Goes P., Stohr E.A., Business intelligence and analytics education, and program development: A unique opportunity for the information systems discipline, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, 3, 3, pp. 12:1-12:13, (2012); Christian R., Wesfarmers to Open Data Analytics Centre for Retail Growth, (2018); Columbus L., IBM Predicts Demand for Data Scientists Will Soar 28% by 2020.

The results of the surveys carried out with the IT and marketing managers of 95 companies in Spain, analyzed with a comparative methodological approach (dyadic), reveal the sources of the discrepancy, namely, the quality of the data, the technological capabilities, the talent, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) support, and alignment of the data plan with the marketing plan.

Rapid advancements in marketing attribution methods created gaps in the systematic description of the methods and explanation of their capabilities. This paper contrasts theoretically elaborated facilitators and the capabilities of data-driven analytics against the empirically identified classes of marketing attribution. It proposes a novel taxonomy, which serves as a tool for systematic naming and describing marketing attribution methods. The findings allow to reflect on the contemporary attribution methods’ capabilities to account for the specifics of the customer journey, thereby, creating currently lacking theoretical backbone for advancing the accuracy of value attribution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Customer journey analytics;

The study adopted the survey method to collect data in Canada and the United States among the marketing personnel working in firms with at least limited experience in the deployment of BD. The collected data were analyzed with ANOVA and a two-step cluster analysis procedure. The cluster variate included technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge constructs with their relevant indicator variables. The profiling of the clusters was also completed. The findings indicate the existence of two sufficiently large clusters among the marketing personnel. They had very different profiles regarding their gender, decision-making role, BD deployment level in their respective firms, and experience level. This research sheds light on the types of marketing analytics personnel required to implement BDMA successfully. The personnel active in BDMA deployment must have relevant experience in technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge and possess higher decision-making abilities, which enables their firms to proceed successfully to more advanced levels of BDMA deployment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Big Data Marketing Analytics (BDMA); Cluster analysis; Marketing personnel; Profiling","","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Sambamurthy V., Principles and models for organizing the IT function, Strategic information management, (2020); Akter S., Fosso Wamba S., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

Design/methodology/approach: This research delves into how nonprofit institutions, specifically business interest associations (BIAs), have developed their internet presence by applying essential digital marketing techniques. To this end, and using big data mining tools, this study analyzes the tracking by internet users of 102 BIAs, with their respective websites in 36 countries in Europe and the USA. In addition, the presence and activity of the institutions included in this study on social networks are considered. Findings: This research serves as a basis for discussing the current gap between social reality and the digitalization of institutions. In this sense, conclusions are drawn on the importance of managerial profiles in decision-making on digitization and the necessary knowledge that, together with Web and social network managers, they must have to articulate the means and techniques that promote the internet presence of the organizations they manage. Originality/value: Conclusions are drawn according to the geographical scope of the BIAs, and an argument is made about the difficulties of connection and loss of prominence of this type of institutions among their different target audiences, especially among the youngest and most digitized. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business interest associations;

The findings highlight the increasing maturity level, benefits, challenges and future developments in the field. The research confirms that digital analytics supports the analysis and optimisation of digital marketing campaigns, user experience, search engine marketing and data-driven decisions. For many of the companies analysed, the most important challenges were reported to be data quality, lack of skills and data culture; however, maturity level, capabilities, agility and professionalism in digital analytics are steadily increasing, and artificial intelligence is enjoying many new and different applications within the fields of sales and marketing. These findings suggest that companies in German-speaking countries should focus on improving data quality and data culture. © Henry Stewart Publications 2054-7544 (2022).","Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Business analytics; Digital analytics; Marketing analytics; Maturity level; Web analytics","","","","","","","","Brauer C., Reischer D., Modritscher F., What web analysts can do for human-computer interaction?, Proceedings of the International Conference on HCI in Business, pp. 471-481, (2014); Zumstein D., Digital analytics in action: interdisciplinary collaboration in the practice of information systems, Business Informatics in Theory and Practice: Festschrift for Prof. Dr. Andreas Meier, pp. 85-105, (2017); Brauer C., Schlogl S., Organizational challenges concerning business analytics — an empirical analysis in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, Proceedings of the ICT-BDCS Annual International Conference on ICT: Big Data, Cloud and Security, (2017); Digital Analytics & Optimization Maturity Index (DAOMI) maturity model, (2018); Sterne J., Web Metrics, (2002); Jarvinen J., Karjaluoto H., The use of web analytics for digital marketing performance measurement, Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 117-127, (2015); Brauer C., Wimmer A., The mobile analyst: A new job description in the field of business analytics as a manifestation of Big Data, HMD Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik, 53, 3, pp. 357-370, (2016); Web Analytics Definitions, (2008); Wedel M., Kannan P., Marketing analytics for data-rich environments, Journal of Marketing, 80, 6, pp. 97-121, (2016); Meier A., Zumstein D., Web Analytics & Web Controlling — Web-based Business Intelligence for Performance Measurement, (2012); Zumstein D., Gachter I., Digital analytics — implementing strategies in digital business and checking them with KPIs, Business Analytics, pp. 371-388, (2016); Zumstein D., Mohr S., Digital analytics in business practice — usage, challenges and relevant topics, Proceedings of the 16th International Conference e-Society, pp. 257-264, (2018); Cooly R., Mobasher B., Srivastava J., Data preparation for mining world wide web browsing patterns, Knowledge and Information Systems, 1, 1, pp. 5-32, (1999); Spiliopoulou M., Web usage mining for website evaluation, Communication of ACM, 43, 8, pp. 127-134, (2000); Srivastava J., Cooley R., Deshpande M., Tan P.N., Web usage mining: discovery and application of usage patterns from web data, ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery in Data, 1, 2, pp. 1-12, (2000); Huizingh E., The antecendents of website performance, European Journal of Marketing, 36, 11, pp. 1225-1247, (2002); Kaushik A., Web Analytics — An Hour a Day, (2007); Kaushik A., Web Analytics 2.0 — The Art of Online Accountability and Science of Customer Centricity, (2009); Peterson E., Web Analytics Demystified: A Marketer’s Guide to Understanding HowYour Website Affects Your Business, (2004); Weischedel B., Matear S., Deans K., The use of e-metrics in strategic marketing decisions, International Journal of Internet Marketing and Advertising, 2, 1, pp. 109-125, (2005); Aden T., Google Analytics — Implement.

The aim of the current study is to examine the influence of big data (BD) on the performance of service organizations and to probe for a deeper understanding of implementing BD, based on available technologies. Design/methodology/approach: An ethnographic study was conducted following an abductive approach. A primary qualitative research scheme was used with 35 information technology and database professionals participating in five online focus groups of seven participants each. Analytical themes were developed simultaneously with the literature being revisited throughout the study to ultimately create sets of common themes and dimensions. Findings: BD can help organizations build agility, especially within dynamic industries, to better predict customer behavioral patterns and make tailor-made propositions from the BD. An integrated BD-specific framework is proposed to address value according to the dimensions of need, value, time and utility. Research limitations/implications: Little research exists on the key drivers of BD use for dynamic, real-time and agile businesses. This research adds to the developing literature on BD applications to support organizational decision-making and business performance in the tourism industry. Originality/value: This study responds to scholars’ recent calls for more empirical research with contextual understanding of the use of BD to add value in marketing intelligence within business ecosystems. It delineates factors contributing to BD value creation and explores the impacts on the respective service encounters. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","BD-specific framework; Big data; IT experts; Online focus groups; Tourism organizations","","","","","","","","Alaei A.R., Becken S., Stantic B., Sentiment analysis in tourism: capitalizing on big data, Journal of Travel Research, 58, 2, pp. 175-191, (2019); Albrecht T.L., Johnson G.M., Walther J.B., Understanding communication processes in focus groups, Successful Focus Groups: Advancing the State of the Art, 1, pp. 51-64, (1993); Amankwah-Amoah J., Stepping up and stepping out of COVID-19: New challenges for environmental sustainability policies in the global airline industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 271, (2020); Antonio N., de Almeida A., Nunes L., Big data in hotel revenue management: exploring cancellation drivers to gain insights into booking cancellation behavior, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 60, 4, pp. 298-319, (2019); Baig M.I., Shuib L., Yadegaridehkordi E., Big data adoption: State of the art and research challenges, Information Processing and Management, 56, 6, (2019); Benoit D.F., Lessmann S., Verbeke W., On realising the utopian potential of big data analytics for maximising return on marketing investments, Journal of Marketing Management, 36, 3-4, pp. 233-247, (2020); Berg B.L., Lune H., Lune H., Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, 5, (2004); Buhalis D., Technology in tourism-from information communication technologies to eTourism and smart tourism towards ambient intelligence tourism: a perspective article, Tourism Review, 75, 1, pp. 267-272, (2020); Buhalis D., Amaranggana A., Smart tourism destinations enhancing tourism experience through personalisation of services, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism, pp. 377-389, (2015); Buhalis D., Leung R., Smart hospitality—interconnectivity and interoperability towards an ecosystem, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 71, pp. 41-50, (2018); Buhalis D., Sinarta Y., Real-Time Co-Creation and nowness service: Lessons from tourism and hospitality, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 36, 5, pp. 563-582, (2019); Buhalis D., Volchek K., Bridging marketing theory and big data analytics: the taxonomy of marketing attribution, International Journal of Information Management, 56, (2020); Buhalis D., Harwood T., Bogicevic V., Viglia G., Beldona S., Hofacker C., Technological disruptions in services: lessons from tourism and hospitality, Journal of Service Management, 30, 4, pp. 484-506, (2019); Casalo L.V., Romero J., Social media promotions and travelers’ value-creating behaviors: the role of perceived support, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 2, pp. 633-650, (2019); Centobelli P., Ndou V., Managing customer knowledge through the use of big data analytics in tourism research, Current Issues in Tourism, 22, 15, pp. 1862-1882, (2019); Chareyron G., Da-Rugna J., Raimbault T., Big data: a new challenge for tourism, 2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 5-7, (2014); Conboy K., Dennehy D., O'Connor M., Big time’: an examination of temporal complexity and business value in analytics, Information and Management, 57, 1, (2020); Corte-Real N., Ruivo P., Oliveira T., Popovic A., Unlocking the drivers of big data analytics value in firms, Journal of Business Research, 97, pp. 160-173, (2019); d'Amore M., Baggio R., Valdani E., A practical approach to big data in tourism: a low cost raspberry Pi cluster, In Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2015, pp. 169-181, (2015); Davenport T., Harris J., Competing on Analytics: Updated, with a New Introduction: The New Science of Winning, (2017); Del Vecchio P., Mele G., Ndou V., Secundo G., Creating value from social big data: implications for smart tourism destinations, Information Processing and Management, 54, 5, pp. 847-860, (2018); Demirkan H., Delen D., Leveraging the capabilities of Service-Oriented decision support systems: Putting analytics and big data in cloud, Decision Support Systems, 55, 1, pp. 412-421, (2013); Donthu N., Gustafsson A., Effects of COVID-19 on business and research, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 284-289, (2020); Glazer R., Weiss A.M., Marketing in turbulent environments: decision processes and the time-sensitivity of information, Journal of Marketing Research, 30, 4, pp. 509-521, (1993); Gonzalez R., Gasco J., Llopis J., ICTs in hotel management: a research review, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 31, 9, pp. 3583-3609, (2019); Goulding C., Grounded theory, ethnography and phenomenology.

The data pertaining to the BDDCE practices were collected from the decision-makers in three groups, namely, purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics & marketing function from the auto-component manufacturing industry. First, the consensus on the BDDCE practices within the group was ascertained followed by determining the decision weights using the percentage distributions and subjective weights. This was followed by the by computing the dominance degrees on pairwise comparisons of the BDDCE practices and ranking them using the PROMETHEE II method. The findings indicated that the BDDCE practices that were more inclined towards the enhancement of internal supply chain integration were most preferred and highly ranked by the decisionmakers in the auto-component industry as compared to the practices that were focused on improving the supplier and customer interfaces such as green purchasing, sale of excess inventory, and developing recycling systems for end-of-life products and materials. The high ranked BDDCE practices included minimization of the raw material consumption, plan for reuse, recycle, recovery of material, parts, and reduction of the process waste at the design stage. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Automobile industry; Big Data; Circular economy; Large group decision making; PROMETHEE; Sustainability","Big data; Green manufacturing; Recycling; Sales; Supply chains; Automobile components; Customer interfaces; End-of-life products; Large group decision makings; Marketing functions; Pair-wise comparison; Raw material consumption; Supply-chain integration; automobile industry; decision making; environmental economics; green economy; manufacturing; recycling; sustainability; waste management; Decision making","","","","","","","(2020); Arora N., Bhattacharjya S., Goel A., Gulati P., Bhavnani C., Sharma A., Shekhar H., Circular Economy: A Business Imperative for India, (2018); Barrane F.Z., Ndubisi N.O., Kamble S., Karuranga G.E., Poulin D., Building trust in multi-stakeholder collaborations for new product development in the digital transformation era, Benchmarking, (2020); Belhadi A., Kamble S.S., Jabbour C.J.C., Gunasekaran A., Ndubisi N.O., Venkatesh M., Manufacturing and service supply chain resilience to the COVID-19 outbreak: lessons learned from the automobile and airline industries, Technol.

ExC describes the technological and algorithmic extension of (and annexation of) cognition in a consumption context. ExC provides a framework to enhance the understanding of the impact of pervasive computing and smart technology on consumer decision-making and the behavioural impacts of consumer analytics. To this end, the article provides commentary and structures to outline the impact of ExC and to elaborate the definition and reach of ExC. The logic of ExC culminates in a theory of cognitive states comprising of three potential decision states: endogenous cognition, symbiotic cognition and surrogate cognition. These states are posited as transient (consumers might move between them during a purchase episode) and determined by individual propensities and situational antecedents. The article latterly provides various potential empirical avenues and issues for consideration and debate. © The Author(s) 2020.","Algorithmic; analytics; Big Data; consumer; decision-making; exogenous cognition; marketing","","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L021080/1, EP/M02315X/1)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the EPSRC project ‘Neo-demographics: Opening Developing World Markets by Using Personal Data and Collaboration’ EP/L021080/1 and by the EPSRC project ‘From Human Data to Personal Experience’ EP/M02315X/1.

The paper adopts qualitative research, based on nine in-depth interviews with key informants, to capture senior executives' experiences with implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in their organisations. The research is focused on three manufacturing industries: the automotive, food and furniture industries. The research shows that depending on the stage of the value chain, different Industry 4.0 technologies are more suitable for the support of managers' decisions. Various Industry 4.0 technologies support decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain. In the Design stage, 3D printing and scanning technologies play a crucial role. In the case of Inbound Logistics, robotisation, automation, Big Data analysis, and Business Intelligence are most useful. During the Manufacturing stage, robotisation, automation, 3D printing, scanning, Business Intelligence, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine (M2M) integration enable quick decision-making and speed up production. Sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) optimise distribution in the Outbound Logistics stage. And finally, Business Intelligence supports decisions within the Sales and Marketing stage. It is also the most versatile technology among all particular stages. The paper provides empirical evidence on the Industry 4.0 technology support in decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain, which leads to more effective value chain management, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions at each value-chain stage. When using properly selected Industry 4.0 technologies, managers can optimise their production processes, reduce costs, avoid errors and improve customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, Industry 4.0 technologies facilitate predictive analytics to forecast and anticipate future demand, quality issues, and potential risks. This knowledge allows organisations to make better decisions and take proactive actions to prevent problems.  © 2023 Michał Młody et al., published by Sciendo.","decision-making; Industry 4.0; manufacturing industry; technologies; value chain","3D printing; Customer satisfaction; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Predictive analytics; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Business-intelligence; Decision-making process; Decisions makings; Different stages; Manufacturing industries; Technology; Technology support; Value chains; Decision making","","","","","","","Abdelmajied F.Y., Industry 4.0 and Its Implications: Concept, Opportunities, and Future Dirctions, Supply Chain - Recent Advances and New Perspectives in the Industry 4.0 Era, (2022); Alvesson M., Ashcraft L.K., Interviews, Qualitative Organizational Research.

However, little research focuses on holistically applying customer intelligence from defining and acquiring the right type of customer intelligence to applying and evaluating it for optimal outcomes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to value creation from customer intelligence in marketing. Adapted from Bloom's taxonomy, the proposed approach significantly contributes to identifying the six levels of applying customer intelligence in marketing, including defining relevant types of customer intelligence, building appropriate strategies, identifying customer data, understanding customer analytics, setting key performance indicators for the evaluation purpose, and creating value through business questions and the interactive dashboard.  © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","big data;

However, the existing research on the model construction and quantitative analysis of the psychological process of green consumption behavior needs to be further explored. Therefore, on the basis of green consumption behavior and metacognitive theory, this study constructs a conceptual model of a psychological process with a psychological control source, green consumption attitude, three aspects of metacognition, and green consumption behavior and puts forward the hypothesis of an action mechanism. This study combines text mining technology and expert knowledge to establish a user review mining dictionary and mines the variables in the quantitative conceptual model through word embedding to test empirically the mechanism hypothesis. The results show that psychological control source has a significant impact on green consumption behavior, and green consumption attitude plays a partial mediating role between them. Metacognitive knowledge plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption behavior; metacognitive experience plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption attitude. Metacognitive monitoring plays a moderating role between green consumption attitude and green consumption behavior. In view of the above research results, we put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions: For organizations, it is necessary to identify green consumption groups, attach importance to green consumption experience, perform well in green marketing, and improve the competitiveness of green products; for decision makers, it is necessary to control strictly the industry standards of the green product market and perform well not only in the quality supervision of green products but also in the post-market construction of green products. © 2023 by the authors.","green consumption behavior; metacognitive theory; psychological control source; text mining technology","alternative energy; carbon emission; consumption behavior; decision making; environmental impact; environmental policy; green economy; industrial regulation; quantitative analysis","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (19BSH105)","This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China: 19BSH105 And the APC was funded by [19BSH105].","Stockkamp C., Schaefer J., Millemann J.A.A., Heidenreich S., Identifying Factors Associated with Consumers’ Adoption of e-Mobility-A Systematic Literature Review, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Wang S., Exploring the Sustainability of China’s New Energy Vehicle Development: Fresh Evidence from Population Symbiosis, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Young W., Hwang K., McDonald S., Oates C.J., Sustainable Consumption: Green Consumer Behaviour when Purchasing Products, Sustain.

The study aims to develop a marketing data analytics framework to manage online reviews, especially fake reviews, which have become a significant issue undermining the creditability of online review systems. As small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the capabilities to automatically derive customer insights from online reviews, this study proposes a cost-effective, extensible Review-Analytics-as-a-Service (RAaaS) framework that can be operated by non-data specialists to facilitate online review data analytics. We demonstrate the framework’s application by using two datasets with more than 400,000 online reviews from Yelp to simulate live platforms and demonstrate an analytic flow of review fraud detection and understanding. The findings reveal insights into the influence of fake reviews on product ranking and exposure rate. Moreover, it was found that there was a higher concentration of sadness and anger in fake reviews (vs. organic reviews). In addition, fake reviews tend to be shorter, more extreme (with the use of strong adverbs), and have different patterns of topic distribution. This study has important implications for different stakeholder groups including, but not limited to, SMEs, review platforms and customers. © 2023 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.","Big data analytics; fake reviews; marketing decisions; product ranking","","","","","","","","Abdi H., Williams L., Principal component analysis, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics, 2, 4, pp. 433-459, (2010); Anderl E., Marz A., Schumann J.H., Nonmonetary customer value contributions in free e-services, 24, 3-4, pp. 175-189, (2016); Bakpayev M., Baek T.H., van Esch P., Yoon S., Programmatic creative: Ai can think but it cannot feel, Australasian Marketing Journal, 30, 1, pp. 90-95, (2022); Barbado R., Araque O., Iglesias C.A., A framework for fake review detection in online consumer electronics retailers, Information Processing & Management, 56, 4, pp. 1234-1244, (2019); Bastwadkar M., McGregor C., Balaji S., A cloud based big data health-analytics-as-a-service framework to support low resource setting neonatal intensive care unit, pp. 30-36, (2020); Bilgihan A., Kandampully J., Zhang T., Towards a unified customer experience in online shopping environments: Antecedents and outcomes, International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, 8, pp. 102-119, (2016); Birim S.O., Kazancoglu I., Kumar Mangla S., Kahraman A., Kumar S., Kazancoglu Y., Detecting fake reviews through topic modelling, Journal of Business Research, 149, pp. 884-900, (2022); Bueno I., Carrasco R.A., Urena R., Herrera-Viedma E., A business context aware decision-making approach for selecting the most appropriate sentiment analysis technique in e-marketing situations, Information Sciences, 589, pp. 300-320, (2022); Chen H.M., Chang K.C., Lin T.H., A cloud-based system framework for performing online viewing, storage, and analysis on big data of massive BIMs, Automation in Construction, 71, pp. 34-48, (2016); Choi S., Mattila A.S., Van Hoof H.B., Quadri-Felitti D., The role of power and incentives in inducing fake reviews in the tourism industry, Journal of Travel Research, 56, 8, pp. 975-987, (2017); Coleman S., Gob R., Manco G., Pievatolo A., Tort-Martorell X., Reis M.S., How can SMEs benefit from big data?

Methods of collecting data, types of data analyzed, and data analytics techniques have changed substantially in recent years. It is important, therefore, to examine the current state of marketing research, and particularly self-administered questionnaires. This paper provides researchers important advice and rules of thumb for crafting high quality research in light of the contemporary changes occuring in modern marketing data collection practices. This is accomplished by a proposed six-step research design process that ensures data quality, and ultimately research integrity, are established and maintained throughout the research process—from the earliest conceptualization and design phases, through data collection, and ultimately the reporting of results. This paper provides a framework, which if followed, will result in reduced headaches for researchers and more robust results for decision makers. © The Author(s) 2021.","big data; data analytics; data quality;

This paper aims to provide insight into the seller disclosure of flood risk and buyer behaviour in the absence of mandated seller disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a case study approach to critically evaluate the matrix of flood information available for buyers purchasing residential property in Brisbane, Queensland. This paper uses big data analytic techniques to extract and analyse internet data from online seller agents and buyer platforms to gain an understanding of buyer awareness and consideration of flood risk in the residential property market. Findings: Analysis of property marketing data demonstrates that seller agents voluntarily disclose flood impact only in periods where a flooding event is anticipated and is limited to asserting a property is free of flood risk. Analysis of buyer commentary demonstrates that buyers are either unaware of flood information or are discounting the risk of flood in favour of other property and locational attributes when selecting residential property. Practical implications: This research suggests that improved and accessible government-provided flood mapping tools are not enhancing buyers’ understanding and awareness of flood risk. Accordingly, it is recommended that mandatory disclosure be introduced in Queensland so that buyers are more able to manage risk and investment decisions before the purchase of residential property. Originality/value: This paper contributes to existing literature on raising community awareness and understanding of natural disaster risks and makes a further contribution in identifying mandatory disclosure as a mechanism to highlight the risk of flooding and inform residential property purchasers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Community resilience; Consumer behaviour; Disaster management; Flood risk; Natural hazard","","","","","","Queensland University of Technology, QUT","The authors wish to acknowledge the contribution of Dr Rouhshi Low in reviewing and editing earlier versions of this paper, and the financial assistance provided by the Consumer Policy and Regulation Research Group, QUT Law School, Queensland University of Technology.

It is necessary to explore this information using analysis techniques based on Big Data since the result greatly values decision-making. This paper aims to evaluate the titles of the reviews published on Tripadvisor about 3 and 4-star hotels of a World Heritage City (Cáceres, Extremadura, Spain) to outline the attributes most valued by tourists. Content analysis was performed using the user-generated content (UGC) in Tripadvisor, together with techniques that facilitated the processing of the data to discover the most important characteristics assessed by clients during their stays. The analysis shows a positive evaluation of the hotels in the city of Cáceres, highlighting the hotel stay, location, service, and value for money as the most outstanding elements. Based on the results obtained, a recommendation for hotel managers is to focus their communication strategies on location, quality, and price factors. It is worth noting the importance that the implementation of Big Data techniques of analysis has for the sector, allowing for better knowledge of clients and helping to maintain a competitive position in the market. © 2022 by the authors.","content analysis; hotel sector; NVIVO; tourism marketing; user-generated content (UGC)","Extremadura; Spain; Spain; communication network; knowledge economy; tourism economics; tourism market","","","","","Consejería de Economía, Ciencia y Agenda Digital, (GR21096); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Junta de Extremadura","The dissemination of the results of this research is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Junta de Extremadura (Consejería de Economía, Ciencia y Agenda Digital) (Reference No. GR21096).","Mas A., Ramon A.B., Aranda P., La revolución digital en el sector turístico.

As a result, the problem of bringing empirical knowledge about the importance of digitalization technologies in the company’s marketing management to a theoretical model has been solved. Digitalization technologies for implementation in marketing activities were selected and the decomposition of marketing management in a commercial company was performed. On this basis, a theoretical model for assessing the impact of digitalization technologies on the marketing management of a commercial company has been developed. The results of an empirical study based on the developed theoretical model proved the truth of the hypothesis about the positive impact of the spread of the use of digitalization technologies on the marketing management components of commercial companies. The choice of specific digitalization technologies is explained by the essence of marketing as a management activity. Structural decomposition of the marketing management process is explained by traditional management functions and clarifies the criteria for choosing technologies. The results of calculations according to the formed theoretical model are explained by the development of the platform economy and ecosystems, which involve the studied big data technologies, cloud computing and social media, as well as blockchain. The methodical approach to substantiating the role of digitalization technologies proposed in this study is characterized by the use of fundamental provisions on cybernetic systems, management theory, and modern marketing concepts. The obtained results make it possible to find out the presence and direction of the effects of the spread of the use of digitalization technologies in the company’s marketing management and make informed decisions about the business digitalization strategy © 2022, Authors.

The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components. It was a detailed study of the current state of brand marketing strategies and customer satisfaction, found key indicators of brands that could improve customer satisfaction, and presented corresponding suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies. It shows that. It has the importance of good guidance and references to improve customer satisfaction in the industry. © 2021","Big Data; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Factor Analysis; Machine learning; Meta-combined approach","Big data; Consumer behavior; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Finance; Philosophical aspects; Sales; Strategic planning; Surveys; Behavior evaluations; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Customer perspectives; Customers' satisfaction; Equity analysis; Factors analysis; Marketing research; Marketing strategy; Meta-combined approach; Machine learning","","","","","Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China","This work was supported by Qing Lan Project, Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence (No.CM20183002) and Major Cultivating Projects of CZIMT (2019ZDXM09).","Argyris Y.A., Wang Z., Kim Y., Yin Z., The effects of visual congruence on increasing consumers’ brand engagement: An empirical investigation of influencer marketing on instagram using deep-learning algorithms for automatic image classification, Computers in Human Behavior, 112, (2020); Cui F., Hu H., Xie Y., An intelligent optimization method of E-commerce product marketing, Neural Computing & Applications, 33, pp. 4097-4110, (2021); Ezenwafor E.C., Ayodele A.A., Chukwudi Ireneus Nwaizugbo.

This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice. Hence, this study could stimulate researchers to deepen the phenomenon and empirically validate the propositions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Cognitive computing; Data-driven decision-making; Growth hacking; International dynamic marketing capabilities; International marketing","","","","","","","","Abbott A.D., Methods of Discovery: Heuristics for the Social Sciences (Contemporary Societies), (2004); Abkenar S.B., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Jameii S.M., Big data analytics meets social media: a systematic review of techniques, open issues, and future directions, Telematics and Informatics, 57, (2021); Acosta A.S., Crespo A.H., Agudo J.C., Effect of market orientation, network capability and entrepreneurial orientation on international performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), International Business Review, 27, 6, pp. 1128-1140, (2018); Ajmal M.M., Koskinen K.U., Knowledge transfer in project-based organizations: an organizational culture perspective, Project Management Journal, 39, 1, pp. 7-15, (2008); Albaum G.S., Albaum G., Duerr E., International Marketing and Export Management, (2008); Allsop D.T., Bassett B.R., Hoskins J.A., Word-of-mouth research: principles and applications, Journal of Advertising Research, 47, 4, pp. 398-411, (2007); Alvesson M., Sandberg J., Generating research questions through problematization, Academy of Management Review, 36, 2, pp. 247-271, (2011); Argyris Y.A., Monu K., Corporate use of social media: technology affordance and external stakeholder relations, Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce, 25, 2, pp. 140-168, (2015); Asseraf Y., Lages L.F., Shoham A., Assessing the drivers and impact of international marketing agility, International Marketing Review, 36, 2, pp. 289-315, (2018); Autio E., Sapienza H.J., Comparing process and born global perspectives in the international growth of technology-based new firms, Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, pp. 413-424, (2000); Barrales-Molina V., Martinez-Lopez F.J., Gazquez-Abad J.C., Dynamic marketing capabilities: toward an integrative framework: dynamic marketing capabilities, International Journal of Management Reviews, 16, 4, pp. 397-416, (2014); Berry M.J., Linoff G.S., Data Mining Techniques: For Marketing, Sales, and Customer Relationship Management, (2004); Bertello A., Ferraris A., Bresciani S., De Bernardi P., Big data analytics (BDA) and degree of internationalization: the interplay between governance of BDA infrastructure and BDA capabilities, Journal of Management and Governance, 25, pp. 1-21, (2020); Bharadwaj A., El Sawy O.A., Pavlou P.A., Venkatraman N., Digital business strategy: toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Bloomfield B.P., Latham Y., Vurdubakis T., Bodies, technologies and action possibilities: when is an affordance?, Sociology, 44, 3, pp. 415-433, (2010); Bohnsack R., Liesner M.M., What the hack?

In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising","Competition; Efficiency; Electronic commerce; Marketing; Advertising strategy; Advertizing; Commerce platforms; E-commerce platform; Loyalty program; Market competition; Membership; Online merchants; Targeted advertising; Targeted marketing; Costs","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801210, 72001200)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71801210, Grant 72001200","Zhong Z., Sanping Z., Yuzhen L., Research on the precise marketing method of goods based on Big Data technology, Proc. 2nd Int.

E-retailers, for example, effectively use large volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business operations data to aid operations and supply chain management. Although logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions, leaving it an under-researched area of study. Adding to this research stream by exploring the case of a U.K.-based fast-fashion retailer, this article reveals unique consumer segments and links them to the revenue they are capable of generating. Applying the partitioning around medoids algorithm to three random samples of 10 000 unique consumer visits to the e-commerce site of a fast-fashion retailer, six consumer segments are identified. This article shows that although the 'mobile window shoppers' segment consists of the largest consumer segment, it attracts the lowest revenue. In contrast, 'visitors with a purpose,' although one of the smallest segments, generates the highest revenue. The findings of this article contribute to marketing research and inform practice, which can use these insights to target customer segments in a more tailored fashion.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Apparel retailing; big data; clickstream data; consumer segmentation; online purchase","Big data; Data Analytics; Electronic commerce; Machine learning; Metadata; Supply chain management; Apparel retailing; Business operation; Clickstream data; Consumer segmentation; Consumer segments; Data analytics; Large volumes; Machine-learning; Market researches; Online purchase; Sales","","","","","","","Choi T.M., Information Systems for theFashion and Apparel Industry., (2016); Bhardwaj V., Fairhurst A., Fast fashion: Response to changes in the fashion industry, Int.

PSM encompasses activities that involve 1) strategic planning for current and future needs, and 2) operational purchasing of goods and services from external suppliers (Spina et al., 2013). Studies in the literature have demonstrated that PSM can have a significant influence on the success of a company's supply chain as well as the performance of the company (González-Benito, 2007; Patrucco et al., 2023). In many industries, purchasing organizations contribute to innovation (Patrucco et al., 2022a), help build organizational resilience (Pereira et al., 2020), enable better production performance, and ultimately maximize organizational results. Consequently, purchasing departments and PSM activities have become more important and are increasingly recognized as strategic peers to their marketing, manufacturing, and finance counterparts. Due to their strategic role, many companies are focusing on how to develop a more effective PSM decision-making process (Patrucco et al., 2023); in this sense, understanding how BDA can contribute to this effectiveness is at the top of managers’ agenda (Moretto et al., 2017). PSM activities produce a massive amount of internally generated data (such as spend data, contract data, and supplier performance data), which can be easily integrated with data from external sources of information (Moretto et al., 2017). Purchasing organizations are able to gain additional knowledge to support spend analysis and classification, supply network design and relationship management, supply market intelligence, and risk management by making use of BDA in conjunction with more or less complex techniques to analyze structured and unstructured data (e.g., Arvidsson et al., 2021; Hallikas et al., 2021; Handfield et al., 2019; McKinsey & Company, 2021).This study aims to contribute to this field by starting from the theoretical premise that AC and knowledge management capabilities are prerequisites for organizations to derive value and create new knowledge from data generated by supply chain processes. Specifically, to understand how such capabilities impact the use of BDA in supporting decision-making processes in PSM, we consider the four typical dimensions of AC (Lane et al., 2006; Zahra and George, 2002): (1) the ability to identify new and external knowledge (i.e., acquisition capabilities); (2) the ability to assimilate external knowledge (i.e., assimilation capabilities); (3) the ability to transform external knowledge into new knowledge (i.e., transformation capabilities); and (4) the ability to apply the assimilated and newly generated knowledge (i.e., exploitation capabilities).We collected survey responses from 222 purchasing and supply chain managers across various industries and company sizes. The respondents evaluated their purchasing organization's characteristics and the extent to which BDA supported PSM activities and decisions. Using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM), we tested the relationships and found that higher levels of acquisition, assimilation, and transformation capabilities are precursors for the utilization of BDA in strategic PSM decision-making. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of BDA in PSM enhances exploitation capabilities, and acts as a mediator for the positive relationship between BDA and performance improvement. While acquisition, assimilation, and transformation capabilities continue to drive greater BDA use in operational decision-making, they do not directly contribute to exploitation capabilities and performance improvement.These findings significantly advance the theoretical and practical understanding of the role of BDA in SCM. First, our research empirically supports studies that explored how organizations can leverage BDA for strategic decision-making thanks to knowledge management capabilities and processes (e.g., Lozada et al., 2023). Second, it enhances our understanding of how organizations can harness the power of BDA in PSM, an under-researched area within SCM (Arvidsson et al., 2021). Organizations that have matured in their ability to utilize BDA for strategic decision-making and rely on strong purchasing AC are the ones that can truly benefit from the performance enhancements derived from these technologies.The use of BDA to support production management decisions has received the most research interest (Nguyen et al., 2018). Authors have discussed the application of prescriptive analytics in production planning and inventory management (e.g., Hofmann, 2017; Papadopoulos et al., 2017), and how BDA can support quality control and decisions related to equipment maintenance (Hazen et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017). Several SCM scholars have also focused on BDA applications in logistics and transportation management, particularly on how BDA can support logistics network design and the optimization of transportation routes (Mehmood et al., 2017; Neilson et al., 2019). The contribution of BDA to demand management is another well-researched topic that focuses on how BDA can help improve the accuracy of forecasting models and the alignment between forecasted demand and internal capacity (e.g., Hofmann and Rutschmann, 2018).Despite the increasing digitalization of PSM activities (Hallikas et al., 2021; Patrucco et al., 2020; Seyedghorban et al., 2020), SCM research has paid much less attention to the application of BDA in this domain. While empirical evidence exists in the areas of supplier selection and evaluation (e.g., Lamba and Singh, 2019) and supplier risk management (e.g., Araz et al., 2020), research on BDA in PSM remains scattered, especially regarding the role of these technologies in supporting strategic decision-making (Arvidsson et al., 2021). Theoretical and empirical evidence on how to incorporate BDA into the PSM decision-making process is still lacking; therefore, in the context of the strategic role that purchasing organizations play for businesses, this should be considered from a research perspective (McKinsey & Company, 2021).Although BDA in SCM has received increasing attention due to the possibility of obtaining value from a massive and growing volume of data and gaining a commanding competitive advantage in the planning and execution of complex processes, supply chains in many industries are still lagging behind in their use, particularly in supporting decision-making processes (KPMG, 2018). Previous research has identified several obstacles to effective BDA implementation, including the inability to build suitable high-quality databases, data security concerns, and the complexity of BDA techniques (Alharthi et al., 2017). Studies in the literature on information systems have emphasized the significance of knowledge management capabilities in relation to the adoption of innovative technologies when discussing these enablers and barriers (e.g. Mahmood and Mubarik, 2020; Roberts et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). In the case of BDA, there is still a need to learn how the insights generated by these technologies can be exploited by articulating them with the skills of individuals and other processes involving the acquisition, organization, and application of knowledge (Lozada et al., 2023). Recent SCM literature has also promoted a need for increasing appropriate knowledge management skills in organizational resources to extract value from BDA, especially in PSM (Arvidsson et al., 2021; Öhman et al., 2021). Big data cannot be used as a direct input for decision-making due to its complexity. It must be interpreted, and in order to do that, organizations require competent individuals who can use the appropriate data as a starting point, correctly apply data analysis techniques, and interpret the data in the context of organizational policies and the business environment (Lozada et al., 2023). AC represents a key organizational capability to do this (Lam et al., 2017).The role of AC in the adoption of advanced technologies is theoretically supported by several studies in the information systems literature (e.g., Ardito et al., 2022; Saraf et al., 2013). Some studies have shown that the processes of acquiring, assimilating, and exploiting unique and novel knowledge enable the use of technology in novel ways (Wang et al., 2014). Similarly, research has demonstrated that greater digital skills positively impact AC, thereby enhancing organizational performance (Bolívar-Ramos et al., 2013), and that AC is essential for establishing technology infrastructure that generates organizational value (Elbashir et al., 2011).This is even more important in the context of SCM processes, where the critical information required to improve supply chain performance is primarily accessible from external sources and not readily available for decision-making (Handfield et al., 2019). As BDA can provide crucial new information that can be used to support strategic decision-making in SCM, companies must have structured routines to enable the organization to acquire, assimilate, transform, and apply knowledge derived from BDA to make more effective SCM decisions (Wang et al., 2016). The interplay between AC and BDA is thus crucial for leveraging BDA effectively to enhance performance in the area where BDA is introduced. It empowers organizations to convert raw data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and strategy, thereby creating dynamic capabilities (Božič and Dimovski, 2019; Ardito et al., 2022). This is especially true for the PSM process, where the AC of purchasing departments has frequently been linked to a company's capacity to capture external knowledge and use it to introduce innovations, thereby favoring the success of these innovation initiatives and enhancing performance (e.g., DiFrancesco et al., 2022; Kauppi et al., 2013; Knoppen et al., 2022; Patrucco et al., 2022a; Picaud-Bello et al., 2022).Using the research model depicted in Fig. 1, we contribute to the literature by connecting BDA and knowledge management using PSM as the unit of analysis. We base our model on two theoretical premises: the AC of PSM is related to BDA adoption and associated benefits, and to obtain these benefits, companies should invest in and utilize BDA to support strategic decision-making and activities, as opposed to operational ones.To theorize how purchasing AC relates to the use of BDA to support strategic PSM activities, we are aligned with prior research (e.g., Flatten et al., 2011) that regarded AC as a second-order construct that builds, integrates, and reconfigures underlying first-order capabilities to create and deploy new knowledge. However, while previous studies considered the relationship between AC and BDA, and viewed AC as a unique construct (e.g., Božič and Dimovski, 2019; Elbashir et al., 2011; Wamba and Akter, 2019), our theoretical argument is based on the idea that the three different components of AC play a different role in the use, adoption, and value creation from BDA for strategic decision-making (e.g., Wang et al., 2014). Particularly, we argue that not all AC components represent antecedent or subsequent organizational technology adoption capabilities (ideas that were proposed, under different theoretical lenses, by previous studies (e.g., Cepeda-Carrion et al., 2012; Setia and Patel, 2013; Mahmood and Mubarik, 2020). Instead, our model considers the capabilities of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, and transformation as drivers of BDA adoption, while the final component, knowledge exploitation, represents a capability that can be strengthened by BDA, and also facilitates performance improvement. The model's main hypotheses are discussed next.Our paper adopts a deductive approach, aligning with the nature and objectives of our research. We build on the established theories of BDA and AC (Lam et al., 2017) and apply these theories to the context of PSM. This approach allows us to test the theoretical premise that AC and knowledge management capabilities are vital for organizations to extract value and generate new knowledge from supply chain data (Lam et al., 2017). We focus specifically on the four principal dimensions of AC and the relationship between these AC components within purchasing organizations, and the use of BDA to support strategic PSM activities.The responses to the pilot survey provided feedback in three areas, with the first pertaining to the obstacles and difficulties in using BDA in PSM. Several respondents cited a lack of skills to identify the right information to feed the analysis and how to use the results to support decision-making as the primary barrier to BDA adoption in purchasing. This finding reinforced the significance of linking AC to BDA. The second finding relates to BDA application areas. Due to the possibility of increasing the knowledge and information available for complex decisions, 31 of the 34 respondents indicated that their organizations utilized BDA to support strategic purchasing activities to varying degrees. The third component relates to the potential impact of implementing BDA for purchasing activities. All the respondents highlighted a direct (and intangible) impact on the ability of purchasing employees to make better decisions, but emphasized an indirect but substantial contribution to a number of operational performance areas, including purchasing costs, supplier quality, and level of service. This exploratory data was incorporated into the initial design of the survey instrument and assisted in its revision.To measure the use of BDA for purchasing activities, the respondents were first made aware of the meaning of BDA in line with the definition provided by Kache and Seuring (2017), who conceptualized BDA as “the application of advanced statistics to any kind of electronic communication … [with] the aim to identify behavioral patterns within the data” (p. 10). Regarding BDA adoption in the purchasing process, we could not find a survey scale in the literature that could be easily adapted or used. Therefore, we searched the literature for articles that defined the structure of the purchasing procedure. Existing classifications of purchasing activities (e.g., Bäckstrand et al., 2019; Luzzini et al., 2014; Moretto et al., 2017; Van Raaij, 2016) included demand planning, category strategy development, supply risk management, spend management, and performance management among the strategic activities. We included all the activities associated with the contract-order-delivery-payment cycle, such as supplier selection and negotiation, order management, logistics management, invoice management, and fraud detection, under operational purchasing. With this distinction in mind, we asked respondents to rate the extent to which their company utilized BDA to support strategic and operational purchasing activities.A participation email was sent to 1,026 purchasing and supply chain professionals on the research team's contact list. We received 387 responses between November 2020 and January 2021 (representing a raw questionnaire completion rate of approximately 40%); only 222 were deemed useable for our study after excluding 1) responses with missing values on critical items, and/or 2) unreliable responses (e.g., same values provided to all items), and/or 3) responses were respondents indicated that their company did not use BDA to support PSM activities (value = 1 for the questions “BDA for purchasing activities”). Table 1 provides a summary of the descriptive data for the final empirical sample.As anticipated in subsection 3.2, the survey instrument also asked the respondents to rate how their company used BDA to support more operational activities included in the purchasing process. Although traditionally, BDA is expected to support strategic decision-making (Richey et al., 2016; Tiwari et al., 2018), due to the scarcity of literature on BDA use in PSM, we considered it useful to run the same model hypothesized in Fig. 1 but for operational purchasing activities. This construct shows good convergent validity (CR = 0.791, CA = 0.752, AVE = 55.75%), including items BDA7, BDA8, BDA9 and BDA10. Instead, BDA11 (i.e., BDA support for fraud detection activities) was dropped following the CFA. Both the measurement (χ2/d.f. = 2.19; CFI = 0.903; TLI = 0.884; SRMR = 0.071 RMSEA = 0.074) and structural (χ2/d.f. = 2.16; CFI = 0.901; TLI = 0.890; SRMR = 0.074 RMSEA = 0.073) models have sufficient fit to the data. The results of the path analysis are reported in Fig. 2, in comparison with the results obtained for the main research model.In contrast to previous model testing, the results indicate that the use of BDA for operational purchasing is not associated with greater exploitation capabilities (β = 0.106, p > 0.05). The use of BDA for operational purchasing is not significantly related to BDA's contribution to performance improvement (β = 0.088, p > 0.05). Acquisition (β = 0.278, p 0.01) and assimilation and transformation (β = 0.221, p 0.05) capabilities continue to be positively associated with greater use of BDA to support purchasing activities.By validating hypotheses H1 and H2, we demonstrate that exploration and assimilation capabilities are the drivers and prerequisites for a greater use of BDA to support strategic PSM activities. Purchasing organizations struggle to incorporate BDA into their decision-making if the organization is not open to exploring the external environment for new supply markets and supply chain knowledge or assimilating such knowledge inflows from the outside. The types of data that are most relevant to their strategic PSM activities are more likely to be known by purchasing departments, with greater knowledge acquisition capabilities. This can assist them in identifying the appropriate data sources for their BDA projects. Through knowledge assimilation and transformation capabilities, they can generate information of a higher quality by integrating data from multiple sources, such as their procurement systems, supplier databases, and external data sources (e.g. market intelligence reports). On the basis of this data, they are able to obtain more in-depth insights through the use of BDA, which can inform strategic PSM decisions. Purchasing organizations with high internal capabilities in the areas of market, technology, and competitor scouting, as well as internal relationship mechanisms based on integration, communication, and mutual support (which can facilitate assimilation and transformation of such knowledge) are more likely to adopt advanced technologies like BDA (Hallikas et al., 2021; Öhman et al., 2021; Rialti et al., 2019; Roβmann et al., 2018). Our endogeneity test revealed that the reverse causality (supported by prior literature such as Setia and Patel, 2013) only applies to assimilation and transformation capabilities. Thus, we conclude that, at least in the context of PSM, the successful implementation of BDA is contingent upon an organizational foundation of acquisition, transformation, and assimilation capabilities.When discussing the competitive advantage of using BDA for strategic PSM activities, our findings indicate that the overall (positive) impact on performance improvement results from the simultaneous coexistence of a direct and indirect effect, which supports our hypothesis H4 (Rialti et al., 2020; Roβmann et al., 2018). The adoption of BDA for strategic PSM activities, per se, provides a direct contribution to performance improvement. The adoption of BDA can help purchasing departments improve their performance by increasing efficiency, enhancing supplier management, improving negotiation outcomes, and providing real-time data and insights for agile decision-making. By leveraging BDA effectively, purchasing professionals can drive better results for their organizations (Arvidsson et al., 2021; Moretto et al., 2017). Due to the significant (positive) mediation effect of this variable, greater knowledge exploitation capabilities amplify the effect. This gives further hints on the role of BDA in strategic purchasing decisions. The adoption of BDA requires not only the implementation of appropriate technological infrastructure but also the development of appropriate knowledge management capabilities and competencies among the purchasing professionals. The knowledge exploitation capabilities of purchasing people are essential to fully leverage the potential of BDA for purchasing performance improvement. Only purchasing professionals who are well-versed in BDA and possess the necessary competencies and knowledge can use this high-quality data and information to make more informed strategic decisions that ultimately result in enhanced performance (Hallikas et al., 2021).While hypotheses H1 and H2 are applicable to both strategic and operational purchasing—highlighting the importance of acquisition, assimilation and transformation capabilities for the successful adoption of BDA for PSM activities (Ciampi et al., 2021)—H3 and H4 are invalid when BDA is used for operational PSM activities. These results are pertinent (and unique) in the context of SCM and BDA in general, as previous research on the interrelationship between BDA and operational activities may have suggested a positive interaction between BDA and operations improvement (Yu et al., 2022). We demonstrate empirically that, in the context of PSM, the use of BDA for operational activities has no positive relationship with either exploitation capabilities or the contribution of BDA to performance. These results shed additional light on the role of BDA in supporting SCM processes (PSM, in particular). PSM activities related to contract management, order management, logistics management, and invoice management generate data, but do not necessitate strategic or complex decisions that may require the use of advanced analytics techniques. Therefore, the improvement in knowledge management capabilities and performance resulting from the adoption of BDA in this area appears to be negligible (e.g., Arunachalam et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018). To summarize, exploration, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation capabilities are therefore essential to extract the power of the BDA technologies, as a tool to assist managers in the context of strategic purchasing decisions instead of supporting daily operational purchasing activities (Grover et al., 2018; Moretto et al., 2017). Nonetheless, this does not imply that businesses should only utilize BDA for strategic PSM activities. In organizations characterized by purchasing operations with a high degree of complexity and a large number of actors (such as hospitals or construction companies), the use of BDA can still be advantageous at the operational level due to their capacity to reduce the complexity of operational activities (e.g., Yu et al., 2022).Indeed, we show that in the context of PSM, the capabilities of acquisition, assimilation, and transformation function as antecedents for BDA, while BDA strengthens the exploitation capabilities of the companies as a result of their ability to support the strategic PSM decisions (Neirotti et al., 2021; Roβmann et al., 2018). Our research shows that businesses cannot just use BDA as a quick fix to boost PSM and supply chain performance; rather, they need to have the ability to integrate it into an environment, that in itself is flexible and ambidextrous (e.g., Patrucco et al., 2020, 2022b). By complementing existing business decision-making procedures, BDA improves procurement's ability to capitalize on opportunities (Patrucco et al., 2022a). Therefore, BDA will contribute more to performance enhancements, the more fully developed the exploitation capabilities of purchasing activities are (Difrancesco et al., 2022). Since technologies may not always be able to manifest an immediate benefit in terms of performance, this finding has theoretical relevance for BDA, SCM, and, more generally, innovation management. Our conclusion also holds true in settings where human beings and technological systems are highly interactive (Marzi et al., 2022). In this paper, we highlight the importance of further investigating how BDA interacts with the knowledge management capabilities already present within businesses (AlNuaimi et al., 2021).By re-examining the effect of BDA on performance from the perspective of AC (Rialti et al., 2019; Roβmann et al., 2018), this study adds to the existing body of literature on BDA and its role in facilitating managers’ decision-making with a special emphasis on SCM. We offer a theoretical perspective that has not been explored in previous research in the context of SCM, noting the function of BDA as a supporting tool that works in synergy with capabilities already developed internally by the companies. We also inform academics and industry professionals on the many ways in which BDA can boost performance, thereby clarifying the role it plays in facilitating day-to-day operations.Organizations need to ensure that they have the necessary infrastructure and tools in place to support the adoption and effective use of BDA. This may include investing in advanced analytics software, hardware, and data storage solutions, as well as ensuring that the organization's IT systems can support BDA initiatives.","Abbasi A., Albrecht C., Vance A., Hansen J., Metafraud: a meta-learning framework for detecting financial fraud, MIS Q., 36, pp. 1293-1327, (2012); Alharthi A., Krotov V., Bowman M., Addressing barriers to big data, Bus.

This study’s focus is on understanding how the customer voice, often communicated through online and social media platforms, is used in high-performing hotels. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a case study of four high-performing Irish hotels. For each case, multiple informants, including marketing managers, general managers and finance managers, were interviewed and shadowed. Twenty seven decisions across the four cases were analysed to assess the use of customer voice in managerial decision-making. Findings: Social media provides a stage that has empowered the customer voice because of the public nature of the interaction and the network effect. Customer voice is incorporated in managerial decision-making in three distinct ways – symbolically as part of an early warning system, for action-oriented operational decisions and to some extent in the knowledge-enhancing role for tactical decisions. While there is a greater appreciation among senior managers and the finance and accounting managers of the importance of customer voice, this study finds clear limits in its utilisation and more reliance on traditional finance and accounting data, especially in strategic decision-making. Research limitations/implications: The cases belong to a highly visible open environment of hotels in an industry where customer voice has immediate and strong effects. The findings may not directly apply to industries characterised by a relatively more closed context such as banking or insurance. Moreover, the findings reflect the practices of high-performing hotels and do not necessarily capture the practices used in less successfully operating hotels. Practical implications: While marketers need to enhance their ability to create a narrative that links the customer voice to revenue generation, finance managers also need to develop a skillset and adopt a mindset that appropriately reflects the influential role for customer voice in managerial decision-making. Originality/value: Despite the linkage of marketing performance to business performance, there is limited research on the impact of customer information on managerial decision-making. This research provides insight into how customer voice is considered at the critical marketing-finance interface. © 2022, Deepak Saxena, Mairead Brady, Markus Lamest and Martin Fellenz.","Big data; Customer voice;

However, designing suitable pricing for PSB is a non-trivial task that involves complex decision-making. This paper explores the significance of pricing optimization in the telecommunication industry, focusing on product-service bundling (PSB). It delves into the challenges associated with pricing PSB and highlights the transformative impact of big data analytics on decision-making for PSB strategies. The study presents a data-driven pricing optimization model tailored for designing appropriate pricing structures for product-service bundles within the telecommunication services domain. This model integrates customer preference knowledge and involves intricate decision-making processes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the paper conducts a case study encompassing two design scenarios, wherein the results reveal that the model offers competitive pricing compared to existing telecommunication service providers, facilitating PSB design and decision-making. The findings from the case study indicate that the data-driven pricing optimization model can significantly aid PSB design and decision-making, leading to competitive pricing strategies that open avenues for new market exploration and ensure business sustainability. By considering both product and service features concurrently, the proposed model provides a pricing reference for optimal decision-making.

Consequently, this research aims to use PLS-SEM to explain the interaction and relationships between the core user-centric performance measures of BDMA, such as user satisfaction, value for money and reinvestment intention. Also, the significance of the decision-making role was explored in this context. Finally, the impact of perceived financial performance was investigated to see its impact on the examined relationships. The impact of value for money on user satisfaction, the impact of the decision-making role on user satisfaction, and finally, the impact of the decision-making role on the reinvestment intentions were found to be significant for individuals who scored either low or high perceived financial performance. Furthermore, all the observed relationships in the dataset were positive, whereas only three were positive and significant for individuals who scored low on perceived financial performance. Overall, it is clear that perceived financial performance has a vital role in BDMA deployment, where understanding the influence of user authority in decision-making enables managers to design better organizational plans by integrating inputs from multiple organizational cross-layers. Also, the results indicate that a user’s decision-making role influences user-centric measures in BDMA deployment, which reveals how user perceptions and authority play a vital role in the context of BDMA in firms. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Abdel Fattah F.A.M., Dahleez K.A., Darwazeh R.N., Al Alawi A.M.M., Influence of service quality on consumer loyalty: A mediation analysis of health insurance, The TQM Journal, 33, 8, pp. 1787-1805, (2021);

Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, 30303, GA, United States","Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance. © 2016 University of Minnesota.

This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile targeting by investigating the effects of customer mobile habits and social capital on firm sales. Leveraging unique customer mobile browsing data from a major telecom service provider in China, we use a Bayesian SEM (structural equation modeling) approach to show that customer mobile habits and social capital exert significant influences on customers' purchase intentions. Specifically, customers who engage in more hedonic mobile behaviors, such as social networking, video browsing, and gaming are associated with a higher probability of purchasing, controlling for the usage of communications apps including messaging and emailing apps, and the usage of functional apps, such as maps, living services, and app market apps. Additionally, our research results reveal a significant positive effect of social capital on firms' sales performance. These findings offer important insights that are often missing from organizational targeting campaign designs in terms of targeting both the right customers and the right business alliance partners and enable a better understanding of managerial and decision-making implications in the context of the B2B market in general. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian SEM; Big data; Hedonic value; Mobile habits; Mobile targeting; Social capital","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71490722, 71802166)","The authors thank the editor and the reviewers for their valuable comments, which substantially improved this article.

To close this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capability view to posit that a firm can attain sustained competitive advantage from its sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities, which are manifested by the use of marketing analytics, marketing decision-making, and product development management. This study also examines the impact of the antecedents of marketing analytics use on marketing related processes. The analysis of a survey of 221 UK firm managers demonstrates: (a) the positive impact of marketing analytics use on both marketing decision-making and product development management; (b) the effect of the latter two on sustained competitive advantage; (c) the indirect effect of data availability on both marketing decision-making and production development management; and (d) the indirect effect of managerial support on marketing decision-making. The research model proposed in this study provides insights into how marketing analytics can be used to achieve sustained competitive advantage. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Dynamic capability view; Marketing analytics;

The purpose of this paper is to propose a multiple methods approach to elicit intelligence and value from big data by analysing the customer behaviour in mobile app usage. Design/methodology/approach - The big data analytical approach is developed using three data mining techniques: RFM(recency, frequency, monetary) analysis, link analysis, and association rule learning. The authors then conduct a case study to apply this approach to analyse the transaction data extracted from a mobile app. Findings - This approach can identify high value and mass customers, and understand their patterns and preferences in using the functions of the mobile app. Such knowledge enables the developer to capture the behaviour of large pools of customers and to improve products and services by mixing and matching the functions and offering personalised promotions and marketing information. Originality/value - The approach used in this study balances complexity with usability, thus facilitating corporate use of big data in making product improvement and customisation decisions. The approach allows developers to gain insights into customer behaviour and function usage preferences by analysing big data. The identified associations between functions can also help developers improve existing, and design new, products and services to satisfy customers' unfulfilled requirements. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data;

As a result, Web publishers are now facing a challenging decision of allocating the ad inventory across multiple advertising models, which has a direct and important influence on both their individual revenues, and the market-wide supply-demand balance. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF), taking into consideration the possible scenarios of ad inventory allocation in programmatic advertising markets. AIAF explicitly captures the specific features of ad inventory allocation in each of three levels (i.e., channel level, market level and platform level), and also their influence-feedback effects. We present the general solution process for solving this model on the basis of its property analysis. An illustrative instantiation of our AIAF model is formulated to demonstrate its applications in supporting publishers’ decision-making on the ad inventory allocation. We also conduct experiments based on empirical data so as to validate the model and analysis. Our research findings indicate that 1) our AIAF model outperforms other single-level and two-level allocation strategies; 2) the fine-grained optimization is superior to that of the coarse-grained level; 3) allocation decisions should be made on the basis of the comparative marginal revenue instead of the absolute marginal revenue. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ad inventory; Header bidding; Private marketplace; Programmatic advertising; Real-time bidding","Big data; Decision making; Marketing; Ad inventory; Advertising markets; Allocation decision; Header bidding; Inventory allocation; Private marketplace; Real time biddings; Supply-demand balances; Commerce","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61533019, 71472174, 71702182)","We gratefully acknowledge the funding supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71472174, #61533019, #71702182).","Adikari S., Dutta K., Real time bidding in online digital advertisement, New Horizons in Design Science: Broadening the Research Agenda, (2015); Agrawal S., Wang Z., Ye Y., A dynamic near-optimal algorithm for online linear programming, Oper.

Corporations have seen how consumers can share their experiences with products and services. Smart companies find ways to leverage these conversations to engage current and potential customers and other stakeholders. Design/methodological approach - Our approach is theoretical, based on an examination of how the communication channel of social media can be used as a strategic tool throughout the organization, going well beyond marketing. Findings - This chapter looks at four advantages of social media. Social media provides a mechanism for firms to not just find customers, but also allow customers to find firms. Social media can engage customers, industry influencers, and thought pundits in cost-effective ways that benefit both the firm and stakeholders. The largest contribution of social media is the information from big data on customer needs and wants as well as on the processes underlying consumer decisions. The greatest opportunity lies in how a firm converts data into actionable intelligence in real time. Practical applications - We discuss how the words, social and media, need to be de-coupled: The concept of social can be practically applied very effectively to areas of strategy and internal learning, and product development. Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by social media requires a social enterprise to be effective. Originality - This chapter presents an original theoretical framework of social media that can be used by a company to examine the social aspects and implications of every element in the value chain.

To further study the role of the Internet service platform, this paper considers a CLSC composed of a manufacturer, a retailer and an Internet service platform who invests in research and development (R&D), advertising and Big Data marketing, and develops the goodwill dynamic model based on the differential game theory. The construction of a goodwill dynamic model has two purposes, namely, to increase sales and the return rate. The optimal decisions for 3 players under two different cooperative scenarios are obtained, namely, the retailer payment scenario (scenario D) and the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario (scenario S). The supply chain members gain more profit or achieve a higher level of goodwill for products under certain conditions, i.e., a high residual value from remanufacturing, a high sharing rate of residual value from the retailer's recycled products, and a low recycling cost. Interestingly, the wholesale price increases with the residual value of recycled products when goodwill effectiveness is low, while the price declines when goodwill effectiveness is high. After comparing two cooperative scenarios, the result shows that an Internet service platform will invest more in Big Data marketing under the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario, and cooperation between the manufacturer and the Internet service platform can help improve the goodwill of enterprises or products. Moreover, the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario is payoff-Pareto-improving in most cases through the coordination of a cost-sharing rate, and the effectiveness of Big Data marketing exerts a positive effect on goodwill and the development of the industry. In addition, the retailer has “free rider” tendencies in the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario. The results encourage more enterprises to enhance the value of goodwill through cooperation with Internet service platforms because Internet service platforms conveniently utilize Big Data marketing to increase the sales of products and the collecting rate of used products, which in turn helps environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data marketing; Closed-loop supply chain; Differential game; Internet service platform","Big data; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Dynamic models; Game theory; Recycling; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Data marketing; Differential game theory; Differential games; Environmental sustainability; Internet services; Research and development; Web services","","","","","Project of Hunan Social Science Achievement Assessment Committee, (XSP17YBZC201); Special Project of Hunan Social Science Foundation for Think-Tank, (16ZWB40); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2015JJ2177); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (14BGL196)","This research was partially supported by National Social Science Foundation of China [Grant 14BGL196 ], the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [Grant 2015JJ2177 ], and Special Project of Hunan Social Science Foundation for Think-Tank [Grant 16ZWB40 ], Project of Hunan Social Science Achievement Assessment Committee [Grant XSP17YBZC201 ].

However, many are not clear on what are, or what is meant by the term, ‘Big Data’. The focus of this research was to explore the meaning of BD and to identify important paths of research on BD. As part of this process, we called upon a diverse set of marketing scholars who possess expertise and special insights. We discovered that different communities have different perspectives. It could be argued that they are all correct as they reflect the preferred perspectives of different communities. We find it helpful to think of BD as a term that represents a period of time or era, a process, and data that are from a variety of sources, of various structures or forms, and in a variety of locations. Important research questions and issues related to BD are discussed. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Big data; Marketing; Research opportunities","","","","","","Marketing Science Institute, MSI","received her doctorate in 2001 from the University of Cincinnati.

A segmentation index system of ETC customer consisting of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary is constructed and extracted using ETC data. The whole sample clustering analysis of ETC customer is accomplished by CLARA algorithm while overcoming the invalidation problem on big data clustering. The decision tree of ETC customer segmentation is finally built and transformed into a set of segmentation rules. The empirical results indicate that the proposed method has a better ability to analyze the traveling characteristics, present values and appreciation potentials for different classifications of ETC customers. It provides an innovative idea to implement precision marketing and make hierarchical discount rates for ETC customers. Meanwhile, it provides theoretical support to further increase of ETC customer scale and paying ratio, as improve decision-making level in expressway operation and management.

This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools, which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term ""marketing science value chain"" to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain.In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual - academic and practice - impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers. Fourth, we discover more recent trends and initiatives in the period 2004-2012, such as the increased importance of big data and the rise of digital and mobile communication, using the marketing science value chain as an organizing framework. © 2013 The Authors.","","","","","","","Erasmus Center for Marketing and Innovation; London Business School Centre for Marketing","We were inspired and supported by the Practice Prize Committee of the INFORMS Society for Marketing Science , the Marketing Science Institute (MSI) and the Institute for the Study of Business Markets (ISBM) in the execution of this work.

Strategic principles, underpinned by the understanding of cause-effect relationships, are rare. These findings point to exciting opportunities for future research, including increased attention on enabling promises made to tourists and development of strategic and research principles; increased use of experimental, quasi-experimental and longitudinal research designs, as well as unstructured qualitative designs; and an increased focus on the study of actual behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Big data; Marketing knowledge; Promise management; Tourism marketing; Tourism marketing knowledge grid","decision making; market conditions; qualitative analysis; tourism development; tourism market","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP110101347, DP120103352)","This study was funded by the Australian Research Council under the Discovery Grant Scheme (Project numbers DP110101347 and DP120103352 ).

It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies. We offer insights for market research practitioners and marketers alike, to ensure they are getting the best from their data for robust marketing decision-making. © Warc 2014 Warc Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Armstrong J.S., Significance tests harm progress in forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting, 23, 2, pp. 321-327, (2007); Baker L.F., Mudge J.F., Making statistical significance more significant, Significance, 9, 3, pp. 29-30, (2012); Barwise P., Good Empirical Generalizations, Marketing Science, 14, 3, pp. G29-G35, (1995); Barwise T.P., Ehrenberg A.S.C., Consumer beliefs and brand usage, Journal of the Market Research Society, 27, 2, pp. 81-93, (1985); Bird M., Channon C., Ehrenberg A.S.C., Brand image and brand usage, Journal of Marketing Research, 7, 3, pp. 307-314, (1970); Bound J.A., Ehrenberg A.S.C., Significant sameness, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 152, pp. 241-247, (1989); Dall'Olmo Riley F., Rink L., Harris P., Patterns of attitudes and behaviour in fragmented markets, Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Marketing Science, 4, pp. 62-91, (1999); Dall'Olmo Riley F., Ehrenberg A.S.C., Castleberry S.B., Barwise T.P., Barnard N.R., The variability of attitudinal repeat-rates, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 14, 5, pp. 437-450, (1997); Ehrenberg A.S.C., The problem of numeracy, The American Statistician, 35, 2, pp. 67-72, (1981); Ehrenberg A.S.C., A Primer in Data Reduction., (1994); Ehrenberg A.S.C., Empirical generalisations, theory, and method, Marketing Science, 14, 3, pp. G20-G28, (1995); Ehrenberg A.S.C., Statistical Or Practical Significance.

In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk. A case study of a mobile communication company is also presented to explain the proposed procedure, as well as to analyze its real performance and results. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

In spring 2010, a political debate television series was co-created by BBC Arabic and citizen producers, using social media tools. Based around interviews with prominent political and controversial public figures, the programme (G710) was broadcast weekly on satellite TV across the Middle East and the Arabic-speaking world. Combining collaborative ethnography with corporate ‘big data’ analysis, the research team followed the experiment from conception to premature closure. The article argues that the kinds of digital tools deployed in producing the programme, and used by BBC audience research to monitor user practices in real time, have become essential to corporate processes of BBC World Service governance and management procedures, business strategy, accountability measures, marketing practices and editorial decision-making. They act as change agents, presenting methodological problems and opportunities for the BBC's audience researchers and academic researchers, as well as symbolizing the contradictory logic of empowerment and surveillance. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

The purpose of this paper is to develop understanding of consumers online-generated contents in terms of positive or negative comments to increase marketing intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: The research focuses on the collection of 9,652 tweets referring to three fast fashion retailers of different sizes operating in the UK market, which have been shared among consumers and between consumer and firm, and subsequently evaluated through a sentiment analysis based on machine learning. Findings: Findings provide the comparison and contrast of consumers’ response toward the different retailers, while providing useful guidelines to systematically making sense of consumers’ tweets and enhancing marketing intelligence. Practical implications: The research provides an effective and systemic approach to accessing the rich data set on consumers’ experiences based the massive number of contents that consumers generate and share online and investigating this massive amount of data to achieve insights able to impact on retailers’ marketing intelligence. Originality/value: To best of the authors’ knowledge, while other authors tried to identify the effect of positive or negative online comments/posts/reviews, the present study is the first one to show how to systematically detect the positive or negative sentiments of shared tweets for improving the marketing intelligence of fast fashion retailers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big Data analytics; Consumer-generated contents; E-word of mouth communication; Fast fashion; Online consumer behaviour; User-generated contents (UGC)","","","","","","","","Barnes L., Lea-Greenwood G., Fast fashion in the retail store environment, International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management, 38, 10, pp. 760-772, (2010); Baum D., Spann M., The interplay between online consumer reviews and recommender systems: an experimental analysis, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 19, 1, pp. 129-162, (2014); Bilotta E., Pantano P., Artificial micro worlds part IV: models of complex self-reproducers, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 21, 6, pp. 1501-1521, (2011); Bradlow E.T., Gangwar M., Kopalle P., Voleti S., The role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing, Journal of Retailing, 93, 1, pp. 79-95, (2017); Chang S.W., Fan S.H., Cultivating the brand-customer relationship in Facebook fan pages: a study of fast-fashion industry, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 45, 3, pp. 253-270, (2017); Choi T.M., Hui C.L., Liu N., Ng S.F., Yu Y., Fast fashion sales forecasting with limited data and time, Decision Support Systems, 59, pp. 84-92, (2014); Chonacky N., Winch D., Maple, mathematics and Matlab: the 3M’s without the tape, Computing in Science and Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 8-16, (2005); Chong A.Y.L., Chang E., Liu M.J., Li B., Predicting consumer product demands via Big Data: the roles of online promotional marketing and online reviews, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 17, pp. 5142-5156, (2017); Cook S.C., Yurchisin J., Fast fashion environments: consumer’s heaven or retailer’s nightmare?, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 45, 2, pp. 143-157, (2017); Demmers J., Van Dolen W.M., Weltevreden J.W., Handling consumer messages on social networking sites: customer service or privacy infringement?, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 22, 1, pp. 8-35, (2018); Dindar M., Yaman N.D., #IUseTwitterBecause: content analytic study of a trending topic in Twitter, Information Technology and People, 31, 1, pp. 256-277, (2018); Ellonen H.-K., Wikstrom P., Jantunen A., Linking dynamic-capabilities portfolios and innovation outcomes, Technovation, 29, 11, pp. 753-762, (2009); Erkan I., Evans C., The influence of eWOM in social media on consumers’ purchase intentions: an extended approach to information adoption, Computers in Human Behavior, 61, pp. 47-55, (2016); Ersoy M., Akbulut Y., Cognitive and affective implications of persuasive technology use on mathematics instruction, Computers and Education, 75, pp. 253-262, (2014); Fan S., Lau R.Y., Zhao J.L., Demystifying Big Data analytics for business intelligence through the lens of marketing mix, Big Data Research, 2, 1, pp. 28-32, (2015); Fleisher C.S., Using open source data in developing competitive and marketing intelligence, European Journal of Marketing, 42, 7-8, pp. 852-866, (2008); Gensler S., Volckner F., Egger M., Fischbach K., Schoder D., Listen to your customers: insights into brand image using online consumer-generated product reviews, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 20, 81, pp. 112-141, (2015); Ghiassi M., Lee S., A domain transferable lexicon set for Twitter sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 106, pp. 197-216, (2018); Halvorsen K., Hoffmann J., Coste-Maniere I., Stankeviciute R., Can fashion blog function as a marketing tool to influence consumer behavior?

With the potential to be extracted for information, making this available for various purposes, big data transforms into a powerful tool for data controllers for effective marketing, defining strategic business decisions, and establishing a strong foothold in the market. The use of personal data for targeted marketing exemplifies this. While privacy has been subject to the regime of privacy protection, privacy violation might entangle competition law analysis when it involves abuse of market dominance. This paper addresses these problems by discussing three key issues: first, how competition law addresses the use of personal data as the new frontier of innovation and competition; second, whether big data plays a role to qualify dominance; and third, if non-negotiable policy on privacy infringes the prohibition of dominance abuse under competition law. © 2017, T.M.C.

From blogs to social media and online reviews, consumers generate a huge amount of brand-related information that has a decisive potential business value for marketing purposes. Particularly, we focus on online reviews that could have an influence on brand image and positioning. Within this context, and using the usual quantitative star score ratings, a recent stream of research has employed sentiment analysis (SA) tools to examine the textual content of reviews and categorize buyer opinions. Although many SA tools split comments into negative or positive, a review can contain phrases with different polarities because the user can have different sentiments about each feature of the product. Finding the polarity of each feature can be interesting for product managers and brand management. In this paper, we present a general framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, text data mining, and clustering techniques, to obtain new scores based on consumer sentiments for different product features. The main contribution of our proposal is the combination of price and the aforementioned scores to define a new global score for the product, which allows us to obtain a ranking according to product features. Furthermore, the products can be classified according to their positive, neutral, or negative features (visualized on dashboards), helping consumers with their sustainable purchasing behavior. We proved the validity of our approach in a case study using big data extracted from Amazon online reviews (specifically cell phones), obtaining satisfactory and promising results. After the experimentation, we could conclude that our work is able to improve recommender systems by using positive, neutral, and negative customer opinions and by classifying customers based on their comments. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Feature selection; Marketing decisions; Sentiment analysis","creative industry; data mining; decision making; marketing; media role; ranking; social media; sustainable development; valuation; World Wide Web","","","","","Conselleria de Educaci?n; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CloudDriver4Industry TIN2017-89266-R, PROMETEO/2018/089); Conselleria d'Educació, Investigació, Cultura i Esport, (AICO/2017/134)","Funding text 1: Funding: This study was partially funded by the ECLIPSE-UA (RTI2018-094283-B-C32) and RESCATA (TIN2015-65100-R) projects of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and PROMETEO/2018/089.

Although some authors have also discussed their relevance to purchasing and supply management, the literature on this topic remains scant. This paper aims to investigate the role of big data in supporting the procurement process and the implementation of procurement practices. The main benefits of such procurement practices for companies are highlighted. By presenting the results of a focus group of procurement professionals and experts and discussing four exploratory case studies (supported by secondary data analysis), the paper addresses 1) how (and in which format) big data affects different activities in the procurement process and 2) which benefits procurement professionals can expect from adopting big data. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

S1 was described by D. Kahneman as a spontaneous and automatic reaction by an unconscious way in which human decision-makers choose among multiple alternatives. Application of S1 can be seen as a simplified BWS for data eliciting and express analysis of prioritization between many compared items. In S1, a respondent picks the items with which she feels “happy”, and those can be one, several, all, or none items in a task. Estimation of utilities is performed by multinomial-logit modeling with different optimization criteria which produce parameters of the models and choice probabilities of the items. Numerical examples by marketing research data are encouraging and demonstrating that spontaneous choice decisions can make S1 approach very fast, efficient, and convenient for express analysis of items prioritization, especially for big data. © 2019, © 2019 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","BWS;

In this context, business analytics offer the opportunity to harness the knowledge and value hidden within enterprise information systems to revolutionize innovation, enhance supply chain management and production, accurately target marketing and sales efforts, as well as develop and manage profitable after-sales services. While the literature to date presents numerous specific applications in which business analytics techniques were successfully deployed to improve specific business units, it is evident that a comprehensive enterprise approach is missing. In the present work, a pathway to attain market leadership through the effective use of business analytics is defined suggesting focus must center on three increasingly challenging barriers. Firstly, “standardization” of collection, aggregation and storage of data must be accomplished. Then, an “organizational culture evolution” that outgrows intuition and embraces data-driven decision-making is needed to create the perfect ecosystem for business analytics to produce actionable results and recommendations. In turn, these must guide “business model innovation” efforts to tackle new value creation, and capture and secure market leadership. © 2019","Big data; Business analytics; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing","","","","","","AFR-PPP, (11601404); Luxembourg National Research Fund","This work was supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under an AFR-PPP for project INSIGHT ( 11601404 ).

A segmentation index system of ETC customers comprising Recency, Frequency, and Monetary is extracted and constructed using ETC data. The whole-sample clustering analysis of ETC customers is accomplished with the Clustering LARge Applications (CLARA) algorithm while overcoming the invalidation problem of big data clustering. A decision tree on ETC customer segmentation is constructed and transformed into a set of segmentation rules. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is better able to analyze travel characteristics and to present values and appreciation potentials for ETC customer classification. This method provides an innovative idea for implementing precision marketing and establishing hierarchical discount rates for ETC customers. Furthermore, it provides theoretical support to increase the ETC customer scale and payment ratio, thus improving the decision-making level in expressway operation and management. © 2018 Chao Qian et al.","","Cluster analysis;

Visualization and analysis of demand markets are significantly enhanced by the capabilities of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and help to support management objectives. This study implements traditional desktop GIS as well as a free, web-delivered decision-support tool for tourism planning and marketing to assess ~7.5 million overnight accommodation reservations made for federal recreational facilities between 1999 and 2007. Visitor origin frequency and median travel distance for overnight accommodations are summarized by visitor zip code and by facility. National results indicate: (1) facilities in the west, the Great Lakes and the southern Appalachians regions draw overnight visitors from the greatest median distances; (2) residents in the Northeast have the lowest per-capita utilization; (3) residents within the south-central Midwest and central-west Southern States have the highest percapita utilization and tend strongly toward local overnight reservations. Three selected national park regions are used to illustrate destinations characterized by highly localized utilization (Hot Springs National Park, AR), both local and regional utilization (Yosemite National Park, CA) and regionally to nationally dispersed utilization with few local residents reserving overnight accommodations (Canyonlands National Park, UT). Market profiling derived from local, regional and national customer origin markets can help any tourism destination, including national parks and their gateway communities, make smarter management and marketing decisions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Big data analytics; Destination marketing; Geospatial supply and demand; GIS; National parks and gateway communities; Open source","","","","","","College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University","This research was supported by a Hoffmann Fellowship from the College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University .","(2012); Bell R.R., Zabriskie N.B., Assisting marketing decisions by computer mapping: A branch banking application, Journal of Marketing Research, 15, 1, pp. 122-128, (2008); Chancellor C., Cole S., Using geographic information system to visualize travel patterns and market research data, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 25, 3, (2008); Chen R., Geographic information systems (GIS) applications in retail tourism and teaching curriculum, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 14, 4, pp. 289-295, (2007); Dragicevic S., Li S., Brovelli M., Veenendaal B., Pervasive web mapping, geoprocessing and services, Transactions in GIS, 15, 2, pp. 125-127, (2011); Elliott-White M.P., Finn M., Growing in sophistication: The application of geographical information systems in post-modern tourism marketing, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 7, 1, pp. 65-83, (1998); Frehner M., Brandli M., Virtual database: Spatial analysis in a web-based data management system for distributed ecological data, Environmental Modelling & Software, 21, 11, pp. 1544-1554, (2006); Grimshaw D.J., Bringing geographical information systems into business, (1999); Haklay M., Singleton A., Parker C., Web mapping 2.0: The neogeography of the Geoweb, Geography Compass, 2, 6, pp. 2011-2039, (2008); Hall G., Chipeniuk R., Feick R., Leahy M., Deparday V., Community-based production of geographic information using open source software and Web 2.0, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 24, 5, pp. 761-781, (2010); Hanink D.M., Stutts M., Spatial demand for national battlefield parks, Annals of Tourism Research, 29, 3, pp. 707-719, (2002); Hanink D.M., White K., Distance effects in the demand for wildland recreational services: The case of national parks in the United States, Environment and Planning A, 31, 3, pp. 477-492, (1999); Hicken J., From 0.3 to 81.1: What percentage of each state is owned by the federal government?, Deseret News, (2014); Kearns F., Kelly M., Tuxen K., Everything happens somewhere: Using webGIS as a tool for sustainable natural resource management, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 1, 10, pp. 541-548, (2003); Loomis J., How bison and elk populations impact park visitation: A comparison of results from a survey and a historic visitation regression model, Society & Natural Resources, 17, 10, pp. 941-949, (2004); MacEachren A.M., Crawford S., Akella M., Lengerich G., Design and implementation of a model, web-based, GIS-enabled Cancer Atlas, Cartographic Journal, 45, 4, pp. 246-260, (2008); Marrocu E., Paci R., They arrive with new information.

Our analysis was undertaken in firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE) from 2006 to 2015. We employed Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression after clustering the standard errors at the firm level in order to examine these relationships. The KEJI (Korea Economic Justice Institute) index was used as a proxy for CSR and a big data-based proxy estimated from multimedia was used as the level of advertising. We showed that there is a positive relationship between overconfident management and CSR activities. We then categorized the CSR activities as primary and social activities and found that overconfident management is more aggressive in primary CSR activities. In addition, overconfident management makes fewer CSR expenditures when the management is in a chaebol firm but promotes more CSR advertisement. This finding indicates that chaebol affiliation controls overinvestment in CSR activities but promotes CSR advertisements by overconfident managers. Similarly, we found consistent results with overconfident ownermanagers. Prior literature on CSR activities focuses on the impact of CSR activities on firm performance. In this paper, we elucidated the determinants of CSR activities, so that this research contributes to firms' decision-making about sustainable management. Our estimation of CSR variables with big data approaches will also guide future research on this issue. We expect our study to be used as a reference for decision-making by relevant authorities and stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; CEO; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Overconfidence","Korea; advertising; corporate social responsibility; decision making; governance approach; marketing; multimedia; multinational enterprise; regression analysis; stock market","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2019S1A5A2A01046153)","Funding: This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF−2019S1A5A2A01046153).","Bowen H.R., Social Responsibility of the Businessman, (1953); Kim D.J., Shim J.G., An empirical study on the relationship between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, J.

The viability of these ICs may be jeopardized by big data environments and inferior member participation. Therefore, community managers must address poor member participation, together with the data-rich environment. This study examines the viability of a proactive motivational email campaign to reduce inferior member participation using uplift modeling; it also explores optimal treatment characteristics, including message scope (untargeted versus targeted), message content (hedonic, cognitive, and social message), and member profile (self-interest–oriented and positive emotional writing style). The findings indicate that marketing decision makers should use proactive, targeted emails with cognitive motivational elements to mitigate inferior levels of member participation.

Cultivating online relationships—defined as relational exchanges that are mediated by Internet-based channels—presents firms with challenges and opportunities. In lockstep with exponential advancements in computing technology, a rich and ever-evolving toolbox is available to relationship marketers to manage customer relationships online, in settings including e-commerce, social media, online communities, mobile, big data, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality. To advance academic knowledge and guide managerial decision making, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of online relationship marketing in terms of its conceptual foundations, evolution in business practice, and empirical insights from academic research. The authors propose an evolving theory of online relationship marketing, characterizing online relationships as uniquely seamless, networked, omnichannel, personalized, and anthropomorphized. Based on these five essential features, six tenets and 11 corresponding propositions parsimoniously predict the performance effects of the manifold online relationship marketing strategies. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.","E-commerce; Mobile shopping; Online relationships; Online retailing; Online shopping; Relationship marketing; Relationship selling; Social media; Virtual assistants","","","","","","","","Custom Home Workouts App, Healthy Meal and Nutrition Plans, (2018); Developers to invest $2.5 billion in augmented reality in 2018; look for enterprise to drive smart glasses, (2013); Achen R.M., The influence of Facebook engagement on relationship quality and consumer behavior in the National Basketball Association, Journal of Relationship Marketing, 15, 4, pp. 247-268, (2016); Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Aguirre E., Mahr D., Grewal D., de Ruyter K., Wetzel M., Unraveling the personalization paradox: the effect of information collection and trust-building strategies on online advertisement effectiveness, Journal of Retailing, 91, 1, pp. 34-49, (2015); Andrews M., Luo X., Fang Z., Ghose A., Mobile ad effectiveness: hyper-contextual targeting with crowdedness, Marketing Science, 35, 2, pp. 218-233, (2016); Ansari A., Mela C.F., Neslin S.A., Customer channel migration, Journal of Marketing Research, 45, 1, pp. 60-76, (2008); Arli D., Bauer C., Palmatier R.W., Relational selling: past, present and future, Industrial Marketing Management, 69, pp. 169-184, (2018); Armerding T., The 17 Biggest Data Breaches of the 21St Century – Security Practitioners Weigh in on the 17 Worst Data Breaches in Recent Memory, (2018); Arora N., Dreze X., Ghose A., Hess J.D., Iyengar R., Jing B., Joshi Y., Kumar V., Lurie N., Neslin S., Sajeesh S., Su M., Syam N., Thomas J., Zhang Z.J., Putting one-to-one marketing to work: personalization, customization, and choice, Marketing Letters, 19, 3-4, pp. 305-321, (2008); Ascarza E., Ebbes P., Netzer O., Danielson M., Beyond the target customer: social effects of customer relationship management campaigns, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 3, pp. 347-363, (2017); Babic Rosario A., Sotgiu F., De Valck K., Bijmolt T.H.A., The effect of electronic word of mouth on sales: a meta-analytic review of platform, product, and metric factors, Journal of Marketing Research, 53, 3, pp. 229-297, (2016); Ballantine P.W., Martin B.A.S., Forming parasocial relationships in online communities, Advances in consumer research, 32, pp. 197-201, (2005); Banovic J., How Nike Use Social Media [Case Study], (2017); Barnes N.G., Griswold J., Use of popular tools remains constant as use of Instagram expands quickly among the 2016 Fortune 500, (2016); Bart Y., Shankar V., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

These log data can be utilized for the purpose of web marketing. The customers who purchase many product items are good customers, whereas the other customers, who do not purchase many items, must not be good customers even if they browse many items. If the attributes of good customers and those of other customers are clarified, such information is valuable as input for making a new marketing strategy. Regarding the product items, the characteristics of good items that are bought by many users are valuable information. It is necessary to construct a method to efficiently analyze such characteristics. This paper proposes a new latent class model to analyze both purchasing and browsing histories to make latent item and user clusters. By applying the proposal, an example of data analysis on an EC site is demonstrated.

We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: The number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments. We also discuss how to evaluate whether field experiments can help optimize other marketing decisions, such as selecting which products to advertise or promote. © 2015 INFORMS.","Big data; Field experiments; Promotions; Sparsity","Big data; Costs; Marketing; Cross product; Field experiment; Historical data; Marketing decision; Pricing decision; Promotions; Sparsity; Commerce","","","","","National Science Foundation, (CMMI-0856063, CMMI-1158658)","","Anderson E.T., Simester D.I., Are sale signs less effective when more products have them?, Marketing Sci, 20, 2, pp. 121-142, (2001); Anderson E.T., Simester D.I., Advertising in a competitive market: The role of product standards, customer learning, and switching costs, J.

A systematic literature method has been conducted to explore the current practices as well as aspects that can help farmer at field level for increasing production. This study reveals several technologies and practices in agriculture that are based on big data for taking right decision at right time in right way at the field level. The study reveals that use of agricultural big data technologies are still a low level and needs more investment for infrastructure establishment, related expertise, technological knowledge of farmers, attitude of adoption of technologies and awareness about the benefits of big data technologies. It also explores that application of big data technologies can help farmer to weather forecasting, crop selection, irrigation management, crop diseases and pest management, crop yield prediction, agricultural marketing, and agricultural policy decision. But farmer needs help from an expert team to implement the facilities at field level. The study argues that a commercial implementation of big data technologies requires government initiatives, private sector’s involvement and a public-private partnership to supply related facilities to farmers in time. © 2020, IJSTR.","Agricultural development; Digital agriculture; Digital farm; Precision agriculture; Smart agriculture; Smart farming; Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","Sagar B.M., N.

Big data has played critical role in many decision makings and forecasting domains such as recommendation systems, business analysis, healthcare, web display advertising, clinicians, transportation, fraud detection and tourism marketing. The rapid development of various big data tools such as Hadoop, Storm, Spark, Flink, Kafka and Pig in research and industrial communities has allowed the huge number of data to be distributed, communicated and processed. Big data applications use big data analytics techniques to efficiently analyze large amounts of data. However, choosing the suitable big data tools based on batch and stream data processing and analytics techniques for development a big data system are difficult due to the challenges in processing and applying big data. Practitioners and researchers who are developing big data systems have inadequate information about the current technology and requirement concerning the big data platform. Hence, the strengths and weaknesses of big data technologies and effective solutions for Big Data challenges are needed to be discussed. Hence, due to that, this paper presents a review of the literature that analyzes the use of big data tools and big data analytics techniques in areas like health and medical care, social networking and internet, government and public sector, natural resource management, economic and business sector. The goals of this paper are to (1) understand the trend of big data-related research and current frames of big data technologies; (2) identify trends in the use or research of big data tools based on batch and stream processing and big data analytics techniques; (3) assist and provide new researchers and practitioners to place new research activity in this domain appropriately. The findings of this study will provide insights and knowledge on the existing big data platforms and their application domains, the advantages and disadvantages of big data tools, big data analytics techniques and their use, and new research opportunities in future development of big data systems. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Big data analytics techniques;

The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Green hotels; Machine learning techniques; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neuro-fuzzy; Satisfaction; Sustainable development; TOPSIS","Malaysia; cluster analysis; data mining; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; service quality; sustainable development; World Wide Web","","","","","Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, (LYC18-02, Xq18A01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771156, 71971145)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71771156 and 71971145, and the 2018 Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, grant number Xq18A01 and LYC18-02","Rahman I., Reynolds D., The influence of values and attitudes on green consumer behavior: A conceptual model of green hotel patronage, Int.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefi t from this advantage if competition between fi nancial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about fi nancial products and an appropriate degree of data security. The rise of Big Data analyses in retail banking allows a more precise estimation of creditworthiness risk as well as a consumer’s willingness-to-pay, propensity to switch and responsiveness to marketing offers. This not only impacts on competition, it represents major challenges for policymakers, authorities and consumers alike. © 2016 Springer Verlag.

This is one of the first research articles to use a data mining tool—namely, decision trees—to analyze the behavior of inbound tourists for the purpose of effective future destination marketing in Japan. The research results of approximately 4,000 observations show that the main motivation for visitors’ future return is not driven by experiences had during their most current visit but rather by experiences anticipated in the future, such as visiting hot springs or immersing themselves in beautiful natural settings. The data mining method largely excludes the possibility of the intrusion of researcher subjectivity and is conducive to useful discoveries of certain visitor patterns in large data sets, providing governments and destination marketing organizations with additional tools to better formulate effective destination marketing strategies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","big data analysis; data mining; decision trees; Japan; quantitative destination marketing","Japan; data mining; marketing; quantitative analysis; tourism market; tourist destination","","","","","","","Ahmed Z.U., The Influence of the Components of a State’s Tourist Image on Product Positioning Strategy, Tourism management, 12, 4, pp. 331-340, (1991); Alegre J., Garau J., The Factor Structure of Tourist Satisfaction at Sun and Sand Destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 1, pp. 78-86, (2011); Apte C., Weiss S., Data Mining with Decision Trees and Decision Rules, Future Generation Computer Systems, 13, 2, pp. 197-210, (1997); Assaker G., Vinzi V.E., O'Connor P., Examining the Effect of Novelty Seeking, Satisfaction, and Destination Image on Tourists’ Return Pattern: A Two Factor, Non-linear Latent Growth Model, Tourism Management, 32, 4, pp. 890-901, (2011); Athiyaman A., Knowledge Development in Tourism: Tourism Demand Research, Tourism Management, 18, 4, pp. 221-228, (1997); Bajs I.P., Tourist Perceived Value, Relationship to Satisfaction, and Behavioral Intentions the Example of the Croatian Tourist Destination Dubrovnik, Journal of Travel Research, 54, 1, pp. 122-134, (2015); Baloglu S., McCleary K.W., US International Pleasure Travelers’ Images of Four Mediterranean Destinations: A Comparison of Visitors and Nonvisitors, Journal of Travel Research, 38, 2, pp. 144-152, (1999); Berry M.J., Linoff G., Mastering Data Mining, (2000); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., The Odds Ratio, British Medical Journal, 320, 7247, (2000); Brown T.J., Barry T.E., Dacin P.A., Gunst R.F., Spreading the Word: Investigating Antecedents of Consumers’ Positive Word-of-Mouth Intentions and Behaviors in a Retailing Context, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33, 2, pp. 123-138, (2005); Buhalis D., Information Technology as a Strategic Tool for Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Benefits Enhancement of Tourism at Destination Regions, Progress in Tourism and Hospitality Research, 3, 1, pp. 71-93, (1997); Buhalis D., Strategic Use of Information Technologies in the Tourism Industry, Tourism Management, 19, 5, pp. 409-421, (1998); Buhalis D., Tourism on the Greek Islands: Issues of Peripherality, Competitiveness and Development, International Journal of Tourism Research, 1, 5, pp. 341-358, (1999); Buhalis D., Marketing the Competitive Destination of the Future, Tourism Management, 21, 1, pp. 97-116, (2000); Buhalis D., Law R., Progress in Information Technology and Tourism Management: 20 Years on and 10 Years after the Internet—The State of eTourism Research, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 609-623, (2008); Campelo A., Aitken R., Gnoth J., Visual Rhetoric and Ethics in Marketing of Destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 1, pp. 3-14, (2011); Chang K., Chen M., Kuo N., Hsu C., Cheng Y., Applying Data Mining Methods to Tourist Loyalty Intentions in the International Tourist Hotel Sector, Anatolia: An International Journal of Tourism & Hospitality Research, 27, 2, pp. 271-274, (2016); Chen C.F., Tsai D., How Destination Image and Evaluative Factors Affect Behavioral Intentions?, Tourism Management, 28, 4, pp. 1115-1122, (2007); Chi C.G.Q., Qu H., Examining the Structural Relationships of Destination Image, Tourist Satisfaction and Destination Loyalty: An Integrated Approach, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 624-636, (2008); De Reyck B., Degraeve Z., Vandenborre R., Project Options Valuation with Net Present Value and Decision Tree Analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 184, 1, pp. 341-355, (2008); Duncan R., What Is the Right Organization Structure?

A review of big data usage in retail stores was conducted along with a document-based descriptive analysis of secondary data and further critical literature analysis. Decision making strategies and flow charts were used for the development of competitiveness methodology by referring to a case of a supermarket chain. Customer segmentation researchers analyse mainly the algorithms or behaviour pattern behind the clustering process; however, neither of them offers a proper strategy for implementing a realtime customer segmentation process inside the enterprise. Sustainable competitiveness advantage may be achieved by implementing the segmentation theory with concepts of data mining and internet of things (Iot). The process of developed data mining shows many ways for the enterprise to maximize competitiveness. However, time and large investments may be required to develop proper methods for unique solutions. A concrete case study of the selected retail store should be analysed before implementing the real-time customer segmentation methodology inside the enterprise. There is a multicultural population in every market that has different culture, beliefs, preferences and shopping patterns; therefore, constant analysis is essential for efficient usage of customer segmentation. Practically none of the prior research results carried out by other authors offered a concrete methodology how to implement real-time customer's segmentation inside the enterprise. The authors created such a methodology that can provide sustainable long-term competitiveness advantage.","Big data concept; Competitiveness; Customer segmentation; Marketing; Retail sales","","","","","","","","Brito P.Q., Soaresb C., Almeidab S., Montea A., Byvoetc M., Customer segmentation in a large database of an online customized fashion business, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 36, 1, pp. 93-100, (2015);

Technological improvements have greatly increased the ability to gather customer data, which elevates the roles of the CMO and CIO while increasing their dependence on each other. The research on the relationship between senior executives outside of that with the CEO is limited; this paper fills that gap by exploring CMO/CIO cooperation. To analyze the dynamics of the CMO/CIO relationship, this research introduces a conceptual framework that captures three antecedents of cooperation: interdependence, CMO/CIO relationship structure, and CMO/CIO diversity. In cases in which dependence between the two executives is asymmetric, this paper proposes four cooperation mechanisms expected to mediate the relationship between these individual and organizational level antecedents and CMO/CIO cooperation. When the two executives cooperate, it leads to strategically aligned decision-making that increases business performance by integrating technology, data, and the customer into strategic decision-making. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data;

This article shows, however, that advertisers and marketers who are taking up ideas and techniques from behavioral economics tell their clients a very different story about the aims and use of digital marketing and consumer surveillance. Listening in on this discourse demonstrates that some digital marketers conceptualize their own practices as forms of social control, appropriating concepts from behavioral economics to identify consumers’ cognitive and affective biases and target their vulnerabilities. Behavioral economics recognizes that economic decisions are not simply dictated by rational self-interest; rather, such choices depend on cognitive heuristics and habits, and can be manipulated through the design of “choice architecture.” This article discusses implications of the behavioral turn in data-driven marketing for critical advertising scholars, public advocates, and regulators. © 2017 National Communication Association.","Behavioral economics;

Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is able to increase the classification accuracy of several existing works based on RNN models for sentiment analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; BiLSTM; FastText; GRU; LSTM; Natural language processing;

Making use of this data is commonly done with machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost. This knowledge permits a company to focus marketing efforts on such clients as early as three months in advance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Client retention; Machine learning; Prepaid unitary services; Sales forecasting","corporate strategy; data set; experimental study; forecasting method; industrial performance; machine learning","","","","","","","Ali O.G., Ariturk U., Dynamic churn prediction framework with more effective use of rare event data: the case of private banking, Expert Syst.

Managers use the term “Big Data” to describe this avalanche of information, which many view as critical to providing a better understanding of customers and markets. This research uses interviews with managers to examine the marketing function’s perspective on data-driven decision making within the firm. Based on informant responses, we develop a hierarchy of data-oriented decision making, describe the drivers that influence where a firm falls within this hierarchy, and detail several transition capabilities for marketing managers interested in becoming more data-driven. The key factors that influence the level of data driven decision making are: 1) firm environment; 2), competition, 3) executive commitment, 4) interdepartmental dynamics, and 5) organizational structure. This framework guides marketing managers both in evaluating the firm’s data capabilities and facilitating change. © 2019, Academy of Marketing Science.","Big data; Big data hierarchy; Data-driven decision making;

Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

The study is realised as a combination of analysing previous literature and applying a media monitoring tool to analyse editorial publications and social media to gain brand-related media sentiment. The potential of opinion mining and the use of vast amounts of data are demonstrated. The results indicate that sentiment analysis based on big data has potential for automating the calculation of brand indices. It seems that big data can be used to compare brands and the nature of their media visibility. Marketing research and the analytics domain can benefit from big data and their related meaningful applications. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Big data; Brand image; Brand index; Data-driven decision-making; Marketing analytics; Media sentiment; Opinion mining","","","","","","","","Ahmeddanti S.A., A novel approach for sentimental analysis and opinion mining based on SentiWordNet using web data, In Proceedings of the Trends in Automation, Communications and Computing Technology (I-TACT-15), pp. 1-5, (2015); Ball L., Elworthy J., Fake or real?

The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Big data; Conjoint analysis;

The Internet has influenced communication and boosted new technologies, which have advanced dramatically in the first three decades of the twenty-first century. This has had an impact on the various economic activities, among which tourism is particularly salient. Consequently, consumers no longer have a receptive role. They have become decision makers with respect to the media material that they consume in addition to having the opportunity of being information providers. Mexico City (CDMX), as a tourism segment, is no exception. It depends on the communication of public and private actors, who, while having certain methodologies and tools to access their audiences, interact with an audience that decides on what it receives and gives its opinion on the web. Therefore, the objective of the research is to assess the associated concepts, pages and organizations related to tourism in CDMX on the website aimed at both a domestic and international audience, designed by the government and private sector together with the input of the audience as an information provider. Likewise, the study seeks to determine the countries with the greatest interest in Mexico City as a tourist destination, since this can be highly important for directing the marketing strategies. The methodology used to explore the phenomenon takes a documentary and quantitative form, since in a first stage it includes the documentary analysis and subsequently makes the mathematical exploration through the use of network analysis (ARS) to assess the role of Big data and Smart Data in the CDMX brand before the fragmentation of audiences. © 2020 Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Turisticas.

It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

Recent research has shown that 20-25 per cent of the US adult population are willing to share their personal data with marketers they ‘trust’. The marketing challenge thus becomes how to identify these willing ‘data sharers’. Using a widely available data set, this study illustrates several ‘Big Data-based’ segmentation methodologies to screen this important segment out of the general population, ranging from factor analysis to chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) decision trees. The results of these analyses identify some unexpected potential segments among these ‘data sharer’ groups, most notably young men who participate in team sports. Thus, the paper argues that rather than looking at privacy regulation as a burden, marketers might well consider it a key element in their toolbox. © 2020, Henry Stewart Publications.

However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","customer knowledge management; data mining; fast-cycle industry; product development","Commerce; Competition; Decision trees; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Planning; Product development; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Apriori algorithms; Competitive advantage; Customer knowledge; Customer knowledge management; Data-driven methods; Innovative product development; Knowledge-based approach; Marketing strategy; Data mining","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71525005, 71821002)","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71525005, #71821002).

Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings: Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers’ decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications: In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model. Originality/value: The change in consumer behavior leads to a change in the service marketing approach needed in the world of AI. The bot, the new service platform is now in charge of search and choice for many purchase situations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial Intelligence; Big data; Bots; Consumer decision-making; Customer experience; Customer service; Robotics; Service experience; Service platforms; Service strategy; Services marketing","","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J.C., Curley S.P., Zhang J., Do recommender systems manipulate consumer preferences?

Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence.

These changes are emerging from transformations in management skills, technological innovations, and continuously evolving customer behavior. But perhaps the most substantial driver of these changes is the emergence of big data and the analytical methods used to examine and understand the data. To continue being relevant, marketing research must remain as dynamic as the markets themselves and adapt accordingly to the following: Data will continue increasing exponentially; data quality will improve; analytics will be more powerful, easier to use, and more widely used; management and customer decisions will increasingly be knowledge-based; privacy issues and challenges will be both a problem and an opportunity as organizations develop their analytics skills; data analytics will become firmly established as a competitive advantage, both in the marketing research industry and in academics; and for the foreseeable future, the demand for highly trained data scientists will exceed the supply. © 2018 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

In addition, all this data can also be used to provide new media services and to take media business decisions, and journalists need new skills related to data for these tasks. Taking into account these areas of knowledge required by journalists for the use of data, we perform a structured literature review (SLR) followed by a content analysis.

Users' activities on the hotel's website on yearly, monthly, daily and hourly basis are examined and compared, demonstrating the power of informatics and data analytics. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 29,976 hourly Weblog files from 1 August 2014 to 31 December 2017 were collected from a luxury hotel in Hong Kong. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons were used to analyse the data. Findings: Users' browsing behaviours, particularly stickiness, on the hotel website differ on yearly, monthly, daily and weekly bases. Users' activities increased steadily from 2014 to 2016, but dropped in 2017. Users are most active from July to September, on weekdays, and from noon to evening time. The month-, day-, and hour-based behaviours changed through years. The analysis of big data determines strategic and operational management and marketing decision-making. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the usage patterns of their websites allow organisations to make a range of strategic, marketing, pricing and distribution decisions to optimise their performance. Fluctuation of website usage and level of customer engagement have implications on customer support and services, as well as strategic partnership decisions. Originality/value: Leveraging the power of big data analytics, this paper adds to the existing literature by performing a comprehensive analysis on the temporal dynamics of users' online browsing behaviours. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Browsing activity; Hotel website; Strategic and tactical management; Temporal analysis; Weblog data; Website stickiness","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Commerce; Decision making; Dynamics; Hotels; Informatics; Marketing; Websites; Browsing behaviour; Comprehensive analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Marketing decision; Marketing strategy; Operational management; Post hoc comparisons; Strategic partnership; Data Analytics","","","","","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","This study is supported by a research grant funded by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Since then, brand experience has emerged as one of the solid academic constructs for branding and marketing scholars and practitioners who pursue this competitive strategy for sustainable growth in corporate management. The authors explore the new dimensions of brand experience with big data analytics for the first time in academic research. We propose a possible sixth dimension (""External"") of brand experience which includes sensory, affective, intellectual, behavioral, and social aspects drawn from previous studies. A new methodology for combining topic modeling and conjoint analysis is tested with big data-based multi-level compositions that overcome the limits of the traditional survey-based analysis. Moreover, the study reveals the decision-making frame which combines conjoint analysis and the dimensions of brand experience for practical implications. The novelty of this data-driven research and results contribute to new approaches in academia from the perspectives of brand experience dimensions, topic modeling, and conjoint analysis methodology development. Building sustainable brands, this study contributes to the ways of reading consumer behavior, evaluating the current status of the market and deciding the stimuli to affect consumer behavior. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data analysis; Brand experience; Brand experience dimensions; Conjoint analysis; Sustainable branding; Topic modeling","academic performance; academic research; consumption behavior; methodology; modeling; sustainability","","","","","","","Lewnes A., Keller K.L., 10 principles of modern marketing, MIT Sloan Management Review, 3 April, (2019); Pine B.J., Gilmore J.H., Welcome to the experience economy, Harv Bus.

Actors in different enterprises worked feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital data will give objective insight into human relations and provide authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of communication and social shaping of database and data mining technologies in the institutional context of genome science to understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with biological, physical, and big data. We found a rise in the use of racial discourse that suggests race has a genetic foundation. © 2013 (Peter A. Chow-White & Sandy E.

It evolves the business logic of online ad-delivery from buying “ad-impressions” in websites or ad slots to directly buying the best-matched “target audiences”, and thus can help advertisers achieve the precision marketing. As a critical part of RTB advertising markets, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) play a central role in matching advertisers with their target audiences via cookie-based data analysis and market segmentation, and their segmentation strategies (especially the choice of granularity) have key influences in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RTB advertising markets. Based on a mathematical programming approach, this paper studied DSPs’ strategies for market segmentation, and established a selection model of the granularity for segmenting RTB advertising markets. With the computational experiment approach, we designed three experimental scenarios to validate our proposed model, and the experimental results show that: 1) market segmentation has the potential of improving the total revenue of all the advertisers; 2) with the increasing refinement of the market segmentation granularity, the total revenue has a tendency of a rise first and followed by a decline; 3) the optimal granularity of market segmentation will be significantly influenced by the number of advertisers on the DSP, but less influenced by the number of ad requests. Our findings show the crucial role of market segmentation on the RTB advertising effect, and indicate that the DSPs should adjust their market segmentation strategies according to their total number of advertisers. Our findings also highlight the importance of advertisers as well as the characteristics of the target audiences to DSPs’ market segmentation decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Computational experiment; Demand Side Platforms; Market segmentation; Real Time Bidding","Big data; Computation theory; Data handling; Economics; Information analysis; Marketing; Mathematical programming; Advertising markets; Computational advertisings; Computational experiment; Demand-side; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Market segmentation; Precision marketings; Real time; Commerce","","","","","SKLMCCS, (Y6S9011F4G, Y6S9011F4H); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61233001, 61533019, 71232006, 71472174)","We gratefully acknowledge funding support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 71472174, 61533019, 71232006, 61233001) and the Early Career Development Award of SKLMCCS (Y6S9011F4G, Y6S9011F4H).","Bergemann D., Bonatti A., Targeting in advertising markets: implications for offline versus online media, The RAND J.

The authors critically evaluate the implications of these changes for the role of marketers and the organizational function of marketing. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses qualitative methods. Key-informant interviews are conducted among senior organizational practitioners within client-side organizations, digital agencies and strategic marketing consultancies, seeking to contrast their views. Findings: The findings reveal an erosion of responsibility for the integrated strategic role of marketing decision-making. In particular, the authors reveal that the evolving digital landscape has precipitated a sense of crisis for marketers and the role of marketing within the firm. This extends beyond simply remedying a skills-gap and is triggering a transformation that has repercussions for the future of marketing and its practice, thus diminishing functional accountability. Research limitations/implications: The findings have long-term implications for marketing as a strategic organizational function of the firm and for marketing as a practice. Originality/value: The study considers an increasingly digitalized marketplace and the associated impact of big data for the function of marketing. It reveals the changing scope of strategic marketing practice and functional accountability. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analytics; Big data; Digitalization; Target-Market strategy","","","","","","Digital Social Research programme; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Economic and Social Research Council, Digital Social Research programme in funding this project.","Alvesson M., Beyond neopositivists, romantics, and localists: a reflexive approach to interviews in organizational research, Academy of Management Review, 28, 1, pp. 13-33, (2003); Anderson P., Marketing, strategic planning, and the theory of the firm, Journal of Marketing, 46, 2, pp. 15-26, (1982); Arndt J., The tyranny of paradigms: the case for paradigmatic pluralism in marketing, Changing the Course of Marketing: Alternative Paradigms for Widening Marketing Theory, pp. 3-25, (1985); Bainbridge J., No time wasters, The Marketer, pp. 29-33, (2009); Baker S., Learning, and profiting, from online friendships, Bloomberg Businessweek Magazine, (2009); Ball K., Haggerty K., Editorial: doing surveillance studies, Surveillance and Society, 3, 2-3, pp. 129-138, (2005); Bartels R., The identity crisis in marketing, Journal of Marketing, 38, 4, pp. 73-76, (1974); Barwise P., Farley J., The state of interactive marketing in seven countries: interactive marketing comes of age, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 19, 3, pp. 67-80, (2005); Berger D., Balancing consumer privacy with behavioural targeting, Santa Clara High Technology Law Journal, 27, 1, pp. 3-61, (2010); Bonoma T.V., Making your marketing strategy work, Harvard Business Review, 62, 2, pp. 69-76, (1984); Boyd D., Crawford K., Big questions for big data: provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Information, Communication and Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Boyd E.D., Chandy R.K., Cunha M., When do chief marketing officers affect firm value?, Journal of Marketing Research, 47, 6, pp. 1162-1176, (2010); Brady M., Saren M., Tzokas N., Integrating information technology into marketing practice – The IT reality of contemporary marketing practice, Journal of Marketing Management, 18, 5-6, pp. 555-577, (2002); Brodie R.J., Winklhofer H., Coviello N.E., Johnston W.J., Is e-marketing coming of age?

The use of Big Data technologies to analyze the growing amount of data available in the globalized virtual world offers a new insight into the market and can contribute to the future of organizations by providing quality information that will strongly support the decision-making. In this scenario of high competitiveness, considering the context of data analysis, using Big Data technologies can broaden the view of companies to market trends, favoring the identification of strategies better targeted to the behavioral profiles and consumption preferences. This research aims to investigate how the use of Big Data technologies can increase the relationship marketing capacity of organizations, adding value to the business. The results demonstrate that organizations which make use of Big Data technologies are in a better position to define their relationship marketing strategies with customers, resulting in more lasting relationships with the market and their customers and capture favorable returns to their business. In the near future, the use of Big Data to expand relationship marketing strategies will be the survival rules for organizations. The differentiation will be in the way managers will interpret the available information and act to achieve the desired results. © 2016 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Literature review; Management research","Information management; Business and management; Data-driven approach; Integrated frameworks; Literature reviews; Management domains; Management research; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Science disciplines; Big data","","","","","","","Abrahams A., Fan W., Wang G., Zhang Z., Jiao J., An integrated text analytic framework for product defect discovery, Prod.

Weather data have long been considered a crucial external data input in practitioners’ marketing strategy; however, academic research on how weather conditions affect consumer behaviors has been limited. To fill this gap, this research investigates how weather parameters, including sunlight, temperature, and air quality, can be incorporated into MDSS to predict consumers’ variety-seeking in their purchases using public weather data and supermarket panel data for five typical retail products. Our analyses show that weather conditions are associated with greater variety-seeking behavior. The results afford insights into how to exploit weather data for data analytics and employ weather targeting strategies to save promotional expenses and increase profitability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China big data; Data analytics; Marketing decision support system; Mehrabian-Russell model; Variety-seeking; Weather data","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Decision support systems; Marketing; Meteorology; Academic research; Business effectiveness; Data analytics; Marketing decision; Marketing strategy; Variety-seeking; Weather data; Weather parameters; Big data","","","","","China Ministry of Education-China, (20150402); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71471021, 71702103)","This work was supported by China Ministry of Education-China Mobile research grant (#MCM20150402), and National Science Foundation of China (grant #71471021 and 71702103 ).

Differences in customers’ opinions based on gender and location are discussed. Sentiment analysis was used to analyze customers’ social media behavior in terms of liking, rating, and reviewing restaurants. User-generated reviews and comments about experiences influence potential customers’ decisions. The results of this study show that gender and location of customers influence restaurant ratings. This article shows that sentiment analysis (using Natural Language Toolkit and TextBlob) can help marketers by providing a useful tool for big data analysis.

However until now, the purpose of utilizing social media for the service business sector has not been widely verified empirically in various studies, making some managers view that social media is not an effective means of promotion for service businesses. Adverse decisions can be made because of lack of information about the benefits of social media for marketing. This article attempts to analyze the extent to which companies are capable of using social media as a basis for marketing excellence. This study provides reliable constructs of utilization of social media marketing in order it can be useful information and materials of information decisions making for managers in hospitality industries. The sample in this study consists of 177 general managers and marketing managers in three to five star hotels in Jakarta based on data from the Jakarta Statistic Center in 2016 and the Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association (PHRI). Statistical test results show that the constructs of utilization of social media marketing includes means of retaining customers, customer improvement effectiveness, actively communicating with customers, intensively attracting customers, and proactively capturing customers. These results can implicitly direct and make the right decisions on the ways that service organizations can use social media as the main source of big data information. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.","Customer improvement effectiveness; Information based decision making; Intensive communication; Service business; Social media marketing","","","","","","","","Mohammadpour A., Arbatani T., Gholipour T., Farzianpour F., Hosseini S., A survey of the effect of social media marketing on online shopping of customers by mediating variables, Journal of Service Science and Management, 7, 5, pp. 368-376, (2014); Amis R., You can't ignore social media: How to measure Internet efforts to your organization's best advantage, Public Relations Tactics, 14, 5, (2007); Awolusi F., The impacts of social networking sites on workplace productivity.

The most important megatrend is the digitalisation, which triggers a whole new economic revolution, so called ‘fourth industrial revolution’. In the situation with the new data source, new technological means for harvesting and processing of data, digitalisation and fourth economic revolution is very relevant not only for the operation but the marketing function as well. Social media represent an excellent source of data and channel of communication with the customer. Marketing spending on digital media platform soon will be no. 1, and it will overtake TV as the dominant marketing channel. Introducing the big data analytical capabilities, adjustment of overall organisation scheme and hiring competent personnel, the company will be in a position to save money for marketing spending, but in same time overall marketing performances will increase. Introducing big data analytical capabilities and efficient use of available social media platform is a challenging task that lay ahead of senior executives.

Drawing on research with British police, we contextualize these algorithmic processes within actual police practices, focusing on protest policing. Although aspects of algorithmic decision-making have become prominent in police practice, our research shows that they are embedded within a continuous human–computer negotiation that incorporates a rooted claim to ‘professional judgement’, an integrated intelligence context and a significant level of discretion. This context, we argue, transforms conceptions of threats. We focus particularly on three challenges: the inclusion of pre-existing biases and agendas, the prominence of marketing-driven software, and the interpretation of unpredictability. Such a contextualized analysis of data uses provides important insights for the shifting terrain of possibilities for dissent. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Big data; dissent; predictive policing; protest; social media","","","","","","Media Democracy Fund; Open Society Foundations Sometimes referred; Ford Foundation; Open Society Foundations","Funding text 1: This article is based on the project ‘Managing “Threats”: Uses of Social Media for Policing Domestic Extremism and Disorder in the UK’ funded by the Media Democracy Fund, the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations Sometimes referred to as ‘big social data’ (cf.

Unstructured data in Social media can provide useful insights into social phenomena and citizen opinions, both of which are critical to government policy and businesses decisions. Teachers of business intelligence and analytics commonly use quantitative data from sales, marketing, finance and manufacturing to demonstrate various analytics concepts in a business context. However, researchers have seldom used social media data to analyze social behavior and communication. In this study we aim to demonstrate an assessment structure for teaching social media analytics concepts with the goal of analyzing and interpreting social media content. We base this assessment on forum postings regarding two recent events: the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The aim of the assessment is to discover social insights. We base the assessment structure on Cooper's Analytics Framework to cover such concepts as term frequency (TF), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), data visualization, sentiments and opinions analysis, the Nearest Neighbor K-NN classification algorithm, and Information Diffusion theory. We review how the students performed on the assignment that used this assessment, and we make recommendations for future studies. © 2015 by the Education Special Interest Group (EDSIG) of the Association of Information Technology Professionals.","Data analytics; Social behavior; Social media; Text processing","Classification (of information); Data visualization; Disasters; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Information retrieval systems; Pattern recognition; Social networking (online); Teaching; Text processing; Data analytics; Earthquake and tsunamis; Information diffusion; K-NN classifications; Social behavior; Social media; Social media analytics; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies; Big data","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Social Media Analytics, (2012); Bell C., Mills R., Fadel K., An Analysis of Undergraduate Information Systems Curricula: Adoption of the IS 2010 Curriculum Guidelines, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 32, 1, (2013); Chen H.C., Chiang R.H.L., Storey V.C., Business Intelligence and Analytics: From Big Data to Big Impact, MIS Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012); Chiang R.H.L., Goes P., Stohr E.A., Business Intelligence and Analytics Education, and Program Development: A Unique Opportunity for the Information Systems Discipline, ACM Trans.

Smith School of Business of University of Maryland, College Park, United States; Sun B., Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business Americas, New York, United States","Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

The results of the literature review are then used to offer innovative solutions for the distribution needs of a new sales channel of a major soft drink multinational enterprise in Ecuador, Latin America. The objectives of this study are achieved through the use of two methodologies: The Literature Review Methodology for Scientific and Information Management, through its structuring and systematization; and the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodology, with the integration of marketing and market segmentation concepts for the determination of an existing local opportunity. The literature review shows that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) uses technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and Big Data to analyze, control and manage data that allows an efficient flow of information for decision-making purposes. ICT enables smart cities and smart factories to develop flexibility and quick adaptation to market changes, as well as to generate green logistic practices that comply with environmental regulations. Regarding the case study, the present study starts by analyzing the market needs for the implementation of the sales channel ""At Work"" for a multinational company dedicated to the production and distribution of soft drinks. Finally, the study presents innovative alternatives for distribution, focused on the results of the literature review, in order to optimize the delivery of soft drinks to the final customer of the ""At Work"" sales channel. © 2020, Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft fur Technische Logistik.

Data analysis is quite complex due to its enormous volume and its high generation speed. Big Data has many business applications such as in promotion, marketing either financially or by supporting in decision making. One such application is the sentiment analysis that paves the way for the business analysts to know the positive or negative impact over the product based on the tweets by the people. We propose a three-level text classifier with the first level as principal components analysis (PCA) followed by the support vector machine (SVM) and the conditional random fields (CRF) as the second and third level using the tweets collected. This feedback analyser would promote the sales of the product due to its high accuracy in feedback classification.

Sentiment Analysis in social media plays a vital role in monitoring of public opinion behind certain topics. Actually 92% of marketing professionals thought that social media has intense effect on their business. By doing an accurate sentiment analysis, winning might not be an impossible thing. Success does not depend only in the number of likes, comments or followers. It also depends in how much positive discussions have been held among the users of social media. The objective of this paper is to build a model that performs multi-class classification of Big data with improved accuracy. The proposed model uses a hybrid of Lexicon-based approach and Machine Learning based approach. In this paper, we have performed the sentiment analysis on the three Central Government Schemes namely Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Make-in India. The Apache Spark’s Machine Learning library, MLlib has been used in order to achieve better results in sentiment analysis for the Big Data. The AFINN dictionary was used to label the tweets and bigrams feature set was used. The Hashing TF-IDF method was used to extract the feature vectors from the raw feature set. These vectors were classified by Random Forest classifier to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments of tweets. The result from this model was tested by using the various testing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-score. The higher accuracy of 89.27% was obtained. © 2020, Research Trend.

We give an overview of the market structure and competitive submarket literature and then describe a classic model for testing competitive submarkets along with associated extensions. In the era of big data and with the increasing availability of large-scale consumer purchase data, there is a need for techniques that can interpret these data and use them to help make managerial decisions. We introduce a statistical likelihood based technique for both identifying and testing market structure. We run a series of experiments on generated data and show that our method is better at identifying market structure from brand substitution data than a range of methods described in the marketing literature. We introduce tools for holdout validation, complexity control, and testing managerial hypotheses. We describe a method for visualization of submarket solutions, and we give several traditional consumer product examples and in addition give an example to show how market structure can be analyzed from online review data. © 2016 INFORMS.","Big data; Brand switching; Cluster analysis; Likelihood estimation; Market segmentation; Market structure; Submarket analysis; Visualization","","","","","","","","Ailawadi K.L., Keller K.L., Understanding retail branding: Conceptual insights and research priorities, J.

Applying a multiple-case study analysis, the paper explores a set of regional tourist experiences related to a Southern European region and destination, to derive patterns and opportunities of value creation generated by Big Data in tourism. Findings present and discuss evidence in terms of improving decision-making, creating marketing strategies with more personalized offerings, transparency and trust in dialogue with customers and stakeholders, and emergence of new business models. Finally, implications are presented for researchers and practitioners interested in the managerial exploitation of Big Data in the context of information-intensive industries and mainly in Tourism. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Big Data; Business analytics; Decision making; Smart tourism destination; Social media measurement; Value creation","Decision making; Marketing; Business analytics; Information-intensive industries; Multiple-case study; New business models; Smart tourism destination; Social media; Value creation; Value creation process; Big data","","","","","","","Alberghini E., Cricelli L., Grimaldi M., A methodology to manage and monitor social media inside a company: A case study, Journal of Knowledge Management, 18, 2, pp. 255-277, (2014); Ambrosini V., Bowman C., What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?, International Journal of Management Reviews, 11, 1, pp. 29-49, (2009); Albino V., Berardi U., Dangelico M.R., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance and initiatives, Journal of Urban Technology, 22, 1, pp. 3-21, (2015); Bello-Orgaz G., Jung J.J., Camacho D., Social big data: Recent achievements and new challenges, Information Fusion, 28, pp. 45-59, (2016); Bharadwaj A., El Sawy O.A., Pavlou P.A., Venkatraman N.V., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Boes K., Buhalis D., Inversini A., Conceptualising smart tourism destination dimensions, Information and communication technologies in tourism 2015, pp. 391-403, (2015); Brandt T., Johannes J., Neumann D., Social media analytics and value creation in urban smart tourism ecosystems, Information & Management, 54, 6, pp. 703-713, (2017); Buhalis D., Law R., Progress in tourism management: Twenty years on and 10 years after the internet: The state of eTourism research, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 609-663, (2008); Buhalis D., Amaranggana A., Smart tourism destinations, Information and communication technologies in tourism, pp. 553-564, (2014); Buhalis D., Amaranggana A., Tussyadiah I., Inversini A., Smart tourism destinations enhancing tourism experience through personalisation of services, ENTER 2015 proceedings, (2015); Buhalis D., Foerste M., SoCoMo marketing for travel and tourism: Empowering co-creation of value, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 4, 3, pp. 151-161, (2015); Brown B., Chui M., Manyika J., Are you ready for the era of ‘Big Data’?, (2011); Canhoto A.I., Clark M., Customer service 140 characters at a time: The users’ perspective, Journal of Marketing Management, 29, 5-6, pp. 522-544, (2013); Caragliu A., Del Bo C., Nijkamp P., Smart Cities in Europe, (2009); Chen H., Chiang R.H., Storey V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: From Big Data to big impact, MIS Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012); Choudhury M.M., Harrigan P., CRM to social CRM: The integration of new technologies into customer relationship management, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 22, 2, pp. 149-176, (2014); Correia A., Kozak M., Ferradeira J., From tourist motivations to tourist satisfaction, International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 7, 4, pp. 411-424, (2013); Davenport T.H., Big Data at work: dispelling the myths, uncovering the opportunities, (2014); Davenport T.H., Barth P., Bean R., How Big Data is different, MIT Sloan Management Review, 54, 1, (2012); Day S.G., Closing the marketing capabilities gap, Journal of Marketing, 75, 4, pp. 183-195, (2011); Dumay J., A critical reflection on the future of intellectual capital: From reporting to disclosure, Journal of Intellectual capital, 17, 1, pp. 168-184, (2016); Del Vecchio P., Secundo G., Passiante G., Modularity as suitable approach for the management of a tourism destination, Proceedings of the 26th IBIMA conference “innovation management and sustainable economic competitive advantage: from regional development to global growth” Madrid, (2015); Del Vecchio P., Passiante G., Is tourism a driver for smart specialization?

Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers a conceptual overview of potential opportunities and changes to the study of consumer behavior that Big Data will likely bring. Findings – Big Data have the potential to further our understanding of each stage in the consumer decision-making process. While the field has traditionally moved forward using a priori theory followed by experimentation, it now seems that the nature of the feedback loop between theory and results may shift under the weight of Big Data. Research limitations/implications – A new data culture is now represented in marketing practice. The new group advocates inductive data mining and A/B testing rather than human intuition harnessed for deduction. The group brings with it interest in numerous secondary data sources. However, Big Data may be limited by poor quality, unrepresentativeness and volatility, among other problems. Practical implications – Managers who need to understand consumer behavior will need a workforce with different skill sets than in the past, such as Big Data consumer analytics. Originality/value – To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first articles to assess how the study of consumer behavior can evolve in the context of the Big Data revolution. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Big Data;

The phenomenon of capturing and trying to use all of the semi-structured and unstructured data has been called by vendors and bloggers ‘Big Data’. Organisations can capture and store data of many types from almost any source, but capturing and storing data only adds value when it has a useful purpose. Big Data must be used to provide input to analytics and decision support capabilities if it is to create real value for organisations. Some bloggers, industry leaders and academics have become disillusioned by the term Big Data. It is a marketing term and not a technical term. More descriptive terms like unstructured data, process data and machine data are more useful for information technology (IT) professionals. Researchers need to study and document use cases that explain how specific, novel data, so-called Big Data, can be used to support decision-making. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Analytics; Big Data; decision support; machine data","Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision support systems; Analytics; Decision supports; Information technology professionals; Large amounts; Machine data; Semi-structured; Technical terms; Unstructured data; Big data","","","","","","","Aziza B., Big data ‘A-Ha’ moment?, Forbes, (2013); Brust A., Big data: Defining its definition, ZDNet, (2012); Carter P., Big data analytics: Future architectures, skills and roadmaps for the CIO, IDC Whitepaper, (2011); Cooper M., Mell P., Tackling big data, Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum, (2012); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, pp. 70-76, (2012); Davenport T.H., Barth P., Bean R., How ‘big data’ is different, MIT Sloan Management Review, 54, pp. 22-24, (2012); De Goes J., ‘Big data’ is dead.

This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers’ opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers’ preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers’ opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product. This work constitutes a methodological contribution with demonstrated implications for new product positioning strategy evaluation using tweet analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Micro-blogs; Product positioning; Sentiment Analysis; Topic modelling","Behavioral research; Data Analytics; Decision making; Marketing; Android applications; Design-science researches; Electronic word of mouths; Electronic word of mouths (eWOM); Large amounts of data; Methodological contributions; Product positioning; Strategy evaluations; Product design","","","","","","","Abellan J., Castellano J.G., Improving the Naive Bayes classifier via a quick variable selection method using maximum of entropy, Entropy, 19, 6, (2017); Aggarwal P., Vaidyanathan R., Venkatesh A., Using Lexical Semantic Analysis to Derive Online Brand Positions: An Application to Retail Marketing Research, J.

The purpose of this paper is to examine if BD’s predictive power helps business to business (B2B) firms selecting their intended generic (differentiation, focus, and cost leadership) strategies. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the learning theory, the study proposes the use of BD as a key driver of intended strategies. Based on data from a cross-industry sample of executives, a conceptual model is tested using path and robustness analyses. Findings: The use of BD plays a prominent role in the selection of intended future strategies in industrial markets. Additional tests demonstrate conditions of competitive intensity and strategic flexibility where BD is more and less beneficial. Research limitations/implications: The study furthers the understanding of traditional learning and intelligence use frameworks and of contemporary future strategies drivers. Practical implications: BD availability enables managers leveraging knowledge embedded in data-rich systems to gain predictive insights that help in guiding new strategic directions to maintain competitive advantage. Originality/value: The study reinforces the continued applicability of Porter’s generic positioning strategies in the digital era. It addresses the paucity of research on BD in B2B context and is the first to provide theoretical and practical reflections on how BD utilization influences industrial intended strategies. The study strengthens contemporary managerial views defending that data drive strategies rather than the opposite. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Cost leadership strategy; Differentiation strategy;
