However, insurance companies need to have a good profile of potential policyholders. Customer profiling has become one of the essential marketing strategies for any sustainable business, such as the insurance market, to identify potential life insurance purchasers. One well-known method of carrying out customer profiling and segmenting is machine learning. Hence, this study aims to provide a helpful framework for predicting potential life insurance policyholders using a data mining approach with different sampling methods and to lead to a transition to sustainable life insurance industry development. Various samplings, such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, Randomly Under-Sampling, and ensemble (bagging and boosting) techniques, are proposed to handle the imbalanced dataset. The result reveals that the decision tree is the best performer according to ROC and, according to balanced accuracy, F1 score, and GM comparison, Naïve Bayes seems to be the best performer. It is also found that ensemble models do not guarantee high performance in this imbalanced dataset. However, the ensembled and sampling method plays a significant role in overcoming the imbalanced problem. © 2023 by the authors.","ensemble; imbalanced data; life insurance; machine learning; sampling","data mining; insurance industry; machine learning; prediction; sampling; sustainability","","","","","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM, (GGPM-2020-016)","This research was funded by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, grant number GGPM-2020-016.","Hiwase V.A., Agrawal A.J., Review on application of data mining in life insurance, Int.

A major challenge in this issue is considering the possibility of changes in the behavior of customers with the turn of time in the model. In this study, a new approach has been used to estimate the parameters of the model proposed for calculating the future lifetime value of Iran Khodro Spare Parts and After-Sale Services Co. (ISACO) customers. This method takes into consideration the possibility of changes in customer behavior throughout their interaction with the company. In this article, the customers of ISACO are first classified using clustering techniques and use multilayer neural network to calculate the monetary value of each group of customers during a specific period of time. Then, the Markov chain approach is used to develop a model for calculating the lifetime value of ISACO's customers considering the possibility of changes in their behavior in different periods. The results obtained here can be used in the allocation of marketing budget and adoption of macro-management decisions to envisage various projects for customers with different lifetime values. © 2019 Iran University of Science and Technology.","Clustering;

Toosi University of Technology, Iran","In today’s fast moving world of marketing from product-orientation to customer-orientation, the management of customer treatment can be seen as a key to achieve revenue growth and profitability. Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance. Most customer segmentation approaches based on customer value fail to account for the factor of time and the trend of value changes in their analysis. In this article, we classify customers based on their value using the RFM model and K-means clustering method. Then, an assessment of changes over several periods of time is carried out. The originality of this research lies in its incorporation of time and trend of customer value changes in improving the accuracy of predictions based on the past behavior of customers. For this purpose, we used the POS customer transactions. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Customer lifetime value; RFM model; Segmentation; Temporal data mining","","","","","","","","Bauer C.L., A direct mail customer purchase model, Journal of Direct Marketing, 2, 3, pp. 16-24, (1988); Berson A., Smith S., Thearling K., Building Data Mining Applications for CRM, (1999); Bose I., Chen X., Quantitative models for direct marketing: A review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Bottcher M., Hoppner F., Spiliopoulou M., On exploiting the power of time in data mining, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 10, 2, pp. 3-11, (2008); Bottcher M., Spott M., Nauck D., Kruse R., Mining changing customer segments in dynamic markets, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 1, pp. 155-164, (2009); Bramer M., Principles of Data Mining, 131, (2007); Chang H.-C., Tsai H.-P., Group RFM analysis as a novel framework to discover better customer consumption behavior, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 12, pp. 14499-14513, (2011); Chang H.H., Tsay S.F., Integrating of SOM and K-Mean in data mining clustering: An empirical study of CRM and profitability evaluation, Journal of Information Management, 11, 4, pp. 161-203, (2004); Chen M.-C., Chiu A.-L., Chang H.-H., Mining changes in customer behavior in retail marketing, Expert Systems with Applications, 28, 4, pp. 773-781, (2005); Cheng C.-H., Chen Y.-S., Classifying the segmentation of customer value via RFM model and RS theory, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3, pp. 4176-4184, (2009); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Morison R., Analytics at Work: Smarter Decisions, Better Results, (2010); Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques: Concepts and Techniques, (2011); Hosseini S.M.S., Maleki A., Gholamian M.R., Cluster analysis using data mining approach to develop CRM methodology to assess the customer loyalty, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 5259-5264, (2010); Hu Y.-H., Huang T.C., Kao Y.-H., Knowledge discovery of weighted RFM sequential patterns from customer sequence databases, Journal of Systems and Software, 86, 3, pp. 779-788, (2013); Huang T.C., Mining the change of customer behavior in fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns, Applied Soft Computing, 12, 3, pp. 1068-1086, (2012); Hughes A., Strategic Database Marketing, (1994); Hwang H., Jung T., Suh E., An LTV model and customer segmentation based on customer value: A case study on the wireless telecommunication industry, Expert Systems with Applications, 26, 2, pp. 181-188, (2004); Kim S.-Y., Jung T.-S., Suh E.-H., Hwang H.-S., Customer segmentation and strategy development based on customer lifetime value: A case study, Expert Systems with Applications, 31, 1, pp. 101-107, (2006); Kotler P., Marketing Management, (2001); Yen D.C., Customer relationship management: An analysis framework and implementation strategies, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 41, 3, pp. 82-97, (2001); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Integrating AHP and data mining for product recommendation based on customer lifetime value, Information & Management, 42, 3, pp. 387-400, (2005); Marcus C., A practical yet meaningful approach to customer segmentation, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 15, 5, pp. 494-504, (1998); Roddick J.F., Spiliopoulou M., A survey of temporal knowledge discovery paradigms and methods, Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions On, 14, 4, pp. 750-767, (2002); Song H.S., Kim S.H., Mining the change of customer behavior in an internet shopping mall, Expert Systems with Applications, 21, 3, pp. 157-168, (2001); Stone B., Successful Direct Marketing Methods, NTC Business Books, pp. 37-57, (1995); Tsai C.-Y., Chiu C.-C., A purchase-based market segmentation methodology, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, 2, pp. 265-276, (2004); Turban E., Sharda R., Aronson J.E., King D.N., Business Intelligence: a Managerial Approach, (2008); Verhoef P.C., Spring P.N., Hoekstra J.C., Leeflang P.S.H., The commercial use of segmentation and predictive modeling techniques for database marketing in the Netherlands, Decision Support Systems, 34, 4, pp. 471-481, (2003); Wei J.-T., Lin S.-Y., Wu H.-H., A review of the application of RFM model, African Journal of Business Management, 4, 19, pp. 4199-4206, (2010)","M.

The size of these data is impossible for traditional database and human analyst to come up with interesting information that will help in process of decision making. Management Information System (MIS) based Data warehouse (DW) and Data Mining (DM) techniques support the development of IT and process of management decision-making. But the traditional DW size make the query complex, which may cause unacceptable delay in decision support queries. Thus, in this paper an Efficient Electronic Bank MIS based DW and Mining Processing (EEBMIS-DWMP) was developed with cluster and non-cluster indexed view to provide decision-makers with both best response time and precise information. Also, analysis of the multilayer perception neural network, naïve Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and C5.0 on a real-world data of bank was done to improve effectiveness for campaign by analyzing the most useful features that influence campaign success. Results offer how the proposed EEBMIS-DWMP developed bank organizations by comparing performance of system with and without index view in terms of balance accuracy, accuracy, precision, recall, mean absolute error, root mean square error, F measure and running time. Conclusions from results offers that EEBMIS-DWMP can construct a database for each customer, a storage system that integrates data from a variety of sources into a single unified framework, decrease errors and time required to prepare financial reports, quickly access for information, analysis of data in multivariate, accurate prediction of competent, profitability segmentation. © 2022","Data mining; Data warehouse; Index view; Management information system; Marketing","Data handling; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Errors; Information management; Information use; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Query processing; Support vector machines; Bank managements; Data-mining techniques; Decision support query; Decisions makings; Design and implementations; In-process; Index view; Interesting information; Management decision-making; Mining processing; Data mining","","","","","Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Saudi Arabia; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation of China [Project in 2022：A Research on Synergetic Regulation and Supervision of ""Gray Rhino"" financial risks].

The method comprises of two main components: spatial co-location pattern mining and locationGCN, where locationGCN is based on graph convolutional network (GCN). The spatial co-location pattern mining is utilized to capture the spatial correlation of specific restaurant to determine the candidate location selection range. The locationGCN is designed to further screen out final suitable location ranges for the specific restaurant type. A case study using restaurant data from Xiamen Island collected from Dianping.com is conducted. The empirical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 74.88%, precision of 63.59%, and recall of 77.48%.

In recent years, many researches have tried to model the consumers’ decision-making process from different perspectives, like considering consumers' behavior patterns, integrating consumption theories, and utilizing different methods or tools. Most of these researches build models based on the Expected Utility Theory which depends on the ""Rational People"" hypothesis. However, online consumers often make some ""bounded rational"" or ""irrational"" decisions in an electronic commerce environment, due to peers’ influence. Therefore, Prospect Theory, which is dependent on the ""Irrational People"" hypothesis, is selected as the theoretical basis in this paper. We replace the traditional expected utility function with Prospect Theory’s value function to build a reasonable behavioral decision-making model. Moreover, an improvement in value function is acquired by the introduction of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number. We provide our approach in detail as follows. First, we construct the behavioral decision-making model based on Prospect Theory. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy number is introduced to express fuzzy decision-making information, which brings about improved value function, improved weight function as well as improved prospect function. We also build a more appropriate behavioral decision-making model. Therefore, we have determined the basic form of the model. Secondly, the whole service process of B2C electronic commerce is divided into six sub-processes by using service blueprinting. Based on these six sub-processes, the multiple attribute decision-making problem is defined through the determination of the multiple attribute structure and the set of alternatives which includes three dominant B2C platforms in China, e.g. Jingdong (jd.com), Yihaodian (yhd.com) and Dangdang (dangdang.com). Hence, the behavioral decision-making model of online consumers based on Prospect Theory has been determined. Thirdly, the behavioral model of decision-making is quantified by means of text mining of the collected eWOMs (Electronic Word-of-Mouth). The details of the process are showed as follows. First, we construct a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for eWOMs, which classifies eWOMs into different service sub-processes. Then the eWOMs in different sub-processes are clustered by the use of Weka, which is a data mining kit. Based on the clustering results, we can define 13 evaluating indicators and their corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the eWOMs into intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers, which determine the parameters of our model according to the results of sentiment analysis. Therefore, the model is quantified. Finally, we take Jingdong, Yihaodian and Dangdang as examples to test the behavioral model of decision-making. Furthermore, the reliability of this behavioral decision-making model is identified by comparison with the model based on the Expected Utility Theory. The results show that: (1) Compared with the models which are based on Expected Utility Theory, the behavioral decision model proposed in this paper performs better to reveal the practical situation. (2) Results of the calculated examples show that Jingdong scores the highest prospect values, followed by Yihaodian and Dangdang. Clustering of eWOMs results in 13 indicators. Jingdong scores the highest prospect values in seven indicators, while Yihaodian scores the highest ones in four indicators. Though Jingdong takes the highest overall score, its score is the lowest one in after-sales stage, giving rise to a narrowed gap in total score. While Yihaodian’s excellent service recovery help itself to rank second. The results show that proper service recovery strategies contribute to the improvement of service quality © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.","B2C e-commerce; Behavioral decision-making model; Electronic word-of-mouth; Intuitionistic fuzzy number; Prospect Theory","","","","","","","","(2016); 16, pp. 1-9, (2013); Nicosia F M., Consumer decision process: Marketing and advertising implication, (1966); Howard J A, Sheth J N., The theory of buyer behavior [M], (1969); Haubl G, Trifts V., Consumer decision making in online shopping environments: The effects of interactive decision aids [J], Marketing Science, 19, pp. 4-21, (2000); Jarvenpaa S L, Tractinsky N, Saarinen L, Et al., Consumer trust in an internet store: Across-cultural validation, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 5, 2, pp. 1-5, (1999); Talluri K T, Van Ryzin G., The theory and practice of revenue management, (2004); Simon H A., Theories of bounded rationality[J], Decision and Organization, 1, pp. 161-176, (1972); Tversky A, Kahneman D., Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases, Science, 185, 4157, pp. 1124-1131, (1974); 16, 2, (2013); Chevalier J A, Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); 9, 3, pp. 428-437, (2012); 5, pp. 65-75, (2012); Berger J., Word of mouth and interpersonal communication: A review and directions for future research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 586-607, (2014); 17, (2014); Tversky A, Kahneman D., Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 5, 4, pp. 297-323, (1992); 3, (2012); Zuo W M, Huang Q P, Fan C, Zhang Z P., Quality management of B2C E-commerce service based on human factors engineering[J], Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 12, 5, pp. 309-320, (2013); 17, (2006); Chang C C, Lin C J., LIBSVM: a library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, 3, (2011); (2008); Zadeh L.A., Fuzzy sets [J], Information and Control, 8, pp. 338-356, (1965); Chen S J, Hwang C L., Fuzzy multiple attribute decision making: methods and applications [M], (1992); Kahneman D, Tversky A., Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk, Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 47, 2, pp. 263-291, (1979); 7, 5, pp. 11-14, (2005); (2015); McCollough MA, Bharadwaj SG., The recovery paradox: An examination of consumer satisfaction in relation to disconfirmation, service quality, and attribution based theories[J], Marketing Theory and Applications, 3, (1992); 3, pp. 105-113, (2014); 31, 5, pp. 74-80, (2012)","","","Zhejiang University","","","","","","10046062","","","","English","J.

A structured questionnaire is used for the study. A total of 300 mines are randomly selected from a research population of mining organizations in South Africa, Africa and globally. The respondents are all part of senior management. A response rate of 64% is achieved. The results indicat that more than half of the respondents do not have real-time intelligence and proper data mining tools to identify patterns and relationships within a data warehouse. Although a large proportion agrees that their organizations have systematic ways of gathering these different types of intelligence and use them for strategic decision making, there is a significant proportion that did not have any systems. Statistically and practically significant positive relationships with a large effect are found among the dimensions of business intelligence, marketing intelligence, competitive intelligence and perceived business performance. © Dinko Herman Boikanyo, Ronnie Lotriet, Pieter W.

A segmentation index system of ETC customers comprising Recency, Frequency, and Monetary is extracted and constructed using ETC data. The whole-sample clustering analysis of ETC customers is accomplished with the Clustering LARge Applications (CLARA) algorithm while overcoming the invalidation problem of big data clustering. A decision tree on ETC customer segmentation is constructed and transformed into a set of segmentation rules. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is better able to analyze travel characteristics and to present values and appreciation potentials for ETC customer classification. This method provides an innovative idea for implementing precision marketing and establishing hierarchical discount rates for ETC customers. Furthermore, it provides theoretical support to increase the ETC customer scale and payment ratio, thus improving the decision-making level in expressway operation and management. © 2018 Chao Qian et al.","","Cluster analysis;

Traveler preference is unpredictable for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers. Data are derived from 118,000 records of online reviews. The methods and findings can help hotel managers gain insights into travelers' interests, enabling the former to gain a better understanding of the rapid changes in tourist preferences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Data mining; Emerging pattern mining; Hotel preference; Natural language processing; Travel behavior","data mining; demand analysis; Internet; performance assessment; service sector; strategic approach; corporate strategy; industrial performance; marketing; preference behavior; product development; travel behavior","","","","","Chinese Department of Education; Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Guangzhou Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71361007); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1:  Xinyuan (Roy) Zhao , Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in Hospitality Management at Business School, Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSBS).

One of their biggest concerns is to recognize the impact of actions taken on sold-out products. Data mining discovers and extracts useful patterns from such large data sets to find hidden and worthy patterns for the decision-making. This paper, too, aims to demonstrate the ability of data-mining process in improving the decision-making quality in the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach: This research is descriptive in terms of the method applied, as well as the investigation of the existing situation and the use of real data and their description. In fact, the study is quantitative and descriptive, from the point of view of its data type and method. This research is also applicable in terms of purpose. The target population of this research is the data of a pharmaceutical company in Iran. Here, the cross-industry standard process for data mining methodology was used for data mining and data modeling. Findings: With the help of different data-mining techniques, the authors could examine the effect of the visit of doctors overlooking the pharmacies and the target was set for medical representatives on the pharmaceutical sales. For that matter, the authors used two types of classification rules: decision tree and neural network. After the modeling of algorithms, it was determined that the two aforementioned rules can perform the classification with high precision. The results of the tree ID3 were analyzed to identify the variables and path of this relationship. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to provide the real-world direct empirical evidence of “Analytics of Physicians Prescription and Pharmacies Sales Correlation Using Data Mining.” The results showed that the most influential variables of “the relationship between doctors and their visits to pharmacies,” “the length of customer relationship” and “the relationship between the sale of pharmacies and the target set for medical representatives” were “deviation from the implementation plan.” Therefore, marketing and sales managers must pay special attention to these factors while planning and targeting for representatives. The authors could focus only on a small part of this study. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Data mining; Decision tree; Pharmaceutical industry; RFM model","","","","","","","","Al-Hamdi A.Y., Ibrahim M., Hassali M., The role of healthcare professionals in establishing unhealthy pharmaceutical promotion activities in Yemen, Journal of Medical Marketing: Device, Diagnostic and Pharmaceutical Marketing, 13, 3, pp. 142-150, (2013);

Indian agriculture faces several problems. Some of the problems are natural and some of them are manmade. Various problems faced in agriculture are Manures, Fertilizers, Pesticides, soil erosion, agricultural marketing, lack of mechanization and Irrigation. Among these problems, pests, germs and weeds cause heavy loss to crops. Excessive use of pesticides damages crops and results in heavy loss of yield. To optimize its use and help the farmers to know the proper use of pesticides, we propose a solution using data mining techniques. Technology plays a vital role in agriculture industry. It helps the farmers in reducing cost of production and increasing the quality and quantity of production. There are several parameters which are being monitored using wireless sensor networks in agriculture. Among these parameters, our main focus is pest control using Wireless Sensor Networks. This paper proposes a solution to the pest control using data mining and wireless sensor networks. © BEIESP.","Agriculture; Data Mining; Decision tree; Pest control; Wireless Sensor Networks","","","","","","","","Joshi P.P., Ss K., Joshi S.P.; Geetha M.C.S.; Azfar S., Nadeem A., Abdul Pest Detection and Control Techniques Using Wireless Sensor Network: A Review; Jawad H.M., Nordin R., Gharghan S.K., Ismail A.M.J.M., Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Agriculture: A Review; Zhua Y., Songa J., Fuzhou Donga a College of Communication and Electronics Jiangxi Science &Technology Normal University; Hussain R., Jha T., Saleh Y.; Yethiraj N.G., Department of Computer Science Maharani’s Science College for Women; Ayub U., Moqurrab S.A., Predicting crop diseases using data mining approaches: Classification, 2018 1St International Conference on Power, Energy and Smart Grid (ICPESG), pp. 1-6, (2018); Durgabai R.P.L., Bhargavi P., Jyothi S., MANAGEMENT USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS: A REVIEW; Revathy R.; Naik A.K., Dwivedi R.K.; Zhua Y., Songa J.; Utkarsha P., Narkhede K.P.; Solanki","","","Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication","","","","","","22773878","","","","English","Int.

The application of these models supports the identification of customers whose response can be traced back to be an effect of the campaign under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: First, a net scoring methodology based on decision trees is presented. Then, derived from research contributions on this subject and analytics performed on real data from the financial sector, different approaches of variable pre-selection are discussed and compared numerically. Findings: Net-χ2 and net information value as well as the rank lift impact correlation for interval variables would be preferred when performing variable pre-selection for net score models. Simulations showed that the results were relatively stable with respect to the number of cross-validation samples. Practical implications: Variable pre-selection is required since it reduces computational effort that comes along with the complexity of net score models and the availability of a large amount of potential predictors. Some pre-selection methods result in a set of predictors quite close to the application of net scores itself. Originality/value: Despite its lever on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, only few contributions address net scores up to now and yet fewer authors deal with variable pre-selection for those models. In this regard, this article is the first to develop and compare different approaches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer analytics; Data mining; Direct marketing","","","","","","","","Bose I., Chen X., Quantitative models for direct marketing: A review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Chao-hua L., Shu-qin C., Customer cross-selling model based on counter propagation network, Direct Marketing: An International Journal, 2, 1, pp. 36-47, (2008); Crone S.F., Lessmann S., Stahlbock R., The impact of preprocessing on data mining - an evaluation of classifier sensitivity in direct marketing, European Journal of Operational Research, 173, 3, pp. 781-800, (2006); Gersten W., Zielgruppenselektion für Direktmarketingkampagnen, (2005); Hansotia B., Rukstales B., Incremental value modeling, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 16, 3, pp. 35-46, (2002); Hsieh N.-C., An integrated data mining and behavioral scoring model for analyzing bank customers, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, 4, pp. 623-633, (2004); Larsen K., Net models, (2009); Larsen K., Net lift models, (2010); Lo V.S.Y., The true lift model - a novel data mining approach to response modeling in database marketing, SIGKDD Explorations, 4, 2, pp. 78-86, (2002); Ngai E.W.T., Xiu L., Chau D.C.K., Application of data mining techniques in customer relationship management - a literature review and classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2, pp. 2592-2602, (2009); Prinzie A., van den Poel D., Constrained optimization of data-mining problems to improve model performance - a direct-marketing application, Expert Systems with Applications, 29, 2, pp. 630-640, (2005); Radcliffe N.J., Simpson R., Identifying who can be saved and who will be driven away by retention activity, Journal of Telecommunications Management, 1, 2, pp. 168-176, (2008); Radcliffe N.J., Surry P.D., Real-World Uplift Modeling with Significance-Based Uplift Trees, (2011); Rzepakowski P., Jaroszewicz S., Decision trees for uplift modeling with single and multiple treatments, Knowledge and Information Systems, 28, 2, pp. 303-327, (2011); Weiss C., Datenanalyse Und Modellierung Mit STATISTICA, (2007); Chan C.C.H., Intelligent value-based customer segmentation method for campaign management - a case study of automobile retailer, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 1, pp. 2754-2762, (2008); Rygielsky C., Wang J.-C., Yen D.C., Data mining techniques for customer relationship management, Technology in Society, 24, 4, pp. 483-502, (2002); Shin H.J., Cho S., Response modeling with support vector machines, Expert Systems with Applications, 30, 4, pp. 746-760, (2006)","T. von Martens; Altran GmbH and Co.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the attributes usually referred to the characteristics of wheat flour known to consumers and at implementing a predictive model of purchasing that allows to make correct decisions without the necessary experience of a real human expert. Design/methodology/approach: In order to investigate the research aims of the paper, an online survey was carried out and conducted by means of the Google Forms in the detection time January-April 2016. The online survey collected responses from 467 Italian respondents asked to give feedback about their buying habits of various types of flour. The responses were analyzed through a data mining approach. This paper implements predictive analytics to create a statistical model of future behavior by means of a machine learning algorithms. Findings: In line with recent healthy and dynamic trends in the food industry, conscious consumer seems to be willing to pay a price for “type 1” wheat flour that is four times higher than the price related to the basic types of wheat flour. Social implications: Consumer seems not to know well the “type 1” wheat flour and its healthy characteristics; then, it should be crucial to implement promotional strategies and marketing hand in hand. Promotion can be a key element in putting across the health benefits of special kinds of wheat flour.

Extracting useful information from the huge volumes of data is always difficult due to the dynamic nature of data being stored. Data Mining is a knowledge discovery process used to extract the hidden information from the data stored in various repositories, termed as warehouses in the form of patterns. One of the popular tasks of data mining is Classification, which deals with the process of distinguishing every instance of a data set into one of the predefined class labels. Banking system is one of the real-world domains, which collects huge number of client data on a daily basis. In this work, we have collected two variants of the bank marketing data set pertaining to a Portuguese financial institution consisting of 41188 and 45211 instances and performed classification on them using two data reduction techniques. Attribute subset selection has been performed on the first data set and the training data with the selected features are used in classification. Principal Component Analysis has been performed on the second data set and the training data with the extracted features are used in classification. A deep neural network classification algorithm based on Backpropagation has been developed to perform classification on both the data sets. Finally, comparisons are made on the performance of each deep neural network classifier with the four standard classifiers, namely Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, Support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. It has been found that the deep neural network classifier outperforms the existing classifiers in terms of accuracy. © BEIESP.","Attribute Subset Selection; Classification; Data Mining; Deep Neural Networks; Principal Component Analysis","","","","","","","","Krishna C.L., Reddy P.V.S., An Efficient Deep Neural Network Classifier in Banking System, International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews, 6, 2, pp. 511-517, (2019); Han J., Kamber M., Data Mining Concepts and Techniques, (2006); Dunhamm M.H., Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics, (2006); Lin C., Yan F., The Study on Classification and Prediction for Data Mining, Seventh Int’l Conf. on Measuring Technology and Mechatronics Automation, (2015); Alasadi A.S., Bhaya W.S., Review of Data Preprocessing Techniques in Data Mining, Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 12, 6, pp. 4102-4107, (2017); Frempong A.J., Jayabalan M., Predicting Customer Response to Bank Direct Telemarketing Campaign”, 2017 International Conference on Engineering Technology and Technopreneurship, IEEE, (2017); Mitik M., Korkmaz O., Karagoz P., Toroslu H.I., Yucel F., Data Mining based Product Marketing Technique for Banking Products”, 16<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, IEEE, (2016); Grzonka D., Suchacka G., Borowik B., Application of Selected Supervised Classification Methods To Bank Marketing Campaign, Information Systems in Management, 5, 1, pp. 36-48, (2016); Ruangthong P., Jaiyen S., Bank Direct Marketing Analysis of Asymmetric Information Based on Machine Learning,  International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2015); Elsalamony A.H., Bank Direct Marketing Analysis of Data Mining Techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 85, 7, (2014); Elsalamony A.H., Elsayad M.A., Bank Direct Marketing Based on Neural Network, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, 2, 6, (2013); Koc A.A., Yeniay O., A Comparative Study of Artificial Neural Networks and Logistic Regression For Classification of Marketing Campaign Results, Mathematical and Computational Applications, 18, 3, pp. 392-398, (2013); Wisaeng K., A Comparison of Different Classification Techniques for Bank Direct Marketing, International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering, 3, 4, (2013); Krishna C.L., Reddy P.V.S., Principal Component Analysis on Mixed Data For Deep Neural Network Classifier in Banking System, International Journal of Computer Sciences and Engineering, 7, 5, pp. 129-134, (2019); Gao T., Li X., Chai Y., Tang Y., Deep Learning with Stock Indicators and two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis for closing price prediction system, Seventh IEEE Int’l Conf.

Since the arrival of the Web 2.0, more and more textual documents containing information that express opinions or comments in different languages are available. Given the proven importance of such documents, the use of effective multilingual opinion mining systems has become of high importance to different fields. This paper presents the experiments carried out with the objective to develop a multilingual sentiment analysis system. We present initial evaluations of methods and resources performed in two international evaluation campaigns for English and for Spanish. After our participation in both competitions, additional experiments were carried out with the aim of improving the performance of both Spanish and English systems by using multilingual machine-translated data. Based on our evaluations, we show that the use of hybrid features and multilingual, machine-translated data (even from other languages) can help to better distinguish relevant features for sentiment classification and thus increase the precision of sentiment analysis systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to choosing a city as a tourism destination. The purpose of this paper is to answer which are the characteristics that play a key role in room occupancy. Design/methodology/approach: Diverse characteristics such as the city offer, demographics, natural amenities (e.g. number of beaches) and also politics (e.g. type of government) are combined into a decision tree model to unveil the relevance of each in determining room occupancy. The empirical experiments used data known in 2015 from 43 cities from Europe and the rest of the World to model room occupancy rate in 2016. Findings: While the seasonality effect plays the most significant role, other less studied features such as the type of political party prior to current government were found to have an impact in room occupancy.

Lead scoring is an effective and efficient way of measuring the quality of leads. In addition, as a critical Information Technology tool, a proper lead scoring model acts as an alleviator to weaken the conflicts between sales and marketing functions. Yet, little is known regarding lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. Lead scoring models are commonly categorized into two classes: traditional and predictive. While the former primarily relies on the experience and knowledge of salespeople and marketers, the latter utilizes data mining models and machine learning algorithms to support the scoring process. This study aims to review and analyze the existing literature on lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine lead scoring models. A total of 44 studies have met the criteria and were included for analysis. Fourteen metrics were identified to measure the impact of lead scoring models on sales performance. With the increased use of data mining and machine learning techniques in the fourth industrial revolution, predictive lead scoring models are expected to replace traditional lead scoring models as they positively impact sales performance. Despite the relative cost of implementing and maintaining predictive lead scoring models, it is still beneficial to supersede traditional lead scoring models, given the higher effectiveness and efficiency of predictive lead scoring models. This study reveals that classification is the most popular data mining model, while decision tree and logistic regression are the most applied algorithms among all the predictive lead scoring models. This study contributes by systematizing and recommending which machine learning method (i.e., supervised and/or unsupervised) shall be used to build predictive lead scoring models based on the integrity of different types of data sources. Additionally, this study offers both theoretical and practical research directions in the lead scoring field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Data mining model;

This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques. Both theoretical and practical implications are provided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","E-commerce; Priming theory; Session-based recommendation; Text mining","Commerce; Data mining; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Product design; Across time; Key elements; Learning models; Learning techniques; Multiple user; Priming theory; Product information; Session-based recommendation; Text-mining; User sessions; Taps","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST 108-2410-H-027-020, MOST 109-2218-E-002-016, MOST 109-2410-H-027 -009 -MY2)","The authors are very grateful to the anonymous referees and Editor for their helpful comments and valuable suggestions for improving the earlier version of the paper.

Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profit. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible. The prediction results of M-GFDT and the method itself are useful for helping advertisers to optimize their ad strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filter; Online ads","Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Trees (mathematics); Tunneling (excavation); Decision tree classifiers; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filters; High-accuracy; Marketing message; Online ads; Potential customers; Two-stage methods; Pulse shaping circuits","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, (2018A030313795); National Nature Science Foundation of China, (71731006); Scientific and Technological Projects of Tianhe District of Guangzhou, (2018CX007)","This research was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 71731006; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, Grant No. 2018A030313795; and Scientific and Technological Projects of Tianhe District of Guangzhou, Grant No. 2018CX007.

The dataset for this research was collected from the complete Twitter timelines of ten academic libraries. The total dataset comprised 23,707 tweets with 17,848 mentions, 7625 hashtags, and 5974 retweets. Academic libraries from the dataset have typically posted fewer than 50 tweets per month, though tweet volume grew rapidly in late-2013 through 2014. The results show variance between academic libraries in distribution of tweets over time. The most frequent word was ""open,"" which was used in a variety of contexts by the academic libraries. It was noted that the most frequent bi-gram (two-word sequence) in the aggregated tweets was ""special collections"". The most frequent tri-gram (three-word sequence) was ""save the date"". The most frequent word categories in the semantic analysis for most libraries were related to ""knowledge, insight, and information concerning personal and cultural relations"". The most common category of the tweets was ""Resources"" among all the selected academic libraries.

However, it raises serious privacy concerns since the learning process may reveal sensitive information in the profiles. It is highly desirable to provide high-quality advertisement recommendations while respecting an individual's privacy. To address the privacy issues, we propose a practical privacy-preserving system that predicts advertisement Click Through Rate (CTR) accurately without revealing any sensitive information of individuals. Our system combines both offline and online training to achieve the goal. In the offline training phase, we develop two differentially private algorithms built upon Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) algorithms, respectively, to transform features and train a privacy-preserving offline model. In the online training phase, we propose a privacy-preserving online learning algorithm to compensate for the decline of offline performance when online feature changes occur. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our system based on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can protect user privacy without compromising the accuracy of CTR prediction, with reasonable computation overhead. © 2021","Data perturbation; Differential privacy;

In total, 92,934 images were scraped and further labeled through the Tencent Multi-Label API, which identified six categories of image cues. Second, an exploratory Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) analysis was performed to assess the importance of attributes at different levels from 746 valid survey responses. Furthermore, we performed Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to categorize the consumers by their choice features in which we identified two groups: “visual-image-cues responsive” and “price-rating-cue responsive.” These categories advance the proposed online impression-management conceptual model and indicate that visual information is the most important attribute in decision making. Our study provides empirically based suggestions to enable practitioners to strengthen their m-commerce marketing strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Conjoint analysis; Deep learning object detection; Image recognition; Latent class analysis; Mobile restaurant reservation","","","","","","","","Aggarwal P., Jun S.Y., Huh J.H., Scarcity messages, J.

In most of the Asian countries, it is a challenging task to perform EDM due to the diverse characteristics of the educational data. In this study, we have performed students’ educational performance prediction, pattern analysis and proposed a generalized framework to perform rigorous educational analytics. To validate our proposed framework, we have also conducted extensive experiments on a real-world dataset that has been prepared by the transcript data of the students from the Marketing department of a renowned university in Bangladesh. We have applied six state-of-the-art classification algorithms on our dataset for the prediction task where the Random Forest model outperforms the other models with accuracy 94.1%.

Quantitatively creating personas is gaining importance for its greater representability, objectivity, and fast creative speed. However, quantitative personas built using traditional statistical methods may not reflect the marketing goals of decision-makers, and they mainly focus on categorizing existing users rather than predicting target customers. To address the research gap, this study proposes a guideline to create a predictive persona by using data-mining algorithms resulting in personas that can be validated. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and credibility of personas to effectively predict new customers for target marketing. We demonstrate a step-by-step guideline for creating the proposed predictive persona using real user data, validating its credibility, and comparing its predictive power against traditional quantitative personas. We thoroughly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative personas, traditional quantitative personas, and predictive personas while portraying suitable scenarios in which each type of persona is appropriate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Data-mining; Persona; Predictive persona; Qualitative persona; Quantitative persona; Target marketing","Commerce; Data mining; Decision making; Marketing; Creatives; Persona; Predictive persona; Qualitative persona; Quantitative persona; Representability; Target marketing; User goals; User need; Users' experiences; Big data","","","","","","","Alkurd R., Abualhaol I., Yanikomeroglu H., Big-data-driven and AI-based framework to enable personalization in wireless networks, IEEE Commun.

Binary or dichotomous data are widely spread across various fields of research - in decision making and data mining, marketing, solving of many natural, social and technical problems. The initial data for building the model is a set of states of an autonomous dynamical system with components taking binary values. At the same time, the time order of the states is permissible. The following objectives were stated: to identify the relationships between the components of the system defining its dynamics; on the basis of the identified dynamics, to recover the true order of the system states; to apply the developed model to the problem of visual identification of cyanobacteria in water areas using digital photography. To solve the problem, we used a mathematical model that enables to describe the relationships between components and transitions between the system states at a simple-forunderstanding level. The principle of parsimony underlies the model. According to this principle, the most appropriate model is described by the simplest relations in the sense defined in the work. As the case study, the problem of recognizing clumps of cyanobacteria from digital satellite imagery was considered. This is a complex, practically important problem that does not have a satisfactory experimental and theoretical solution at the moment. Applying system approaches to the measured colorimetric parameters of digital photography, we developed the index for identification of such clumps. This index uses the parameters of the digital RGB model of (various parts of) an image and allows us to reveal clumps of cyanobacteria on digital images obtained by aerospace methods. Additionally, digital photography can be performed in the conditions of insufficient visibility (due to precipitation, fog, and other factors), for imitation of which in the case study the original image was distorted by the digital noise. The studied model can find useful applications in the areas requiring binary dynamical data insights. © K. Nosov, G. Zholtkevych, M. Georgiyants, O. Vysotska, Y. Balym, A.

However, categories often involve self-categorization (e.g., marketer defined) that may not reflect the reality of dynamic markets and industries. In this study of the cruise industry, we derive a new categorization approach using consumer perceptions of their cruise experiences to challenge a long-standing industry typology. Results using a variety of statistical tests of J.D. Power data from more than 3,000 cruisers yield a new and more informative category structure and assignment of cruise lines to it. Analyses reveal differences between the new cruise categories in terms of determinants that influence customer choice. Discussion highlights benefits to travel practitioners of using dynamic and customer-based categories, as well as to researchers of applying advanced statistical techniques to expose unexpected and insightful patterns in secondary data. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","categorization; cruise industry; customer experience; data mining; marketing","Vindula arsinoe; data mining; decision making; perception; statistical analysis; travel behavior","","","","","","","Aguinis H., Gottfredson R.K., Joo H., Best-Practice Recommendations for Defining, Identifying, and Handling Outliers, Organizational Research Methods, 16, 2, pp. 270-301, (2013); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Applegate L.M., Kwortnik R.J., Piccoli G., Carnival Cruise Lines, Harvard Business School Case Series, (2005); Arnould E.J., Price L.L., River Magic: Extraordinary Experience and the Extended Service Encounter, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 1, pp. 24-45, (1993); Awaritefe O.D., Image Difference between Culture and Nature Destination Visitors in Tropical Africa: Case Study of Nigeria, Current Issues in Tourism, 8, 5, pp. 363-393, (2005); Barsalou L.W., Ideals, Central Tendency, and Frequency of Instantiation as Determinants of Graded Structure in Categories, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 11, 4, pp. 629-654, (1985); Baum J., Lant T., Hits and Misses: Managers’ (Mis)categorization of Competitors in the Manhattan Hotel Industry, Geography and Strategy.

The number of complaints against the mobile-phone-service providers is also high. Therefore, the mobile service providers are facing a huge challenge in retaining their customers. There are a number of existing models to analyse customer behaviour and switching patterns. A number of switching models may also exist within a large market. These models are often not useful due to the heterogeneous nature of the market. Therefore, in this study we use data mining techniques to let the data talk to help us discover switching patterns without requiring us to use any models and domain knowledge. We use a variety of decision tree and decision forest techniques on a real mobile-phone-usage dataset in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of data mining techniques in knowledge discovery. We report many interesting patterns, and discuss them from a brand-switching and marketing perspective, through which they are found to be very sensible and interesting © 2016 Islam, D’Alessandro, Furner, Johnson, Gray & Carter.

However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","customer knowledge management; data mining; fast-cycle industry; product development","Commerce; Competition; Decision trees; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Planning; Product development; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Apriori algorithms; Competitive advantage; Customer knowledge; Customer knowledge management; Data-driven methods; Innovative product development; Knowledge-based approach; Marketing strategy; Data mining","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71525005, 71821002)","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71525005, #71821002).

Manouba, ESEN, Tunisia","With the rise of social media platforms for marketing purposes, the central dilemma for researchers and policymakers lies in choosing effective data analysis tools to improve marketing decisions. In the academic literature, numerous articles have discussed clustering techniques for analysing social media data, from a perspective of data mining or social media marketing. However, few studies have attempted to synthesise results obtained from both perspectives. This research aims to (1) offer a structured overview of existing literature on clustering methods for marketing strategies and (2) compare three topic modelling techniques applied to extract the main topics evoked in the corpus of papers. Indeed, topic modelling emerges as a valuable tool for extracting relevant information from big data in general and more specifically from extensive scientific papers. Based on a thematic analysis, the extracted topics were classified according to the following categories: fields, marketing strategies and technologies. Results prove that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most effective technique in this context. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of clustering techniques and technologies used for marketing strategies in studied fields. These findings help researchers and practitioners to select the best techniques and technologies for extracting marketing knowledge from big data. © 2024 Telecommunications Association Inc..

The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To retain consumers, practitioners aim to predict which consumers intend to churn (ie leave), and to understand the reasons behind this intention. To address this need, this study uses data-mining techniques to develop a churn prediction model. The study aims to identify the information that is predictive of churn and, consequently, to shed light on the psychological reasons behind churn. The authors built eight predictive models using decision trees, random forest and logistic regression on a dataset composed of 81,813 consumers of an energy provider, each with one residential electricity contract. The logistic regression was found to outperform the other methods. The discussion focuses on the relevant predictors of churn by addressing a posteriori psychological explanations of consumers’ churn behaviour. The study provides new insights on the reasons why customers churn and, by addressing theoretical psychological explanations, provides a data-mining model with robustness to contextual changes. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Churn prediction model; Consumer psychology; Customer churn; Energy market; Machine learning","","","","","","","","Neslin S.A., Gupta S., Kamakura W., Lu J.X., Mason C.H., Defection detection: measuring and understanding the predictive accuracy of customer churn models, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 2, pp. 204-211, (2006); Thaichon P., Quach T.N., Integrated marketing communications and their effects on customer switching intention, Journal of Relationship Marketing, 15, 1–2, pp. 1-16, (2016); Chuang Y.F., Pull-and-suck effects in Taiwan mobile phone subscribers switching intentions, Telecommunication Policy, 35, 2, pp. 128-140, (2011); Ganesh J., Arnold M.J., Reynolds K.E., Understanding the customer base of service providers: an examination of the differences between switchers and stayers, Journal of Marketing, 64, 3, pp. 65-87, (2000); Verbeke W., Martens D., Mues C., Baesens B., Building comprehensible customer churn prediction models with advanced rule induction techniques, Expert System with Application, 38, 3, pp. 2354-2364, (2011); Kuo Y.F., Hu T.L., Yang S.C., Effects of inertia and satisfaction in female online shoppers on repeat-purchase intention:The moderating roles of word-of-mouth and alternative attraction, Managing Service Quality: An International Journal, 23, 3, pp. 168-187, (2013); Keaveney S.M., Parthasarathy M., Customer switching behavior in online services: an exploratory study of the role of selected attitudinal, behavioral, and demographic factors, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 29, 4, pp. 374-390, (2001); Dalvi P.K, Khandge S.K., Deomore A., Bankar A., Kanade V.A., Analysis of customer churn prediction in telecom industry using decision trees and logistic regression, the 2016 Symposium on Colossal Data Analysis and Networking (CDAN), (2016); Ahmed A.A.Q., Maheswari D., Churn prediction on huge telecom data using hybrid firefly based classification, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 18, 3, pp. 2-7, (2016); Mahajan V., Misra R., Mahajan R., Review of data-mining techniques for churn prediction in telecom, Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences, 39, 2, pp. 183-197, (2015); Holtrop N., Wieringa J.E., Gijsenberg M.J., Verhoef P.C., No future without the past?

This article examines the impacts of BI on customer relationship management (CRM) functions (marketing, sales and customer services) in the telecommunications sector. The literature found that BI application in CRM in a telecommunications context is limited but necessary due to the high rate of competition between service providers and the massive data generated by subscribers. This study surveyed employees' perspectives from telecommunications companies in Oman, and results demonstrated mixed impacts. First, the results showed that implementing BI in marketing has a positive impact on business processes values, customer values, but a negative impact on employees' values. Second, implementing BI in sales has a positive impact on financial values and employees' values, but a negative impact on business processes values, and customers' values. Finally, implementing BI in customer service has a positive impact on employees' values. The study provides valuable guidelines for practitioners in the area of CRM, BI, and telecommunications to help understand why to invest in BI in specific CRM functions. © 2018, IGI Global.

The social networks have accumulated a large amount of information, which can be used in different ways. One of such possible purposes is advertising. In particular, when a company pays for advertising in a social network, it wants to get an ideal deployment of the ads on the network. The ideal behavior aims at reducing the high costs to pay, the number of hours to design advertising, the difficulty in the creation of ads by lots, among other things. In particular, the optimization of the production of advertising on social networks, based on the performance of the ads, is not an easy task. If we make an incorrect design, this can result in losses for a company. In this sense, this paper presents an intelligent system of management of social network advertising, based on data mining techniques, to automatically produce ads. In addition, we test our adaptive mechanism of automated production (generation) of online advertising on Facebook. Our system carries out automatic modifications and improvements of ads. Facebook is one of the more popular social networks, being widely used by companies for advertising, in order to create contents attracting the attention of users. © 2014 IEEE.","Decision support systems; Facebook; intelligent systems; online advertising; social networks","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Industry; Information management; Intelligent systems; Marketing; Online systems; Production; Adaptive mechanism; Automated productions; Facebook; High costs; Ideal behavior; Intelligent management systems; Large amounts; Online advertising; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Aggarwal C., Social Network Data Analytics, (2011); Aguilar J., Teran O., Social media and free knowledge: Case study: Public opinion formation, Societal Benefits of Freely Accessible Technologies and Knowledge Resources, J, pp. 156-190, (2015); Aguilar J., A general ant colony model to solve combinatorial optimization problems, Revista Colombiana Comput., 2, pp. 7-18, (2001); Aguilar J., Miranda P., Approaches based on genetic algorithms for multiobjetive optimization problems, Proc.

However, though many firms want to take advantage of AI to improve marketing, they lack a process by which to execute a Marketing AI project. This article discusses the use of AI to provide support for marketing decisions. Based on the established Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, it creates a process for managers to use when executing a Marketing AI project and discusses issues that might arise.

Organizations also publish anonymous data to facilitate research in social science, healthcare, identification of fraudulent users, and trend analysis to foster sales and marketing techniques. Privacy Preserving Data Mining [PPDM] protects the disclosure of sensitive information present in the published datasets. Most of the existing pool of algorithms perturb the attributes forbidding verification of original data at receivers’ end. This paper introduces a Reversible Data Perturbation iHiMod-Perturb approach efficient in privacy preservation and enabling recovery of original data, if needed, at the receiver end. Unlike traditional methods that adds/multiply noise or randomly project data, our method uses differences of adjoining values as basis for modification to perturb sensitive attributes. Selection of privacy factor and embedding of digital watermark ensures data integrity along with perturbation. The privacy factor enables user specific adaptable privacy preservation model in contrast to one-level model. Experiments are performed on five datasets from UCI Repository and confirms that the Classification Accuracy of the perturbed dataset is preserved well. Experiments also suggest that the Probability Information Loss [PIL] is less than 25% and Disclosure Risk [DR] is less than 8% after application of iHiMod-Perturb algorithm. © IJSTR 2019.","Decision Tree; Histogram Modification; Naïve Bayes; Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Reversible Data Perturbation; Support Vector Machines","","","","","","","","Shah A., Gulati R., Evaluating Applicability Of Perturbation Techniques For Privacy Preserving Data Mining By Descriptive Statistics, Proceedings of 2016 Intl.

However, many classification algorithms in the literature assume that the target attribute values in the datasets are unordered, so they lose inherent order between the class values. To overcome the problem, this study proposes a novel ensemble-based ordinal classification (EBOC) approach which suggests bagging and boosting (AdaBoost algorithm) methods as a solution for ordinal classification problem in transportation sector. This article also compares the proposed EBOC approach with ordinal class classifier and traditional tree-based classification algorithms (i.e., C4.5 decision tree, RandomTree, and REPTree) in terms of accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed EBOC approach achieves better classification performance than the conventional solutions. © 2019 Pelin Yildirim et al.","","Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning systems; AdaBoost algorithm; Attribute values; C4.5 decision trees; Classification algorithm; Classification performance; Historical data; Ordinal classification; Transportation sector; Data mining","","","","","","","Lv Y., Duan Y., Kang W., Li Z., Wang F.-Y., Traffic flow prediction with big data: A deep learning approach, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 16, 2, pp. 865-873, (2015); Wen X., Shao L., Xue Y., Fang W., A rapid learning algorithm for vehicle classification, Information Sciences, 295, pp. 395-406, (2015); Ball S., Sagbas E.A., Diagnosis of transportation modes on mobile phone using logistic regression classification, IET Software, 12, 2, pp. 142-151, (2018); Nguyen H., Cai C., Chen F., Automatic classification of traffic incident's severity using machine learning approaches, IET Intelligent Transport Systems, 11, 10, pp. 615-623, (2017); Kedar-Dongarkar G., Das M., Driver classification for optimization of energy usage in a vehicle, Procedia Computer Science, 8, pp. 388-393, (2012); Deepika N., Sajith Variyar V.V., Obstacle classification and detection for vision based navigation for autonomous driving, Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI, 2017, pp. 2092-2097, (2017); Frank E., Hall M., A simple approach to ordinal classification, Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML) Volume 2167 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 145-156, (2001); Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2014); Destercke S., Yang G., Cautious ordinal classification by binary decomposition, Proceedings of the Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases-European Conference ECML/PKDD, pp. 323-337, (2014); Cardoso J.S., Pinto Da Costa J.F., Learning to classify ordinal data: The data replication method, Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 8, pp. 1393-1429, (2007); Li L., Lin H.T., Ordinal regression by extended binary classification, Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 865-872, (2006); Harrell F.E., Ordinal logistic regression, Regression Modeling Strategies, Springer Series in Statistics, pp. 311-325, (2015); Rennie J.D., Srebro N., Loss functions for preference levels: Regression with discrete ordered labels, Proceedings of the IJCAIMultidisciplinaryWorkshop Adv.

It is essential for managers to gain a confident understanding of their business environments in order to make successful decisions. With the growth of opinion-rich web resources such as social media, discussion forums, review sites, news corpora, and blogs available on the internet, product and service reviews have become an essential source of information. In a data-driven world, they will improve services and operational insights to achieve real business benefits and help enterprises remain competitive. Despite the prevalence of textual data, few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of real-time text mining and reporting tools in firms and organizations. To address this aspect of decision-making, we have developed and evaluated an unsupervised learning system to automatically extract and classify topics and their emotion score in text streams. Data were collected from commercial websites, open-access databases, and social networks to train the model. In the experiment, the polarity score was quantified at four different levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and the entire text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using subjective data mining, we demonstrate how to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of information from the Web and help traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to capture more information. An opinion tracking system presented by our model extracts subjective information, classifies them, and tracks opinions by utilizing location, time, and reviewers’ positions. Using the online-offline data collection technique, we can update the library topic in real-time to provide users with a market opinion tracker. For marketing or economic research, this approach may be useful. In the experiment, the new model is applied to a case study to demonstrate how the business process improves. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Alber M., Buganza Tepole A., Cannon W.R., De S., Dura-Bernal S., Garikipati K., Kuhl E., Integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling—perspectives, challenges, and opportunities in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences, NPJ Digit Med, 2, 1, pp. 1-11, (2019); Alves H., Koch A., Unkelbach C., Why good is more alike than bad: Processing implications, Trend Cogn Sci, 21, 2, pp. 69-79, (2017); Amado A., Cortez P., Rita P., Moro S., Research trends on Big Data in Marketing: a text mining and topic modeling based literature analysis, Eur Res Manage Bus Econ, 24, 1, pp. 1-7, (2018); Araque O., Zhu G., Iglesias C.A., A semantic similarity-based perspective of affect lexicons for sentiment analysis, Knowl Based Syst, 165, pp. 346-359, (2019); Bail C.A., The fringe effect: Civil society organizations and the evolution of media discourse about Islam since the September 11th attacks, Am Sociol Rev, 77, 6, pp. 855-879, (2012); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation, J Mach Learn Res, 3, Jan, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bollen J., Mao H., Pepe A., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 5, 1, pp. 450-453, (2011); Bravo-Marquez F., Mendoza M., Poblete B., Combining strengths, emotions and polarities for boosting Twitter sentiment analysis, Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Issues of Sentiment Discovery and Opinion Mining, pp. 1-9, (2013); Cambria E., Affective computing and sentiment analysis, IEEE Intell Syst, 31, 2, pp. 102-107, (2016); Carrera-Trejo J.V., Sidorov G., Miranda-Jimenez S., Moreno Ibarra M., Cadena, Martinez R., Latent Dirichlet Allocation complement in the vector space model for multi-label text classification, Int J Comb Optim Probl Inform, 6, 1, pp. 7-19, (2015); Costa M., Gomes D., Silva M.J., The evolution of web archiving, Int J Digit Libr, 18, 3, pp. 191-205, (2017); Cui A., Zhang M., Liu Y., Ma S., Emotion tokens: Bridging the gap among multilingual twitter sentiment analysis, Asia Information Retrieval Symposium, pp. 238-249, (2011); Da'u A., Salim N., Rabiu I., Osman A., Recommendation system exploiting aspect-based opinion mining with deep learning method, Inf Sci, 512, pp. 1279-1292, (2020); de Rijke M., Jijkoun V., Laan F., Weerkamp W., Ackermans P., Geleijnse G., Generating, refining and using sentiment lexicons, Essential Speech and Language Technology for Dutch, pp. 359-377, (2013); Dong R., O'Mahony M.P., Schaal M., McCarthy K., Smyth B., Combining similarity and sentiment in opinion mining for product recommendation, J Intell Inf Syst, 46, 2, pp. 285-312, (2016); Dridi A., Recupero D.R., Leveraging semantics for sentiment polarity detection in social media, Int J Mach Learn Cybernet, 10, 8, pp. 2045-2055, (2019); Farzaneh N., Williamson C.A., Gryak J., Najarian K., A hierarchical expert-guided machine learning framework for clinical decision support systems: an application to traumatic brain injury prognostication, NPJ Digit Med, 4, 1, pp. 1-9, (2021); Friesen G., Weller P.A., Quantifying cognitive biases in analyst earnings forecasts, J Financ Mark, 9, 4, pp. 333-365, (2006); Gajzler M., Text and data mining techniques in aspect of knowledge acquisition for decision support system in construction industry, Technol Econ Dev Econ, 2, pp. 219-232, (2010); Giordano V.E., Defining definition: A text mining approach to define innovative technological fields, (2021); Greco F., Polli A., Emotional text mining: customer profiling in brand management, Int J Inf Manag, 51, (2020); Grimmer J., Stewart B.M., Text as data: the promise and pitfalls of automatic content analysis methods for political texts, Polit Anal, 21, 3, pp. 267-297, (2013); Hasan M., Rundensteiner E., Agu E., Automatic emotion detection in text streams by analyzing twitter data, Int J Data Sci Analyt, 7, 1, pp. 35-51, (2019); Hertrich I., Dietrich S., Ackermann H., The margins of the language network in the brain, Front Commun, 5, (2020); Idalski Carcon A., Hasan M., Alexander G.L., Dong M., Eggly S., Brogan Hartlieb K., Kotov A., Developing machine learning models for behavioral coding, J Pediat Psychol, 44, 3, pp. 289-299, (2019); Ignatow G., Theoretical foundations for digital text analysis, J Theory Soc Behav, 46, 1, pp. 104-120, (2016); Indurkhya N., Damerau F.J., D Palmer D., Text Preprocessing.

However, when machine learning is used for decision-making, bias rooted in unrepresentative datasets, inadequate models, weak algorithm designs, or human stereotypes can lead to low performance and unfair decisions, resulting in financial, social, and reputational losses. This paper offers a systematic, interdisciplinary literature review of machine learning biases as well as methods to avoid and mitigate these biases. We identified eight distinct machine learning biases, summarized these biases in the cross-industry standard process for data mining to account for all phases of machine learning projects, and outline twenty-four mitigation methods. We further contextualize these biases in a real-world case study and illustrate adequate mitigation strategies. These insights synthesize the literature on machine learning biases in a concise manner and point to the importance of human judgment for machine learning algorithms. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Case study; Machine learning; Mitigation methods","","","","","","Academy of Marketing Science","Dennis Herhausen (Ph.D., University of St.Gallen) is Associate Professor of Marketing at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The main objective is to analyse the relation between multi attribute decision making and data mining considering a complex problem of ordering customers segments, which is based on four criteria of customer’s life time value, viz. length (L), recency (R), frequency (F) and monetary value (M). The proposed integrated approach involves fuzzy C-means (FCM) cluster analysis as data mining tool. The experiment conducted using MATLAB 12.0 for identifying eight clusters of customers. The two multi attribute decision making tools i.e., fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) are used for ranking these identified clusters. The applicability of the integrated decision making technique is also demonstrated in this paper considering the case of Indian retail sector. This research collected responses from nine experts from Indian retail industry regarding their perception of relative importance of four criteria of customer life value and evaluated weights of each criterion using fuzzy AHP. Transaction data of 18 months of the case retail store was analysed to segment 1,600 customers into eight clusters using fuzzy c-means clustering analysis technique. Finally, these eight clusters were ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The findings of this research could be helpful for firms in identifying the more valuable customers for them and allocate more resources to satisfy them. The findings will be also helpful in developing different loyalty program strategies for customers of different clusters. © 2021, Technical University of Liberec.

Data mining methods provides the insurance industry with numerous advantages: shorter data processing times, more sophisticated methods for more accurate data analysis, better decision-making, etc. Insurance companies use data mining methods for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to fraud prevention. The process of insurance premium pricing was one of the first applications of data mining methods in insurance industry. The application of the data mining method in this paper aims to improve the results in the process of non-life insurance premium ratemaking. The improvement is reflected in the choice of predictors or risk factors that have an impact on insurance premium rates. The following data mining methods for the selection of prediction variables were investigated: Forward Stepwise, Decision trees and Neural networks. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used for premium ratemaking, as the main statistical model for non-life insurance premium pricing today in most developed insurance markets in the world. © 2020, University of Rijeka.

It introduces a new method to forecast campaign-related uplifts (also known as incremental response modeling or net scoring). By means of these uplifts, only the most responsive customers are targeted by a campaign. This paper also aims at calculating the financial impact of the new approach compared to the classical (gross) scoring methods. Design/methodology/approach: First, gross and net scoring approaches to customer selection for direct marketing campaigns are compared. After that, it is shown how net scoring can be applied in practice with regard to different strategical objectives. Then, a new statistic for net scoring based on decision trees is developed. Finally, a business case based on real data from the financial sector is calculated to compare gross and net scoring approaches. Findings: Whereas gross scoring focuses on customers with a high probability of purchase, regardless of being targeted by a campaign, net scoring identifies those customers who are most responsive to campaigns. A common scoring procedure – decision trees – can be enhanced by the new statistic to forecast those campaign-related uplifts. The business case shows that the selected scoring method has a relevant impact on economical indicators. Practical implications: The contribution of net scoring to campaign effectiveness and efficiency is shown by the business case. Furthermore, this paper suggests a framework for customer selection, given strategical objectives, e.g. minimizing costs or maximizing (gross or lift)-added value, and presents a new statistic that can be applied to common scoring procedures. Originality/value: Despite its lever on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, only few contributions address net scores up to now. The new χ2-statistic is a straightforward approach to the enhancement of decision trees for net scoring. Furthermore, this paper is the first to the application of net scoring with regard to different strategical objectives. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer analytics; Data mining; Database marketing; Direct marketing","","","","","","","","Ahmad R., Buttle F., Customer retention management: a reflection of theory and practice, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 20, 3, pp. 149-161, (2002); Bose I., Chen X., Quantitative models for direct marketing: a review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Chan C.C.H., Intelligent value-based customer segmentation method for campaign management – a case study of automobile retailer, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 1, pp. 2754-2762, (2008); Crone S.F., Lessmann S., Stahlbock R., The impact of preprocessing on data mining – an evaluation of classifier sensitivity in direct marketing, European Journal of Operational Research, 173, 3, pp. 781-800, (2006); Falk M., Marohn F., Tewes B., Foundations of Statistical Analyses – Applications with SAS, (2002); Gersten W., Zielgruppenselektion für Direktmarketingkampagnen, (2005); Hansotia B., Rukstales B., Incremental value modeling, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 16, 3, pp. 35-46, (2002); Hsieh N.-C., An integrated data mining and behavioral scoring model for analyzing bank customers, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, 4, pp. 623-633, (2004); Imai K., Ratkovic M., Estimating treatment effect heterogeneity in randomized program evaluation, The Annals of Applied Statistics, 7, 1, pp. 443-470, (2013); Jaskowski M., Jaroszewicz S., Uplift modelling for clinical trial data, (2012); Lo V.S.Y., The true lift model – a novel data mining approach to response modeling in database marketing, SIGKDD Explorations, 4, 2, pp. 78-86, (2002); Michel R., Schnakenburg I., von Martens T., Methods of variable pre-selection for net score modelling, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 7, 4, pp. 257-268, (2013); Michel R., Schnakenburg I., von Martens T., -test for uplift models with applications in marketing performance measurement, (2014); Nassif H., Kuusisto F., Burnside E., Page D., Shavlik J., Santos Costa V., Score as you lift (SAYL): a statistical relational learning approach to uplift modeling, Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML), (2013); Ngai E.W.T., Xiu L., Chau D.C.K., Application of data mining techniques in customer relationship management – a literature review and classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2, pp. 2592-2602, (2009); Prinzie A., van den Poel D., Constrained optimization of data-mining problems to improve model performance – a direct-marketing application, Expert Systems with Applications, 29, 2, pp. 630-640, (2005); Radcliffe N.J., Simpson R., Identifying who can be saved and who will be driven away by retention activity, Journal of Telecommunications Management, 1, 2, pp. 168-176, (2008); Radcliffe N.J., Surry P.D., Real-world uplift modeling with significance-based uplift trees, (2011); Rygielsky C., Wang J.-C., Yen D.C., Data mining techniques for customer relationship management, Technology in Society, 24, 4, pp. 483-502, (2002); Rzepakowski P., Jaroszewicz S., Decision trees for uplift modeling with single and multiple treatments, Knowledge and Information Systems, 28, 2, pp. 303-327, (2011); Safari F., Safari N., Gholam A.M., Customer lifetime value determination based on RFM model, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 34, 4, (2016); Shin H.J., Cho S., Response modeling with support vector machines, Expert Systems with Applications, 30, 4, pp. 746-760, (2006); Straker K., Wrigley C., Rosemann M., Typologies and touchpoints: designing multi-channel digital strategies, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 9, 2, pp. 110-128, (2015); Tian L., Alizadeh A.A., Gentles A.J., Tibshirani R., A simple method for detecting interactions between a treatment and a large number of covariates, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 109, 508, pp. 1517-1532, (2014); Weiss C., Datenanalyse und Modellierung mit STATISTICA, (2007); Zorn S., Jarvis W., Bellman S., Attitudinal perspectives for predicting churn, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 4, 2, pp. 157-169, (2010); Bohm U., Uplift Modelling mit SAS – Hintergründe und Tipps, (2012); Cummins S., Peltier J.W., Schibrowsky J.A., Nill A., Consumer behavior in the online context, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 8, 3, pp. 169-202, (2014)","R.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a multiple methods approach to elicit intelligence and value from big data by analysing the customer behaviour in mobile app usage. Design/methodology/approach - The big data analytical approach is developed using three data mining techniques: RFM(recency, frequency, monetary) analysis, link analysis, and association rule learning. The authors then conduct a case study to apply this approach to analyse the transaction data extracted from a mobile app. Findings - This approach can identify high value and mass customers, and understand their patterns and preferences in using the functions of the mobile app. Such knowledge enables the developer to capture the behaviour of large pools of customers and to improve products and services by mixing and matching the functions and offering personalised promotions and marketing information. Originality/value - The approach used in this study balances complexity with usability, thus facilitating corporate use of big data in making product improvement and customisation decisions. The approach allows developers to gain insights into customer behaviour and function usage preferences by analysing big data. The identified associations between functions can also help developers improve existing, and design new, products and services to satisfy customers' unfulfilled requirements. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data;

The predictive modeling in these courses requires students to estimate and test many linear regressions. As a result, false positive variable selection (type I errors) is nearly certain to occur. This article describes an in-class demonstration that shows the frequency and impact of false positives on data mining regression-based predictive modeling. In this demonstration, 500 randomly generated independent (X) variables are individually regressed against a single, randomly generated (Y) variable, and the resulting 500 p-values are sorted and examined. This experiment is repeated and the distribution of the number of variables significant at the 5% level resulting from this simulation is presented and discussed. The demonstration provides a tangible example in which students see the reality and risks of incorrectly inferring statistical significance of independent regression variables. Students have expressed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the risks of type I errors through this demonstration. This demonstration is innovative because the scale of the simulation allows the students to experience the near certainty that the correlations shown in the results are truly random. © 2014 Decision Sciences Institute.","Business Analytics; Hypothesis testing; Regression; Simulation","","","","","","","","Buhlmann P., Rutimann P., Kalisch M., Controlling false positive selections in high-dimensional regression and causal inference, Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 22, 5, pp. 466-492, (2011); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Competing on analytics, the new science of winning, (2007); Duffy S., Random numbers demonstrate the frequency of type I errors: Three spreadsheets of class demonstration, Journal of Statistics Education, 18, 2, pp. 1-16, (2010); Ferson W.E., Sarkissian S., Simin T., Asset pricing models with conditional betas and alphas: The effects of data snooping and spurious regression, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 43, 2, pp. 331-354, (2008); Fisher R.A., Statistical methods for research workers, (1925); Fisher R.A., Statistical methods and scientific induction, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 17, 1, pp. 69-78, (1955); Fisher M.L., Raman A., The new science of retailing, how analytics are transforming the supply chain and improving performance, (2010); Gigerenzer G., Mindless statistics, Journal of Socio-Economics, 33, 5, pp. 587-606, (2004); Jordan J., The corporate downside of Big Data, The Wall Street Journal; Journal Report | Leadership on IT, (2013); Kuhl M., Johnson K., Applied predictive modeling, (2013); Meinhausen N., Meier L., Buhlmann P., p-values for high-dimensional regression, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 104, 488, pp. 1671-1681, (2009); Nisbet R., Elder J., Miner G., Handbook of statistical analysis & data mining applications, (2009); Siegel E., Predictive analytics, (2013); Sharpe N.R., DeVeaux R.D., Velleman P.F., Business statistics, (2010); Tversky A., Kahneman D., Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability, Cognitive Psychology, 5, 2, pp. 207-232, (1973); White H., A reality check for data snooping, Econometrica, 68, 5, pp. 1097-1126, (2000)","J.P.

A segmentation index system of ETC customer consisting of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary is constructed and extracted using ETC data. The whole sample clustering analysis of ETC customer is accomplished by CLARA algorithm while overcoming the invalidation problem on big data clustering. The decision tree of ETC customer segmentation is finally built and transformed into a set of segmentation rules. The empirical results indicate that the proposed method has a better ability to analyze the traveling characteristics, present values and appreciation potentials for different classifications of ETC customers. It provides an innovative idea to implement precision marketing and make hierarchical discount rates for ETC customers. Meanwhile, it provides theoretical support to further increase of ETC customer scale and paying ratio, as improve decision-making level in expressway operation and management.

Using three different data sets—the publicly available social media data of over three million brand followerships of Twitter users, a YouGov brand-preference survey data set, and Nielsen scanner panel data—we assess the evolution of brand-preference polarization. We find that the apparent polarization in political ideologies after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 stretches further to the daily lives of consumers. We observe increased polarization in preferences, behavioral intentions, and actual purchase decisions for consumer brands. Consistent with compensatory consumption theory, we find that the increase in polarization following the election of Donald Trump was stronger for liberals relative to conservatives, and that this asymmetric polarization is driven by consumers’ demand for “Democratic brands” rather than the supply of such brands. From a brand perspective, there is evidence that brands that took a political stance observed a shift in their customer base in terms of their customers’ political affiliation. We provide publicly available (http://www.social-listening.org) access to the unique Twitter-based brand political affiliation scores. © 2022 The Author(s).","branding; data mining; political marketing; political polarization; social media","","","","","","Marketing Science Institute, MSI; Università Bocconi","The authors thank the Marketing Science Institute for the 2018–2020 Research Priorities Research Grant Competition grant and Bocconi University for the Junior Research Grant 2019–2020 that provided funding for this project.","Barbera P, Jost JT, Nagler J, Tucker JA, Bonneau R, Tweeting from left to right: Is online political communication more than an echo chamber?, Psych.

Another perspective of this project is to investigate the decision-making process (emotion-focused) that they follow in order to choose a tourist destination via online booking systems. Methods: For the purposes of this study, three scales were administered: E-WOM and Accommodation Scale, Emotion-Based Decision-Making Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Scale. Survey data were collected, preprocessed and analyzed based on Data Mining techniques evaluating the results. More specifically, classification and association algorithms were utilized to manage to describe hidden patterns. Results: Findings showed how development of the Internet have significantly changed the market conditions of tourist organizations providing new tools for tourism marketing and management. It allows interaction between tourist organizations and users and as a result changes the entire process of development, management and marketing in tourism. Implications: There are many opportunities for further research in this field, because the complex nature of human behavior, the constant changes in the environment and the various e-technologies create many chances to tourist companies for innovative activities and use of new and still unrecognized opportunities. © 2020 Authors.","e-Tourism; Expert System; Hotel Selection Factors; Online Booking Systems","","","","","","","","Chatzigeorgiou C., Christou E., Simeli I., Delegate satisfaction from conference service quality and its impact on future behavioural intentions, 5th International Conference on Contemporary Marketing Issues ICCMI, pp. 532-544, (2017); Chaudhry I.S., Khan M.A., Khan N.A., Role of Emotions in Managerial Activities and its Effects on Performance, World Journal of Social Sciences, 2, 4, pp. 303-317, (2012); Chenini A., Touaiti M., Building Destination Loyalty Using Tourist Satisfaction and Destination Image: A Holistic Conceptual Framework, Journal of Tourism, Heritage & Services Marketing, 4, 2, pp. 37-43, (2018); Christou E., Kassianidis P., Examining the Adoption of E-shopping for Travel Services: Determinants of Consumers’ Perceptions, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2002, (2002); Christou E., Nella A., Web 2.0 and pricing transparency in hotel services, Social Media in Travel, Tourism and Hospitality, pp. 133-148, (2016); Gkintoni E., Halkiopoulos C., Antonopoulou H., Togias P., Mitropoulos A., Emotional Intelligence in Social Network Consumers, International Conference on Contemporary Marketing Issues, (2016); Gkintoni E., Halkiopoulos C., Antzoulatos G., Giannopoulou G., Emotional Intelligence Evaluation in Greek Adolescents: A Data Mining Approach, International Conference on Adolescent Medicine and Child Psychology, (2015); Gretzel U., Sigala M., Christou E., Social Media Change the Name of the Game in the Tourism and Hospitality Industries, The European Financial Review, (2012); Li L., Petering M.E.H., Discrete event simulation analysis of a reservation-based, one-way car-sharing system, Journal of Simulation, 12, 1, pp. 1-22, (2018); Maimon O., Rokach L., Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, (2010); Mensah I., Mensah R.D., Effects of Service Quality and Customer Satisfaction on Repurchase Intention in Restaurants on University of Cape Coast Campus, Journal of Tourism, Heritage & Services Marketing, 4, 1, pp. 27-36, (2018); Misirlis M., Lekakos G., Vlachopoulou M., Associating Facebook Measurable Activities with Personality Traits: A Fuzzy Sets Approach, Journal of Tourism, Heritage & Services Marketing, 4, 2, pp. 10-16, (2018); Moro S., Rita P., Oliveira C., Factors Influencing Hotels’ Online Prices, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 27, 4, pp. 443-464, (2018); Murphy D., Increasing clicks through advanced targeting: Applying the third-party seal model to airline advertising, Journal of Tourism, Heritage & Services Marketing, 5, 1, pp. 24-30, (2019); Nair R., George B.P., E-learning adoption in hospitality education: An analysis with special focus on Singapore, Journal of Tourism, Heritage & Services Marketing, 2, 1, pp. 3-13, (2016); Petrides K.

A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

Therefore, a thumbnail needs to be able to tell potential viewers what the video is about (i.e., be informative), and at the same time, a thumbnail needs to grab potential viewers' attention (i.e., be visually appealing). Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we take the visual attributes that are relevant to the informativeness of thumbnails (e.g., element complexity and object complexity) as central route cues, take the visual attributes that are relevant to the aesthetics of thumbnails (e.g., celebrity endorsement, colorfulness, brightness, and image quality) as peripheral route cues, and explore the relation between these visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos using 3,745 marketing videos posted by 38 top brands across 4 industries – the automobile, beverage, restaurant, and toy industries – on YouTube. We construct our variables by extracting features from thumbnails using image mining techniques. Our study contributes to the literature on information systems and marketing by enhancing our understanding of the role of the visual attributes of images in persuading viewers in the online environment. Furthermore, our study provides a possible theoretical basis for studies on information processing and decision support that focus on automatic thumbnail selection. Finally, our study provides useful and practical guidelines for designing templates for optimal thumbnails that grab potential viewers' attention and yield more video views. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Branded video content; Elaboration likelihood model; Image mining; Thumbnails; Video view-through; Visual persuasion","Data mining; Decision support systems; Image enhancement; Marketing; Online systems; Video recording; Branded video content; Elaboration likelihood models; Image-Mining; Online video; Thumbnail; Video contents; Video view-through; Video-platforms; Visual attributes; Visual persuasion; Commerce","","","","","Korea University Business School, KUBS","This study is partially supported by a Korea University Business School Research Grant .

From blogs to social media and online reviews, consumers generate a huge amount of brand-related information that has a decisive potential business value for marketing purposes. Particularly, we focus on online reviews that could have an influence on brand image and positioning. Within this context, and using the usual quantitative star score ratings, a recent stream of research has employed sentiment analysis (SA) tools to examine the textual content of reviews and categorize buyer opinions. Although many SA tools split comments into negative or positive, a review can contain phrases with different polarities because the user can have different sentiments about each feature of the product. Finding the polarity of each feature can be interesting for product managers and brand management. In this paper, we present a general framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, text data mining, and clustering techniques, to obtain new scores based on consumer sentiments for different product features. The main contribution of our proposal is the combination of price and the aforementioned scores to define a new global score for the product, which allows us to obtain a ranking according to product features. Furthermore, the products can be classified according to their positive, neutral, or negative features (visualized on dashboards), helping consumers with their sustainable purchasing behavior. We proved the validity of our approach in a case study using big data extracted from Amazon online reviews (specifically cell phones), obtaining satisfactory and promising results. After the experimentation, we could conclude that our work is able to improve recommender systems by using positive, neutral, and negative customer opinions and by classifying customers based on their comments. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Feature selection; Marketing decisions; Sentiment analysis","creative industry; data mining; decision making; marketing; media role; ranking; social media; sustainable development; valuation; World Wide Web","","","","","Conselleria de Educaci?n; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CloudDriver4Industry TIN2017-89266-R, PROMETEO/2018/089); Conselleria d'Educació, Investigació, Cultura i Esport, (AICO/2017/134)","Funding text 1: Funding: This study was partially funded by the ECLIPSE-UA (RTI2018-094283-B-C32) and RESCATA (TIN2015-65100-R) projects of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and PROMETEO/2018/089.

This study has proposed a brand new and practical fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) based weighted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model for application in K-means algorithm for auto insurance customers' segmentation. The developed methodology has been implemented for a private auto insurance company in Iran which classified customers into four ""best"", ""new"", ""risky"", and ""uncertain"" patterns. Then, association rules among auto insurance services in two most valuable customer segments including ""best"" and ""risky"" patterns are discovered and proposed. Finally, some marketing strategies based on the research results are proposed. The authors believe the result of this paper can provide a noticeable capability to the insurer company in order to assess its customers' loyalty in marketing strategy.

Most commercial companies need to do marketing in social networks in order to introduce their goods and/or services. In marketing, appropriate and accurate advertisement of goods based on needs of users of these social networks is required to sell the goods of different companies and manufacturing units in effective ways. In most cases, however, advertising and marketing methods in social networks are not correct and the resulted advertisements are boring and tiring to users and they might ignore them without noticing. Such advertisements will be considered as spam and will be annoying to network users. This is taken into consideration in the present study where users' interests, attitudes, and behavior on Facebook are specified through data mining techniques, based on which content marketing is conducted. The present study is conducted on the social network of Facebook, where content marketing, a new form of marketing, is utilized and instead of introducing the goods, the contents of different goods are presented. The data utilized in the study are actual and related to Facebook users, and therefore, the results can be generalized to other networks. © 2014, Saman Forouzandeh, Heirsh Soltanpanah, & Amir Sheikhahmadi.","Advertisement; Data mining; Decision tree; Marketing; Social networks","","","","","","","","Bastian M., Heymann S., Jacomy M., Gephi: An open source software for exploring and manipulating networks, Proceedings of the Third International ICWSM Conference, pp. 361-362, (2009); Donath J., Boyd D., Public displays of connection, BT Technology Journal, 22, 4, pp. 71-72, (2004); Forouzandeh S., Sheikhahmadi A., Forouzandeh S., Using data mining techniques to determine the percentage of success and failure in software projects, The sixth Iran Data Mining Conference (IDMC) - Tehran, (2012); Hartline J., Mirrokni V., Sundararajan M., Optimal marketing strategies over social networks, Refereed Track: Internet Monetization - Recommendation & Security, (2008); Jianming H., Wesley W., A social network- based recommender system (SNRS), 12, pp. 47-74, (2010); Jothi P.S., Neelamalar M., Prasad R.S., Analysis of social networking sites: A study on effective communication strategy in developing brand communication, Journal of Media and Communication Studies, 3, 7, pp. 234-242, (2011); Karimzadehgan M., Agrawal M., Zhai C., Towards advertising on social networks, Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR workshop on Information Retrieval and Advertising (IRA), (2009); Qiao Y., Social networks and e-commerce, Seminar on Internetworking, (2008); Ricci F., Rokach L., Shapira B., Kantor P.B., Recommender Systems Handbook., (2011); Rieder B., Studying Facebook via data extraction: The Netvizz application.

However, there is little agreement on what factors are dominating individual information disseminating behavior on SNS, and what’s worse, more and more factors are added into the prediction model, without examining the relevance of them and even why these factors are added is rarely discussed. This leads to undesirable outcomes such as increasing the cost of measuring and computing irrelevant/redundant features. Most importantly, it hinders us from understanding what discriminative features are affecting individual information disseminating behavior. Using a unique real-life Twitter data set consisting of 55,575 twitterers and 9,440,321 tweets, the authors examine what discriminative features are dominating individual information disseminating behavior. The results indicate that topic distance is the most discriminative factor, highlighting that self-presentation motives play an important role in information disseminating decisions. Besides, the amount of information, social relationship and the popularity of the tweet also contribute to individual information disseminating decisions. Experiments demonstrate that adopting only dominating factors can improve prediction performance in terms of various indicators, compared with adopting the full features set. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing theoretical and practical implications of our findings. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017.","Data mining; Dominating features; Individual retweeting decisions; Information disseminating behaviour; Online marketing; Social networking sites","","","","","","","","Allsop D.T., Bassett B.R., Hoskins J.A., Word-of-mouth research: Principles and applications, J Adv Res, 47, 4, pp. 398-411, (2007); Bakshy E., Hofman J.M., Mason W.A., Watts D.J., Everyone’s an Influencer: Quantifying Influence on Twitter, pp. 65-74, (2011); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, J Mark Res, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Cheung C., Thadani D.R., The impact of electronic word-of-mouth communication: A literature analysis and integrative model, Decis Support Syst, 54, 1, pp. 461-470, (2012); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Q, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Deerwester S.C., Dumais S.T., Landauer T.K., Furnas G.W., Harshman R.A., Indexing by latent semantic analysis, J am Soc Inf Sci, 41, 6, pp. 391-407, (1990); Deutsch M., Gerard H.B., A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgment, J Abnorm Soc Psychol, 51, 3, (1955); Evans J.D., Straightforward Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, (1996); Feng W., Wang J., Retweet Or Not?

Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products. With the massive amount of data available from the cloud, which were conventionally made with a high degree of intuition based on decision makers’ knowledge and experience, can now be supported with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach in applying the fuzzy association rule mining approach and the fuzzy logic technique, for discovering the factors influencing the pricing decision of products launched in e-commerce retail site, and in formulating flexible, dynamic pricing strategies for each product launched in an e-commerce site. A pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses, namely Smart-Quo, is developed and implemented in a Hong Kong-based B2B e-commerce retail company. A six-month pilot run reveals a significant improvement in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness in making pricing decisions on each product. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques in marketing management in today’s digital age. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence;

Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns. This paper discusses the use of the data mining concept on marketing. This paper aims to analyze marketing data with k-means data mining clustering techniques and to find the relationship between marketing and k-means data mining clustering techniques. © 2022 Russian Association of Forensic Medical Experts.

Research design, data and methodology: This quantitative research utilizes data-mining techniques and the RFM model to cluster a university's provider schools. The RFM model was modified by adapting its variables to the university's marketing context and adding a district's potential (D) variable based on heatmap analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) and K-means clustering. The K-prototype algorithm and the Elbow method were applied to find provider school clusters using the proposed RFM-D model. After profiling the clusters, the target segment was assigned. The model was validated using empirical data from an Indonesian university, and its performance was compared to the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)-based RFM utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. Results: This research identified five clusters. The target segment was chosen from the highest-value and high-value clusters that comprised 17.80% of provider schools but can contribute 75.77% of students. Conclusions: The proposed model recommended more targeted schools in higher-potential districts and predicted the target segment with 0.99 accuracies, outperforming the CLV-based model. The empirical findings help university management determine the promotion location and allocate resources for promotional information distribution and student recruitment. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://Creat¡vecommons.org/l¡censes/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Information distribution; Rfm; Spatial analysis; Student recruitment; Target market","","","","","","","","Abbasimehr H., Shabani M., A new methodology for customer behavior analysis using time series clustering: A case study on a bank’s customers, Kybernetes, 50, 2, pp. 221-242, (2019); Babaiyan V., Sarfarazi S.

However, despite these advances, relevant evidence on the measures to improve the management of Data Sciences in digital marketing remains scarce. To bridge this gap in the literature, the present study aims to review (i) methods of analysis, (ii) uses, and (iii) performance metrics based on Data Sciences as used in digital marketing techniques and strategies. To this end, a comprehensive literature review of major scientific contributions made so far in this research area is undertaken. The results present a holistic overview of the main applications of Data Sciences to digital marketing and generate insights related to the creation of innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery techniques. Important theoretical implications are discussed, and a list of topics is offered for further research in this field. The review concludes with formulating recommendations on the development of digital marketing strategies for businesses, marketers, and non-technical researchers and with an outline of directions of further research on innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery applications. © 2020 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","Data Mining;

The proposed methodological framework serves as a decision support tool for customer relationship managers or direct marketers to select attractive product categories for their target marketing efforts, such as segment-specific rewards in loyalty programs, cross-merchandising activities, targeted direct mailings, customized supplements in catalogues, or customized promotions. The proposed methodology requires customers’ multi-category purchase histories as input data and proceeds in a stepwise manner. It combines various data compression techniques and integrates an optimization approach which suggests candidate product categories for segment-specific targeted marketing such that cross-category spillover effects for non-promoted categories are maximized. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed procedure, we examine the transactions from a real-world loyalty program of a major grocery retailer. A simple scenario-based analysis using promotion responsiveness reported in previous empirical studies and prior experience by domain experts suggests that targeted promotions might boost profitability between 15 % and 128 % relative to an undifferentiated standard campaign. © 2016, The Author(s).","Association rule mining; Clustering; Cross-category purchases; Customized coupons; Target marketing","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Srikant R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases, pp. 487-499, (1994); Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 207-216, (1993); Ailawadi K.L., Bradlow E.T., Draganska M., Nijs V., Rooderkerk R.P., Sudhir K., Wilbur K.C., Zhang J., Empirical models of manufacturer-retailer interaction: A review and agenda for future research, Market Lett, 21, 3, pp. 273-285, (2010); Aldenderfer M.S., Blashfield R.K., Cluster analysis, quantitative applications in the social sciences, (1984); Anderson C., The long tail: how endless choice is creating unlimited demand, (2006); Basu S., Davidson I., Wagstaff K., Constrained clustering: advances in algorithms, theory, and applications, (2008); Bawa K., Shoemaker R.W., Analyzing incremental sales from a direct mail coupon promotion, J Market, 53, 3, (1989); Bayardo R.J., Agrawal S., Mining the most interesting rules, Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 145-154, (1999); Bell D.R., Chiang J., Padmanabhan V., The decomposition of promotional response: an empirical generalization, Market Sci, 18, 4, pp. 504-526, (1999); Berry J., Bulking up: the 2013 colloquy loyalty census – growth and trends in us loyalty program activity, (2013); Bijmolt T.H.A., van Heerde H.J., Pieters R.G.M., New empirical generalizations on the determinants of price elasticity, J Market Res, 42, 2, pp. 141-156, (2005); Bock H.H., Clustering and neural network approaches, Classification in the information age, Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Conference of the Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e.V., Springer, pp. 42-57, (1999); Bodapati A., Gupta S., A direct approach to predicting discretized response in target marketing, J Market Res, 41, 1, pp. 73-85, (2004); Bodapati A.V., Recommendation systems with purchase data, J Market Res, 45, 1, pp. 77-93, (2008); Boztug Y., Reutterer T., A combined approach for segment-specific analysis of market basket data, EJOR Euro J Operat Res, 187, 1, pp. 294-312, (2008); Brijs T., Swinnen G., Vanhoof K., Wets G., Building an association rules framework to improve product assortment decisions, Data Mining Know Dis, 8, 1, pp. 7-23, (2004); Brusco M.J., Cradit D.J., A variable-selection heuristic for k-means clustering, Psychometrika, 66, 2, pp. 249-270, (2001); Carmone F., Kara A., Maxwell S., A new model to improve market segment definition by identifying noisy variables, J Market Res, 36, 4, pp. 501-509, (1999); Chen Y., Hess J.D., Wilcox R.T., Zhang Z.J., Accounting profits versus marketing profits: a relevant metric for category management, Market Sci, 18, 3, pp. 208-229, (1999); DelVecchio D., Krishnan H.S., Smith D.C., Cents or percent? the effects of promotion framing on price expectations and choice, J Market, 71, 3, pp. 158-170, (2007); Dimitriadou E., Dolnicar S., Weingessel A., An examination of indexes for determining the number of clusters in binary data sets, Psychometrika, 67, 1, pp. 137-160, (2002); Dippold K., Hruschka H., A model of heterogeneous multicategory choice for market basket analysis, Rev Market Sci, 11, 1, pp. 1-31, (2013); Dreze X., Hoch S.J., Exploiting the installed base using cross-merchandising and category destination programs, Int J Res Market, 15, 5, pp. 459-471, (1998); Elberse A., Should you invest in the long tail?

The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Green hotels; Machine learning techniques; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neuro-fuzzy; Satisfaction; Sustainable development; TOPSIS","Malaysia; cluster analysis; data mining; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; service quality; sustainable development; World Wide Web","","","","","Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, (LYC18-02, Xq18A01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771156, 71971145)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71771156 and 71971145, and the 2018 Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, grant number Xq18A01 and LYC18-02","Rahman I., Reynolds D., The influence of values and attitudes on green consumer behavior: A conceptual model of green hotel patronage, Int.

However, the true value of social media data is rarely discovered due to overloaded information. Existing literature in analyzing online hotel reviews mainly focuses on a single data resource, lexicon, and analysis method and rarely provides marketing insights and decision-making information to improve business’ service and quality of products. We propose an integrated framework which includes a data crawler, data preprocessing, sentiment-sensitive tree construction, convolution tree kernel classification, aspect extraction and category detection, and visual analytics to gain insights into hotel ratings and reviews. The empirical findings show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms as well as well-known sentiment classification methods, and achieves high precision (0.95) and recall (0.96). The visual analytics results reveal that Business travelers tend to give lower ratings, while Couples tend to give higher ratings. In general, users tend to rate lowest in July and highest in December. The Business travelers more frequently use negative keywords, such as “rude,” “terrible,” “horrible,” “broken,” and “dirty,” to express their dissatisfied emotions toward their hotel stays in July. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Google trends; Hospitality; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; TripAdvisor; Visual analytics","Decision making; Forestry; Hotels; Quality control; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Visual languages; Visualization; Google trends; Hospitality; NAtural language processing; Social media analytics; TripAdvisor; Visual analytics; Data mining","","","","","","","Aydogan E., Akcayol M.A., A comprehensive survey for sentiment analysis tasks using machine learning techniques, 2016 international symposium on innovations in intelligent systems and applications (INISTA), pp. 1-7, (2016); F.Bangwayo-Skeete P., W.Skeete R., Can google data improve the forecasting performance of tourist arrivals?

If those data can be extracted and analysed properly, companies can fully utilise this rich source of information. They can then convert the data to useful information or knowledge, which can help to formulate their business strategy. This cannot only facilitate marketing research in view of customer behaviour, but can also aid other management disciplines. Operations management (OM) research and practice with the objective to make decisions on product and process design is a fine example. Nevertheless, this line of thought is under-researched. In this connection, this paper explores the role of social media data in OM research. A structured approach is proposed, which involves the analysis of social media comments and a statistical cluster analysis to identify the interrelationships amongst important factors. A real-life example is employed to demonstrate the concept. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cluster analysis; content analysis; operations management; social media","Cluster analysis; Data mining; Marketing; Product design; Social networking (online); Content analysis; Customer behaviour; Marketing research; Operations and production management; Operations management; Social media; Social media datum; Structured approach; Data handling","","","","","","","Agichtein E., Castillo C., Donato D., Gionis A., Mishne G., Finding High-quality Content in Social Media, Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Search and Web Data Mining, pp. 183-194, (2008); Ahlgren P., Jarneving B., Rousseau R., Requirements for a Cocitation Similarity Measure, with Special Reference to Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54, 6, pp. 550-560, (2003); Asur S., Huberman B.A., Predicting the Future with Social Media, Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT), 1, pp. 492-499, (2010); Atkinson A.B., Brandolini A., Promise and Pitfalls in the Use of ‘Secondary’ Data-Sets: Income Inequality in OECD Countries as a Case Study, Journal of Economic Literature, 39, 3, pp. 771-799, (2001); Barragans-Martinez A.B., Costa-Montenegro E., Burguillo J.C., Rey-Lopez M., Mikic-Fonte F.A., Peleteiro A., A Hybrid Content-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Approach to Recommend TV Programs Enhanced with Singular Value Decomposition, Information Sciences, 180, 22, pp. 4290-4311, (2010); Birtolo C., Ronca D., Advances in Clustering Collaborative Filtering by Means of Fuzzy C-Means and Trust, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 17, pp. 6997-7009, (2013); Bouguettaya A., Yu Q., Liu X., Zhou X., Song A., Efficient Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 5, pp. 2785-2797, (2015); Buddhakulsomsiri J., Siradeghyan Y., Zakarian A., Li X., Association Rule-Generation Algorithm for Mining Automotive Warranty Data, International Journal of Production Research, 44, 14, pp. 2749-2770, (2006); Chan H.K., Wang X., Fuzzy Hierarchical Model for Risk Assessment, (2013); Chan H.K., Wang X., White G., Yip N., An Extended Fuzzy-AHP Approach for the Evaluation of Green Product Designs, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 60, 2, pp. 327-339, (2013); Cheung C.F., Li F.L., A Quantitative Correlation Coefficient Mining Method for Business Intelligence in Small and Medium Enterprises of Trading Business, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 7, pp. 6279-6291, (2012); Cheung C.M., Lee M.K., Rabjohn N., The Impact of Electronic Word‐of‐Mouth, Internet Research, 18, 3, pp. 229-247, (2008); Cheung M.Y., Luo C., Sia C.L., Chen H., Credibility of Electronic Word-of-Mouth: Informational and Normative Determinants of on-Line Consumer Recommendations, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 13, 4, pp. 9-38, (2009); Cowton C.J., The Use of Secondary Data in Business Ethics Research, Journal of Business Ethics, 17, 4, pp. 423-434, (1998); Culnan M.J., McHugh P.J., Zubillaga J.I., How Large US Companies Can Use Twitter and Other Social Media to Gain Business Value, MIS Quarterly Executive, 9, 4, pp. 243-259, (2010); Denecke K., Nejdl W., How Valuable is Medical Social Media Data?

Market leaders should take advantage of data analysis consecutively as the need to sustain customers the longest possible time. This research is based on community detection analysis through identifying group members and influencers in the telecommunication industry. It is motivated by two major research questions: Who are th e influencers in subscribers for churn and new products adoptions? (2) Who are subscribers whose loyalty is threatened by churn around them? The use of data analysis and data mining algorithms and standard process in today‘s challenges was set to increase the efficiency of solving not only technical problems but business as to move toward insights and analysis based exercises. This research proposes a model based on the Similarity, Authority and Hub algorithms used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) to group members who share same patterns together, to identify network leaders in terms of authority and dissemination leaders and to extract group level insights that can be used in understanding subscribers‘ patterns and ways of communications (in-degrees and out-degrees) between them using IBM SPSS Modeler as the base of data mining process and Oracle as the base of corporate data warehouse. This study estimated how much reliable is to use SNA in order to shift from the traditional ways of targeting subscribers, understanding their pattern, enhancing offering efficiency and improving the process of launching new product by selecting the right target. It has contributed to shifting marketing leaders‘ way of thinking from individual view to network view. It has also contributed to providing decision makers with a systematic and scientific approach as to focus on network influencers, to save as much as they can and to build their offers based on it. © 2020 IJSTR.","Authority; Data analysis; Data mining; Dissemination; SNA; Social network analysis; SPSS molder; SQL: SPSS Modeler","","","","","","","","Barry W., Berkowitz S., Social Structures: A Network Approach; Freeman L., The Development of Social Network Analysis, (2007); Wasserman S., Faust K., Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications, (1994); Aburezeq W., The Impact of Social Network Analysis On the Palestinian Telecom Industry, Jawwal-Palestine, (2017); Passmore D.L., Social Network Analysis: Theory and Applications, (2011); Fowler H., Christakis A., ""Dynamic Spread of Happiness in a Large Social Network: Longitudinal Analysis over 20,"" 5, (2008); Dasgupta K., Singh R., Viswanathan B., Chakraborty D., Mukherjea S., Nanavati A.A., Social ties and their relevance to churn in mobile telecom networks, University of Maryland Baltimore County, India, (2008); Richter Y., Yom-Tov E., Slonim N., Predicting customer churn in mobile networks through the analysis of social groups, Proceedings of the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining SDM, (2010); Spssinc., CRISP-DM 1.0, SPSS, 2000.; Newman M.E.J., Detecting Community Structure in Networks, (2004); (2008); Partitioning into Groups, (2019); Tong H., Faloutsos C., Pan J.-Y., Random Walk with Restart and Its Applications, (2006); ""Describing Networks,"" IBM Knowledge Center, (2019); Network density, IBM Knowledge Center, (2019); ""About Social Network Analysis,"" IBM Knowledge Center, (2019); Devi P., Gupta A., Dixit A., Comparative Study of HITS and PageRank Link, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 3, 2, (2014); Describing Groups and Group Members, (2019); Spss I., IBM SPSS Modeller, (2013); Feng Y., Application of Data Mining in CRM System, (2007)","R.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected at two different points in time from two different samples but analyzed with the same research question in mind. To increase the robustness and validity of findings, three analytical approaches from the repertoire of statistics and data mining techniques such as hierarchical linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree analysis were applied to two independent samples of tourists with different demographic profiles. This multiple methods research employs a complementary design, as methods used have equal importance and are applied concurrently. Findings: The paper obtained generally consistent results across methods and samples: general animosity, destination image and country image are the most influential factors in the tourists’ decision-making to visit a destination country with which their own country has strained bilateral relations. Practical implications: Destination image is highly important in all analyses and is more favorable than country image. It indicates some degree of separation of the two images in the respondents’ mind, which indicates that marketing a country as a tourist destination on a not-so-friendly tourism market may still be effective. Results also tentatively indicate that for young adults, patriotic feelings matter more in their decision-making, while for more mature tourists, ethnocentric tendencies play a more important role. Originality/value: The paper examines the influence of general and situational animosity, national attachment, and consumer ethnocentrism on visitation intentions in a situation of conflict between the two nations and, thus, expands the empirical evidence accumulated to date on tourist behavior in conflict. The paper acts on the premise that if a connection between any two variables truly exists, it should be able to withstand variations in samples, timing of data collection and measurement, thus, leading to more robust findings. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.","Animosity; Consumer ethnocentrism; Decision tree; Multiple methods research; National attachment","","","","","","","","Alvarez M.D., Campo S., The influence of political conflicts on country image and intention to visit: a study of Israel’s image, Tourism Management, 40, pp. 70-78, (2014); Amine L.S., Country-of-origin, animosity and consumer response: marketing implications of anti-Americanism and Francophobia, International Business Review, 17, 4, pp. 402-422, (2008); Anastasopoulos P.G., Tourism and attitude change: Greek tourists visiting Turkey, Annals of Tourism Research, 19, 4, pp. 629-642, (1992); Askegaard S., Ger G., Product-country images: towards a contextualized approach, ACR European Advances, 3, pp. 50-58, (1998); Becken S., Carmignani F., Does tourism lead to peace?, Annals of Tourism Research, 61, pp. 63-79, (2016); Bouchard T.J.J., Unobtrusive measures: an inventory of uses, Sociological Methods & Research, 4, 3, pp. 267-300, (1976); Campbell D.T., Fiske D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix, Psychological Bulletin, 56, 2, pp. 81-105, (1959); Carpenter S., Psychology’s bold initiative, Science, 335, 6076, pp. 1558-1560, (2012); Cheah I., Phau I., Kea G., Huang Y.A., Modelling effects of consumer animosity: consumers’ willingness to buy foreign and hybrid products, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 30, pp. 184-192, (2016); Chen C.C., Lai Y.H.R., Petrick J.F., Lin Y.H., Tourism between divided nations: an examination of stereotyping on destination image, Tourism Management, 55, pp. 25-36, (2016); Cohen J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Creswell J.W., Clark V.L.P., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, (2017); Cumming G., Understanding the New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis, (2012); D'Amore L., Tourism-the world’s peace industry, Journal of Travel Research, 27, 1, pp. 35-40, (1988); Davis D.F., Golicic S.L., Boerstler C.N., Benefits and challenges of conducting multiple methods research in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 39, 3, pp. 467-479, (2011); De Nisco A., Mainolfi G., Marino V., Napolitano M.R., Effect of economic animosity on consumer ethnocentrism and product-country images.

In this paper, we present an original study on social media data, specifically Twitter, to analyze childhood NGOs, evaluating the success of their content (through the likes obtained by publications) from the perspective of social marketing and prospective theory. In addition, it examines the positioning of organizations concerning the types of messages identified. The methodological approach is based on data mining, content analysis, and simple correspondence analysis through which the typology of the messages and positioning map are determined. The results suggest that these organizations generate predictable communication by publishing on specific topics and only increasing the number of tweets in emergencies when they are requiring urgent help. Some tweets show an immediate risk to which children are exposed if they do not receive help, which aligns with one of the premises of the Prospect Theory. Furthermore, a more significant number of posts does not necessarily imply a greater number of likes. Three types of messages have been determined: informative tweets that point out risks (type 1), impartial dialogue tweets (type 2), and action tweets that highlight benefits (type 3), confirmed through the Kruskal-Wallis test to have a relationship with impact. The positioning map shows that type 3 messages, which World Vision Spain opts for, are the most popular, followed by type 1, which Educo leans towards. Finally, there are those of type 2, with which UNICEF Spain is associated. The main implication is that our analysis validates the use of social media such as Twitter to analyze NGOs and proposes these social media platforms to be an important tool in mobilizing the community. In addition, this study offers parameters when constructing the messages for use in social marketing campaigns according to decisions that involve risk or certainty. © The Author(s) 2024.","","","","","","","","","Arroyo I., Baladron A.J., Martin R., La comunicación en redes sociales: percepciones y usos de las Ong españolas, CuadernosInfo, 32, pp. 77-88, (2020); Accion A.E., Lista De ONG Que Ayudan a niños, (2018); Balaji M.S., Jiang Y., Jha S., Nanoinfluencer marketing: How message features affect credibility and behavioral intentions, J Bus Res, 136, pp. 293-304, (2021); Bardin L., Suarez C., El Analisis De Contenido, (1996); Beh E.J., Simple correspondence analysis: A bibliographic review, Int Stat Rev, 72, 2, pp. 257-284, (2004); Bifarello M.S., Las organizaciones no gubernamentales y las políticas para la infancia en situación de pobreza, Segunda Conferencia Internacional De La Internacional Society for Third Sector., (1996); Social Marketing and Behaviour Change: Models, Theory and Applications.

Additionally, recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM) analysis method is suitable for identifying valuable bank customers. Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns hidden in customer data. However, in previous research, data mining has been used separately in both credit scoring and RFM approaches. To evaluate customer behaviour, banks must employ credit scoring and RFM analysis method, simultaneously. This study proposes a framework for using data mining techniques to integrate credit scoring and RFM methods in the field of banking. In this framework, k-means had better performance than Kohonen network and DBSCAN to identify and cluster valuable customers based on the RFM and credit scoring indices. Moreover, the C5 decision tree, BN, and SVM with 94.10%, 92.71%, and 92.36% accuracy had better performance to classify valuable bank customers based on RFM and credit scoring indices.

This is one of the first research articles to use a data mining tool—namely, decision trees—to analyze the behavior of inbound tourists for the purpose of effective future destination marketing in Japan. The research results of approximately 4,000 observations show that the main motivation for visitors’ future return is not driven by experiences had during their most current visit but rather by experiences anticipated in the future, such as visiting hot springs or immersing themselves in beautiful natural settings. The data mining method largely excludes the possibility of the intrusion of researcher subjectivity and is conducive to useful discoveries of certain visitor patterns in large data sets, providing governments and destination marketing organizations with additional tools to better formulate effective destination marketing strategies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","big data analysis; data mining; decision trees; Japan; quantitative destination marketing","Japan; data mining; marketing; quantitative analysis; tourism market; tourist destination","","","","","","","Ahmed Z.U., The Influence of the Components of a State’s Tourist Image on Product Positioning Strategy, Tourism management, 12, 4, pp. 331-340, (1991); Alegre J., Garau J., The Factor Structure of Tourist Satisfaction at Sun and Sand Destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 1, pp. 78-86, (2011); Apte C., Weiss S., Data Mining with Decision Trees and Decision Rules, Future Generation Computer Systems, 13, 2, pp. 197-210, (1997); Assaker G., Vinzi V.E., O'Connor P., Examining the Effect of Novelty Seeking, Satisfaction, and Destination Image on Tourists’ Return Pattern: A Two Factor, Non-linear Latent Growth Model, Tourism Management, 32, 4, pp. 890-901, (2011); Athiyaman A., Knowledge Development in Tourism: Tourism Demand Research, Tourism Management, 18, 4, pp. 221-228, (1997); Bajs I.P., Tourist Perceived Value, Relationship to Satisfaction, and Behavioral Intentions the Example of the Croatian Tourist Destination Dubrovnik, Journal of Travel Research, 54, 1, pp. 122-134, (2015); Baloglu S., McCleary K.W., US International Pleasure Travelers’ Images of Four Mediterranean Destinations: A Comparison of Visitors and Nonvisitors, Journal of Travel Research, 38, 2, pp. 144-152, (1999); Berry M.J., Linoff G., Mastering Data Mining, (2000); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., The Odds Ratio, British Medical Journal, 320, 7247, (2000); Brown T.J., Barry T.E., Dacin P.A., Gunst R.F., Spreading the Word: Investigating Antecedents of Consumers’ Positive Word-of-Mouth Intentions and Behaviors in a Retailing Context, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33, 2, pp. 123-138, (2005); Buhalis D., Information Technology as a Strategic Tool for Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Benefits Enhancement of Tourism at Destination Regions, Progress in Tourism and Hospitality Research, 3, 1, pp. 71-93, (1997); Buhalis D., Strategic Use of Information Technologies in the Tourism Industry, Tourism Management, 19, 5, pp. 409-421, (1998); Buhalis D., Tourism on the Greek Islands: Issues of Peripherality, Competitiveness and Development, International Journal of Tourism Research, 1, 5, pp. 341-358, (1999); Buhalis D., Marketing the Competitive Destination of the Future, Tourism Management, 21, 1, pp. 97-116, (2000); Buhalis D., Law R., Progress in Information Technology and Tourism Management: 20 Years on and 10 Years after the Internet—The State of eTourism Research, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 609-623, (2008); Campelo A., Aitken R., Gnoth J., Visual Rhetoric and Ethics in Marketing of Destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 1, pp. 3-14, (2011); Chang K., Chen M., Kuo N., Hsu C., Cheng Y., Applying Data Mining Methods to Tourist Loyalty Intentions in the International Tourist Hotel Sector, Anatolia: An International Journal of Tourism & Hospitality Research, 27, 2, pp. 271-274, (2016); Chen C.F., Tsai D., How Destination Image and Evaluative Factors Affect Behavioral Intentions?, Tourism Management, 28, 4, pp. 1115-1122, (2007); Chi C.G.Q., Qu H., Examining the Structural Relationships of Destination Image, Tourist Satisfaction and Destination Loyalty: An Integrated Approach, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 624-636, (2008); De Reyck B., Degraeve Z., Vandenborre R., Project Options Valuation with Net Present Value and Decision Tree Analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 184, 1, pp. 341-355, (2008); Duncan R., What Is the Right Organization Structure?

A review of big data usage in retail stores was conducted along with a document-based descriptive analysis of secondary data and further critical literature analysis. Decision making strategies and flow charts were used for the development of competitiveness methodology by referring to a case of a supermarket chain. Customer segmentation researchers analyse mainly the algorithms or behaviour pattern behind the clustering process; however, neither of them offers a proper strategy for implementing a realtime customer segmentation process inside the enterprise. Sustainable competitiveness advantage may be achieved by implementing the segmentation theory with concepts of data mining and internet of things (Iot). The process of developed data mining shows many ways for the enterprise to maximize competitiveness. However, time and large investments may be required to develop proper methods for unique solutions. A concrete case study of the selected retail store should be analysed before implementing the real-time customer segmentation methodology inside the enterprise. There is a multicultural population in every market that has different culture, beliefs, preferences and shopping patterns; therefore, constant analysis is essential for efficient usage of customer segmentation. Practically none of the prior research results carried out by other authors offered a concrete methodology how to implement real-time customer's segmentation inside the enterprise. The authors created such a methodology that can provide sustainable long-term competitiveness advantage.","Big data concept; Competitiveness; Customer segmentation; Marketing; Retail sales","","","","","","","","Brito P.Q., Soaresb C., Almeidab S., Montea A., Byvoetc M., Customer segmentation in a large database of an online customized fashion business, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 36, 1, pp. 93-100, (2015);

The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted. Finally, this work shows and compares the classification results obtained with the combination of sampling techniques and Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and Artificial Neural Networks. The testing approach follows a walk-forward validation procedure, which simulates a production environment and reveals the ability to accurately classify each future campaign. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","direct marketing;

By using the developed formal model and the performed critical analysis of methods and technologies for predicting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency, we have built a general architecture of the content processing system that acquires data from different cryptocurrency Internet stock exchanges. General functional requirements to the intelligent cryptocurrency system that target the Internet users have been stated. We have investigated methods, models, and tools to improve the effective support for developing structural elements in the model of a decision support system that manages content according to the user's needs. general architectures of the backend and frontend parts of an intelligent cryptocurrency system have been devised. We also developed software for the system of integration and generation of content considering the cryptocurrency needs of users. An analysis of results of experimental verification of the proposed method for content integration and generation taking into consideration the cryptocurrency needs of users has been performed. A special feature of the system is that it analyzes information from social media and builds a forecast of currency rates based on the acquired information. A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate. The focus of the system is on the frequency of updates at the speed of data aggregation from the Internet stock exchanges and social networks. © 2019, V. Lytvyn, V. Vysotska, V. Kuchkovskiy, I.

This type of industry is subject to influences which over time, modify the perceptions of those involved in the design process due to the fact that they face problems that have both objective and subjective characteristics. In this study the authors used interviews, direct observation methodology, and theoretical argumentation to obtain the experts knowledge as they describe the problems that arise in the process of garment design for Mexican markets. The purpose of this paper is to generate a methodology so that the expert in this field will become highly specialized, resulting in heightened abilities and reinforcing them with the methodology of soft systems and the design management model (DMM). The results suggest that they are applicable to any area of design. Design/methodology/approach – The success or failure of expert system (ES) depends directly on the acquisition of knowledge (Méndez-Gurrola, 2007, 2012), to accomplish that, three large groups of techniques are used to extract that knowledge: manual, semiautomatic, and automatic. Within the group of manual techniques, interviews, protocol analysis, questionnaires, direct on site observation, and the extraction of closed curves are emphasized. This technique is chosen for its ability to extract the particular type of knowledge being sought. The knowledge of the dominion expert in the design process applied to the clothing industry in México is based on processes and at the same time is episodic, meaning that part of the procedure is automated and each step of the process triggers the next. This knowledge is also based on experience which is of an autobiographical nature. Findings – First, when one simulates human behavior, the hardest thing is to choose a knowledge representation that conforms as closely as possible to its emulation. According to, choosing a given type of knowledge representation is an art that is discovered little by little. And this is true as one designs and assembles a representation, when one realizes how far the authors are from imitating the design of the human brain processes, and discovers or invents methodologies to achieve it, combining the results of investigations into knowledge representation, cognitive psychology, and cognitive engineering. Second, solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process. One needs the ability to identify the signals emitted by complex situations, and being able to stop them in time before they create irreversible damage. By merging the soft system methodology (SSM) and DMM with the experts’ abilities and knowledge (the result being the EXITUS model (EM)), makes knowledge modeling possible. A problem cannot be solved if it is unknown, if the problem persists and grows it becomes more complex. By describing a problem, based on: its origin, its relationship, and its effects, it also confers the ability to solve it. Thereby, an SBC with the characteristics presented in this paper, not only improves the design process function as a whole, it also contributes to achieving corporate success. Finally, it influences directly on: a quality product; market positioning; and good economic results. First, the SBC-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the SBC-EXITUS system, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Fourth, in this project an SBC named SBC-EXITUS has been implemented using the SSM and the DMM, with the purpose of detecting possible problems in the design process of the clothing industry. Its implementation is developed by the use of production rules. Fifth, utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation thnique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to other areas of design. Practical implications – Utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation technique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to the garment industry in the international context, as well as to other areas of design such as architecture, furniture, and others. The EM is a generic methodology. In this research and case, it has been applied in a design process within the garment industry, specifically in a case in Mexico. Yet this does not limit its use in a different context and problem situation. Having in mind the difference between countries in aspects such as sponsoring, technology, worker skills, marketing, etc. the tools for diagnostics in the Appendix 2, may be adapted to each context with enriched questions directed to specific aspects involved. Every new application allows facts and production rules that make the use of ES more efficient. Social implications – The ES-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the ES-EXITUS, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Originality/value – Solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process. One needs the ability to identify the signals emitted by complex situations, and being able to stop them in time before they create irreversible damage.

Consumers' demand for experiential shopping has led to the formation of a new sales pattern, and the O2O sales model emphasizing experiential marketing has become a hot topic of common concern in the business and academic circles. The formulation of product quality level and sales service level strategies by enterprises is often affected by both consumers’ behaviors and supply chain members’ behaviors: On the one hand, considering the influence of the difference between the reference level and the actual experience level on consumer demand, this paper incorporates both the reference quality effect of online consumers and the reference service effect on offline channels into goodwill dynamics and demand function of consumers. On the other hand, supply chain members often do not comply with the assumption of “economic man” in traditional economics when they interact with each other, While they often have a certain social preference - reciprocity altruism, that is, they not only consider their own benefits, but also pay attention to each other's benefits to a certain extent. For this reason, this paper regards the utilities maximization of reciprocity altruism as the objectives of supply chain members when making decisions. To sum up, considering the inherent dynamics of supply chain operation and consumers’ reference effects in the supply chain system under O2O mode which is composed of a dominated manufacturer and a retailer selling through both online and offline, the differential game models among decentralized, centralized and reciprocal altruistic decision-making pattern are constructed by using differential game theory, manufacturer's quality level strategy, retailer's dominant service level strategy, and supply chain's profits and utilities are obtains among three decision-making modes. Through comparison, we find that: 1) The reference effects of consumers cause the “anchoring psychology”, which leads to manufacturers' lowering quality level, retailers' lowering service level, and also damages the performance of the product-service supply chain. 2) Consumer's channel preference has an important impact on supply chain members' strategies and performance. Retailers should encourage consumers to purchase products online and use offline channel services as sales assistance measures to satisfy consumers' experience utility. 3) Members' reciprocal altruistic behavior as a positive social preference can obtain Pareto improvement in supply chain performance compared with decentralized decision-making model. and also result in additional social benefits; 4) If and only if both manufacturer and retailer have pure altruistic behavior preferences, i. e. the lowest return and the highest altruism, the total profit of supply chain can reach the situation of centralized decision-making. To this end, the management inspiration of this paper is: due to many management drawbacks of centralized decision-making, such as high management costs and difficulty in implementation, supply chain members should actively display the social preferences of mutual benefit and altruism, and deepen the vertical cooperation of supply chain on the basis of independent decision-making. On the one hand, manufacturer can improve product quality through product innovation, strictly control product quality to enhance brand goodwill, form quality identity and lay a good quality foundation for retailer sales links. On the other hand, retailer should undertake the sales link of supply chain to serve consumers' experience consumption: recommending personalized products to customers at lower cost through advanced technologies such as data mining, setting up 24-hour online customer service, solving customers' pre-sale doubts, reducing the adverse effects of reference service in online channel. While in offline channel, he can establish a reasonable membership system, take feedback promotion activities regularly and feed old customers to improve their retention rate and loyalty, even use word-of-mouth effect to attract new customers and tap new consumer market potential. Through the mutual benefits and altruism of manufacturer and retailer, the supply chain division of labor can be carried out to comprehensively improve the quality level and service capacity from the production end to the sales end, build brand goodwill, and promote win-win situation in all channels. © 2021.

Additionally, this research shows a message classification model, based on the aforementioned characteristics, that has generated a greater impact, offering clarity to tourism managers on the type of content they should publish to achieve greater visibility. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in this work combines content analysis and data mining techniques. The classification tree using the chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm was selected to determine predictors of like behaviour. Findings: The results show that the predictor variables have been emotions, social marketing and topics. Also, the characteristics of the messages most likely to have a high impact are those related to emotions of joy or happiness, their purpose is behavioural, and they talk about rural, cultural issues, special dates, getaways, or highlights of a town or city for something specific. Originality/value: This study is the first to analyze the content of the tweets shared by destination tourism managers from a social marketing, positive emotions, and sustainability perspective, determining the possible predictors of likes on Twitter. The authors contribute to the literature by deepening the understanding of how social marketing and the positive emotions promoted drive a more significant impact in tourism communication campaigns on social media.

The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

This study aims to identify a university's promotional target market for student recruitment and develop a geo-marketing strategy. This study employed a modified RFM model tailored to the university's marketing context, combining it with spatial analysis to quantify feeder schools ""value"" and temporal analysis to examine the enrollment patterns of the highest value feeder schools using data mining techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS). A case study of an Indonesian university was used in this study. This study identified 108 (4.63%) out of 2,334 feeder schools as the prioritized target market, contributing 51.54% of 18,537 enrolled students to the university during the analysis period. The prioritized feeder schools are in 32 cities and 23 regencies from 368 cities/regencies, with the majority being private schools. The research's findings revealed the distribution of feeder schools in regencies/cities and the trend of enrolled students from the highest value feeder schools segment, which can assist university management in selecting target feeder schools more precisely. Based on the findings, decision-makers can create a geo-marketing strategy for promotional activities and direct resources to the prioritized feeder schools. This study contributes by reinforcing a modified RFM model with spatial and temporal analysis to help university decision-makers choose feeder schools as the university's target market and develop a geo-marketing strategy. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

Such analytics can produce useful insights into the attractions of interest to travellers or visitation patterns of a demographic group. Based on these insights, strategic decision-making by travel marketing agents, such as travel package design, may be improved. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an original method of location analytics to analyse travellers' social media data for improving managerial decision support. The method proposes an architectural framework that combines emerging pattern data mining techniques with image processing to identify and process appropriate data content. The design artefact is evaluated through a focus group and a detailed case study of Australian outbound travellers. The proposed method is generic, and can be applied to other specific locations or demographics to provide analytical outcomes useful for strategic decision support. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.","geotagged data; location analytics; social media; Travel agency; travel marketing","Commerce; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Image processing; Marketing; Population statistics; Social networking (online); Architectural frameworks; Demographic groups; Geotagged datum; Managerial decision; Social media; Strategic decision making; Strategic decisions; Travel agency; Location","","","","","","","3401.0-Overseas Arrivals and Departures, Australia, June, (2016); Location Analytics: The Next Big Step in Business Analysis, (2012); Ayres J., Gehrke J., Yiu T., Flannick J., Sequential pattern mining using a bitmap representation, Proceedings of the Eighth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, pp. 429-435, (2002); Baskerville R.L., Kaul M., Storey V.C., Genres of inquiry in design science research: Justification and evaluation of knowledge production, MIS Quarterly, 39, 3, pp. 541-564, (2015); Baskerville R.L., Lyytinen K., Sambamurthy V., Straub D., A response to the design-oriented information systems research memorandum, European Journal of Information Systems, 20, 1, pp. 11-15, (2010); Bay H., Ess A., Tuytelaars T., Gool L.V., Speeded-up robust features, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 110, 3, pp. 346-359, (2008); Blazquez J.J., Molina A., Esteban A., Key quality attributes according to the tourist product, European Journal of Tourism Research, 5, 2, pp. 166-170, (2012); Bowman A.W., Azzalini A., Applied Smoothing Techniques for Data Analysis: The Kernel Approach with S-Plus Illustrations, Oxford Statistical Science Series, 18, (1997); Capdevila J., Arias M., Arratia A., GeoSRS: A hybrid social recommender system for geolocated data, Information Systems, 57, pp. 111-128, (2016); Chua A., Servillo L., Marcheggiani E., Moere A.V., Mapping Cilento: Using geotagged social media data to characterize tourist flows in southern Italy, Tourism Management, 57, pp. 295-310, (2016); Dang Y., Zhand Y., Hu P.J.H., Brown S.A., Ku Y., Wang J.H., Chen H., An integrated framework for analyzing multilingual content in Web 2.0 social media, Decision Support Systems, 61, pp. 126-135, (2014); Dong G., Li J., Efficient mining of emerging patterns: Discovering trends and differences, Proceedings of the Fifth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, San Diego, CA, USA, pp. 43-52, (1999); Fotis J., Buhalis D., Rossides N., Social media use and impact during the holiday travel planning process, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism, pp. 13-24, (2012); Furmanov K., Balaeva O., Predvoditeleva M., Tourism flows from the Russian federation to the European Union, Anatolia-An International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research, 23, 1, pp. 17-31, (2012); Garber L., Analytics goes on location with new approaches, Computer, 46, pp. 14-17, (2013); Gregor S., Hevner A.R., Positioning and presenting design science research for maximum impact, MIS Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 337-355, (2013); Gregor S., Jones D., The anatomy of a design theory, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8, 5, pp. 312-335, (2007); Hevner A., March S., Park J., Ram S., Design science in information systems research, MIS Quarterly, 28, 1, pp. 75-105, (2004); Hirota M., Endo M., Yokoyama S., Ishikawa H., Visualizing shooting spots using geo-tagged photographs from social media sites, EGC 2015, RNTI-E 28, pp. 167-178, (2015); Huang A., Gallegos L., Lerman K., Travel analytics: Understanding how destination choice and business clusters are connected based on social media data, Transportation Research Part C, 77, pp. 245-256, (2017); Iivari J., A paradigmatic analysis of information systems as a design science, Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems, 19, 2, pp. 39-64, (2007); Jiang S., Chen H., Nunamaker J.F., Zimbra D., Analyzing firm-specific social media and market: A stakeholder-based event analysis framework, Decision Support Systems, 67, pp. 30-39, (2014); Kim H.B., Park J.H., Lee S.K., Jang S., Do expectations of future wealth increase outbound tourism?

Analyzing and measuring WoM is quite valuable in product design, sales prediction, marketing strategy, and other decision-making tasks. In contrast to previous studies that analyze product WoM focusing on a single product, we propose an influence framework to measure WoM from a market perspective. In this framework, we combine product competition relationships and customer intercommunication relationships to construct a two-layer network and calculate the node influence effects in the network. To compare different product WoM measures, we use product sales as a predictor and build a series of predictive models. In the experiments conducted based on Amazon.com data, we find that, first, textual sentiment analysis produces a better summary of customer opinions than rating scores. Second, product-comparative relationships provide additional information on measuring product WoM. Third, the customer intercommunication feature in social media is useful for measuring the collective opinions about a product. The influence framework and experimental findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Product network; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth","Commerce; Data mining; Decision making; Marketing; Network layers; Sales; Product networks; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth; Product design","","","","","","","Yang C., Et al., Understanding online consumer review opinion with sentiment analysis using machine learning, Pac.

The challenge for tourism and culture is to reach those diverse audiences through a multicultural marketing perspective for managers to make decisions. Therefore, learning the activity preferences of tourism experiences and creating the value of indigenous tourism by strategies are essential indicators of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The knowledge lacks cultural understanding and the acceptance of prices concerned with indigenous tourism. This research introduces the value of cultural experience into indigenous tourism experiences and establishes a link between the attributes of tourists' preferences and tourism. The data mining methods are used to analyze relevant indigenous tribal data on the cultural experience. Findings: By providing a different quality of service for various tourists, it is expected to improve the sustainable tourism of the tribe through the experiential value of different attributes and strategies of push–pull factors. Research limitations/implications: The experiential activities are based on second-hand data collected from Taitung's indigenous tourism activities, and sample data are the domestic tourism experiences of tourists over the past year. Through empirical analyses, the attributes of tourists' preferences can create the value of the cultural experience for indigenous tourism. Originality/value: This research explores how indigenous cultural experience can be communicated via learning the value of cultural experience to formulate effective strategies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Activity;

Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior. To reach the main goal we perform a data analysis of the online sales data by using machine learning methods as clustering, decision tree and association rules mining. After evaluating the proposed model, we discuss its use of the proposed model in the field of internet sales in the agricultural sector.; JEL Classification: C53, D11, D91, M21, M31 © 2020","association rules; Classification; consumer behavior; data analysis; online shopping","artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; data set; electronic commerce; machine learning; marketing","","","","","Grant Agency for Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport","Intelligence within Network Economy” (Contract No. 1/0201/19) funded by Grant Agency for Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.","Adamov Abzetdin Z., Mining Term Association Rules from Unstructured Text in Azerbaijani Language, 2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT), pp. 1-4, (2018); Alfian G., Ijaz M.

For example, because information technology has advanced and data-storage costs have declined, for the purpose of serving customers, numerous enterprises have employed information systems and have directly logged customer behavior in databases. This trend has motivated the development of data mining applications. Fuzzy quantitative sequential pattern mining is a functional data mining technique that is used for discovering customer behavioral patterns over time and determining the quantities of goods or services they purchase. The example term used in shopping 〈[(Beer, Low)(Milk, High)] (Cola, Middle)〉 means that customers will first buy Beer and Milk in Low and High quantities, respectively, and then purchase Cola in Middle quantities on their next shopping trip, where Low, Middle, and High are predefined linguistic terms assigned by managers. A term such as this one provides managers with general and concise knowledge related to customer behavior and allows them to rapidly make decisions in response, especially in a competitive setting. However, literature searches indicate that no previous study has addressed the issue of changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. The aforementioned example pattern might have been available last year but might not be used this year, and it could have been substituted by 〈(Beer, Middle) {(Cola, Low)(Milk, Low)}〉. If this knowledge is not renewed, managers might develop inappropriate marketing plans for their products or services and use inventory strategies that are outdated with respect to time and quantities. To solve this problem, we propose a novel change-mining model that can be used for detecting changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. We conducted experiments in which we used real-world and synthetic datasets in order to evaluate the proposed model. When the pattern change was detected using the real-world dataset, the results showed that the model reveals 3 considerations that can help managers with their handling of products’ marketing and production. When we studied the model’s scalability by using the synthetic dataset, the results showed that even though all run times increased when parameter values were decreased, the model remained scalable. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Change mining; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Quantitative data; Sequential patterns","","","","","","National Science Council Taiwan; National Science Council, NSC, (NSC 99-2410-H-194-063-MY2)","The authors would like to thank the Editors-in-Chief, Dr. Raymond A.

While retail analytics plays an increasingly important role in successful retailing management, comprehensive store segmentation based on Data Mining-based Retail Analytics is still an under-researched area. This study seeks to address this gap by developing a novel approach to segment the stores of retail chains based on ‘purchasing behavior of customers’ and applying it in a case study. The applicability and benefits of using Data Mining techniques to examine purchasing behavior and identify store segments are demonstrated in a case study of a global retail chain in Istanbul, Turkey. Over 600 K transaction data of a global grocery retailer are analyzed and 175 stores in Istanbul are successfully segmented into five segments. The results suggest that the proposed new retail analytics approach enables the retail chain to identify clusters of stores in different regions using all transaction data and advances our understanding of store segmentation at the store level. The proposed approach will provide the retail chain the opportunity to manage store clusters by making data-driven decisions in marketing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, inventory management and demand forecasting. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business analytics; Data mining; data-driven decision making; purchasing behavior; store segmentation","","","","","","","","Aeron H., Kumar A., Moorthy J., Data Mining Framework for Customer Lifetime Value-based Segmentation, Journal of Database Marketing & Customer Strategy Management, 19, 1, pp. 17-30, (2012); Annie L., Charlet M.C., Kumar A.D., Market Basket Analysis for a Supermarket Based on Frequent Itemset Mining, International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI), 9, 5, (2012); Bajari P., Nekipelov D., Ryan S.P., Yang M., Machine Learning Methods for Demand Estimation, American Economic Review, 105, 5, pp. 481-485, (2015); Balakrishnan J., Cheng C.-H., Wong K.-F., Woo K.-H., Product Recommendation Algorithms in the Age of Omnichannel retailing–An Intuitive Clustering Approach, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 115, pp. 459-470, (2018); Bermingham P., Hernandez T., Clarke I., Network Planning and Retail Store Segmentation: A Spatial Clustering Approach, International Journal of Applied Geospatial Research (IJAGR), 4, 1, pp. 67-79, (2013); Bornac G., The Power of Store Clustering, (2015); Boston R.P., 1st Annual Merchandise Planning & Allocation Benchmark Survey, Boston Retail Partners, (2012); Carvalho J.C., Cardoso P., Crespo L.C., Henriques S., Carvalho R., Gomes P., Biogeographic Patterns of Spiders in Coastal Dunes along a Gradient of Mediterraneity, Biodiversity and Conservation, 20, 4, pp. 873-894, (2011); Chang H.H., Wong K.H., Fang P.W., The Effects of Customer Relationship Management Relational Information Processes on Customer-based Performance, Decision Support Systems, 66, pp. 146-159, (2014); Chen L.-F., Tsai C.-T., Data Mining Framework Based on Rough Set Theory to Improve Location Selection Decisions: A Case Study of A Restaurant Chain, Tourism Management, 53, pp. 197-206, (2016); Chiang, Luke L.-L., Yang C.-S., Does Country-of-origin Brand Personality Generate Retail Customer Lifetime Value?

This paper concentrates on customers' perceptions as a rich, systematic, objective, and intelligent source that supplies strategic marketing planning knowledge. This idea is executed through distilling a perceptual map from mining customers' perceptions via data mining techniques and tools. In this paper, a practical intelligence framework is proposed to integrate marketing resources and information systems techniques in order to maintain a deep understanding of the soundness of data. After application on a real case study for fast food restaurants brands in Jordan, the proposed framework has proven to display promising results. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Brand associations;

The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information. The resultant data aids in creating autonomous systems that consider the input from customers and prepare restaurant strategies. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Accuracy; Aspect-based; Classification; Document-based; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Uncertain feedback pool","Data mining; Decision making; Information retrieval systems; Lakes; Machine learning; Accuracy; Aspect-based; Decision-making process; Document-based; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Smart classification; Specific tasks; Uncertain feedback pool; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Chen H., Salem A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages, ACM Transact Inf Syst, 26, 3, pp. 1-34, (2008); Boire R., Data Mining Process.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers 'preference indicator. © 2023 All rights reserved","Consumers'preferences; Data mining; Decision trees; Decision-making; Shopping behaviour indicators","","","","","","Sveučilište u Rijeci, UNIRI","This paper is supported through project ZIP-UNIRI-2023-14 by the University of Rijeka","AbdulHussein A., Cozzarin B., Dimitrov S., Changes in consumer spending behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic across product categories, Electron Commerce Research, (2022); Anderson R.

Improving the efficiency of the distribution industry is important as an intermediary link between the manufacturer and the consumer, which has an important share of the cost. One of the factors that help this is the use of modern technologies to manage bulk sales data of customers and find important variables on their purchases’ behaviours. In this study, first data mining methods are used to segment the pharmaceutical industry customers based on the RFML model and then these results are evaluated. In the following, in order to help decision-makers and marketing managers of this industry, practical suggestions are presented for each group of the customers. The results could help marketing and sales managers of this industry to have more effective planning for each customer segment and developing their future program for their visitors.

The case study is based on two data sets, aiming to compare the different customer segments, both from sport retail industry, and represents an application of data mining techniques in a business environment. The customer segmentation enables the customer selection for the future direct marketing campaigns based on the previous purchasing behavior. Analyzing the customers’ purchasing history can help the company determine the value of each customer and therefore target or not target such customers in the future with promotional materials, based on both the customers’ interests and their value. Thus, based on the results, personalized offers can be created for each of the defined customer groups, which may increase the efficiency of the overall campaign, reduce costs, and increase profitability.

Design/methodology/approach: This research delves into how nonprofit institutions, specifically business interest associations (BIAs), have developed their internet presence by applying essential digital marketing techniques. To this end, and using big data mining tools, this study analyzes the tracking by internet users of 102 BIAs, with their respective websites in 36 countries in Europe and the USA. In addition, the presence and activity of the institutions included in this study on social networks are considered. Findings: This research serves as a basis for discussing the current gap between social reality and the digitalization of institutions. In this sense, conclusions are drawn on the importance of managerial profiles in decision-making on digitization and the necessary knowledge that, together with Web and social network managers, they must have to articulate the means and techniques that promote the internet presence of the organizations they manage. Originality/value: Conclusions are drawn according to the geographical scope of the BIAs, and an argument is made about the difficulties of connection and loss of prominence of this type of institutions among their different target audiences, especially among the youngest and most digitized. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business interest associations;

These models are built using databases of previous customers’ buying decisions. However, a smaller number of customers in these databases often bought the product or service than those who did not do so, resulting in unbalanced datasets. This problem is especially significant for online marketing campaigns when the class imbalance emerges due to many website sessions. Unbalanced datasets pose a specific challenge in data-mining modelling due to the inability of most of the algorithms to capture the characteristics of the classes that are unrepresented in the dataset. This paper proposes an approach based on a combination of random undersampling and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification applied to the unbalanced dataset to create a Balanced SVM (B-SVM) data pre-processor resulting in a dataset that is analysed with several classifiers. The experiments indicate that using the B-SVM strategy combined with classification methods increases the base models’ predictive performance, indicating that the B-SVM approach efficiently pre-processes the data, correcting noise and class imbalance. Hence, companies may use the B-SVM approach to more efficiently select customers more likely to respond to a campaign. © 2022 by the authors.","customer response model; data mining; data pre-processing; direct marketing; support vector machine; unbalanced data","","","","","","","","Hauser W.J., Orr L., Daugherty T., Customer response models: What data predicts best, hard or soft?, Mark.

Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.

Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework is successful, with higher accuracies and good performance. Results revealed that customer service & marketing tactics are essential for a Company’ success & survival. Also, the C4.5 has accomplished better achievement than the SVM, RF, LR, NB, & ID3. At the end, CIoT Platform was evaluated by response time, request rate & processing of bank data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Analysis; Artificial intelligence (AI); CIoT; Data of bank; Marketing; SDM","Cloud analytics; Commerce; Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Marketing; Support vector machines; Analyse; Artificial intelligence; Cloud internet of thing; Data of bank; Logistics regressions; Marketing information; Naive bayes; Performance; Smart data mining; SMART datum; Internet of things","","","","","","","Bai Y., Zhao M., Li R., Xin P., A new data mining method for time series in visual analysis of regional economy, Information Processing & Management, 59, 1, (2022); Huang M.H., Rust R.T., A strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 49, 1, pp. 30-50, (2021); Li W., Big Data Precision Marketing Approach under IoT Cloud Platform Information Mining, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022); Elsalamony H.A., Bank direct marketing analysis of data mining techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 85, 7, pp. 12-22, (2014); Lai M., Smart financial management system based on data ming and man-machine management, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2022, (2022); Elsalamony H.A., Elsayad A.M., Bank direct marketing based on neural network and C5. 0 Models, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology (IJEAT), 2, 6, (2013); Kim S., Suh Y., Lee H., What IoT devices and applications should be connected?

Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers a conceptual overview of potential opportunities and changes to the study of consumer behavior that Big Data will likely bring. Findings – Big Data have the potential to further our understanding of each stage in the consumer decision-making process. While the field has traditionally moved forward using a priori theory followed by experimentation, it now seems that the nature of the feedback loop between theory and results may shift under the weight of Big Data. Research limitations/implications – A new data culture is now represented in marketing practice. The new group advocates inductive data mining and A/B testing rather than human intuition harnessed for deduction. The group brings with it interest in numerous secondary data sources. However, Big Data may be limited by poor quality, unrepresentativeness and volatility, among other problems. Practical implications – Managers who need to understand consumer behavior will need a workforce with different skill sets than in the past, such as Big Data consumer analytics. Originality/value – To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first articles to assess how the study of consumer behavior can evolve in the context of the Big Data revolution. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Big Data;

How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.","Competencies; Data mining; Information and communication strategy; Marketing intelligence; Small and medium-sized companies; Web mining","","","","","","","","Antlova K., Motivation and Barriers of ICT Adoption in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, E+M Ekonomie a Management, 22, 2, pp. 140-154, (2009); Antlova K., Popelinsky L., Predicting Information System Competencies In Small and Medium Enterprises With Data Mining Methods, Proceedings of IASK Intl.

In order to embrace all business opportunities, enhance the competitiveness, discovery of hidden knowledge, unexpected patterns and useful rules from large databases have provided a feasible solution for several decades. While there is a wide range of financial analysis products existing in the financial market, how to customize the investment portfolio for the customer is still a challenge to many financial institutions. This paper aims at developing an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) for extracting customer behavior in the financial industry, so as to increase the availability of decision support data and hence increase customer satisfaction. The proposed financial model first clusters the customers into several sectors, and then finds the correlation among these sectors. It is noted that better customer segmentation can increase the ability to identify targeted customers, therefore extracting useful rules for specific clusters can provide an insight into customers' buying behavior and marketing implications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a simple dataset is collected from a financial company in Hong Kong. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can improve the workflow of a financial company, but also deepen understanding of investment behavior. Thus, a corporation is able to customize the most suitable products and services for customers on the basis of the rules extracted.","Association rules mining; Clustering; Customer behavior; Data mining; Financial industry","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A.N., Data mining: A performance perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 5, 6, pp. 914-925, (1993); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G.S., Data mining techniques for marketing, sales, and customer relationship management, (2004); Chiang W.Y., To mine association rules of customer values via a data mining procedure with improved model: An empirical case study, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 3, pp. 1716-1722, (2011); Chung R.C.P., Ip W.H., Chan S.L., An ARIMAIntervention analysis model for the financial crisis in China's manufacturing industry, International Journal of Engineering Business Management, 1, 1, pp. 15-18, (2009); Hosseini S.M.S., Maleki A., Gholamian M.R., Cluster analysis using data mining approach to develop CRM methodology to assess the customer loyalty, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 5259-5264, (2010); Kim J.S., Customized recommendation mechanism based on web data mining and case-based reasoning, Intelligent agents for data mining and information retrieval, (2004); Kirkos E., Spathis C., Manolopoulos Y., Data Mining techniques for the detection of fraudulent financial statements, Expert Systems with Applications, 32, 4, pp. 995-1003, (2007); Kuo R.J., Chao C.M., Chiu Y.T., Application of particle swarm optimization to association rule mining, Applied Soft Computing, 11, 1, pp. 326-336, (2009); Kwan I.S.Y., Fong J., Wong H.K., An ecustomer behavior model with online analytical mining for internet marketing planning, Decision Support Systems, 41, 1, pp. 189-204, (2005); Li Y., Cai H.J., Tan H., Frequent patterns of investment behaviors in Shanghai stock market, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2008); Liang D., Christos T., Experiences of using a quantitative approach for mining association rules, Lecture Notes Computer Science, 2690, pp. 693-700, (2003); Liao S.H., Chen C.M., Wu C.H., Mining customer knowledge for product line and brand extension in retailing, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 3, pp. 1763-1776, (2008); Nanda S.R., Mahanty B., Tiwari M.K., Clustering Indian stock market data for portfolio management, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 12, pp. 8793-8798, (2010); Nenad J., Svetlozar N., Comprehensive data warehouse exploration with qualified association-rule mining, Decision Support Systems, 42, 2, pp. 859-878, (2006); Ngai E.W.T., Xiu L., Chau D.C.K., Application of data mining techniques in customer relationship management: A literature review and classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2, pp. 2592-2602, (2009); Shmueli G., Patel N.R., Bruce P.C., Data mining for business intelligence: concepts, techniques and applications, (2007); Sohn Y.S., Kim Y., Searching customer patterns of mobile service using clustering and quantitative association rule, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 1070-1077, (2008); Sung H.N., So Y.S., Forecasting changes in Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) using association rules, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 7, pp. 9046-9049, (2011); Ting S.L., Shum C.C., Kwok S.K., Tsang A.H.C., Lee W.B., Data mining in biomedicine: Current applications and further directions for research, Journal of Software Engineering & Applications, 2, 3, pp. 150-159, (2009); Vazirgiannis M., Halkidi M., Gunopulos D., Uncertainty handling and quality assessment in data mining, (2003); Wu X.D., Kumar V., Quinlan J.R., Ghosh J., Yang Q., Motoda H., McLachlan G.J., Ng A., Liu B., Yu P.S., Zhou Z., Steinbach M., Hand D.J., Steinberg D., Top 10 algorithms in data mining, Knowledge and Information Systems, 14, 1, pp. 1-37, (2008); Zhang D., Zhou L., Discovering golden nuggests: Data mining in financial application, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part C, Applications and Reviews, 34, 4, pp. 513-522, (2004)","G.T.S.

In addition to exploring the technological issues that arise from the use of these applications, we address some of the social concerns that are too often ignored. As more firms shift more of their business activities to the Web, increasingly more information about consumers and potential customers is being captured in Web server logs. Sophisticated analytic and data mining software tools enable firms to use the data contained in these logs to develop and implement a complex relationship management strategy. Although this new trend in marketing strategy is based on the old idea of relating to customers as individuals, customer relationship management actually rests on segmenting consumers into groups based on profiles developed through a firm's data mining activities. Individuals whose profiles suggest that they are likely to provide a high lifetime value to the firm are served content that will vary from that which is served to consumers with less attractive profiles. Social costs may be imposed on society when objectively rational business decisions involving data mining and consumer profiles are made. The ensuing discussion examines the ways in which data mining and the use of consumer profiles may exclude classes of consumers from full participation in the marketplace, and may limit their access to information essential to their full participation as citizens in the public sphere. We suggest more ethically sensitive alternatives to the unfettered use of data mining.","Analytics; Customer relationship management; Data mining; Marketing discrimination; Personalization; Price discrimination; Privacy; Profiles; Public sphere","","","","","","","","Baker C.E., Advertising and a Democratic Press, (1994); Baker C.E., Media, Markets, and Democracy, (2002); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G., Mastering Data Mining, (2000); Berry M., The privacy backlash, Intelligent Enterprise, OCTOBER 26, (1999); Cohen J.E., Copyright and the perfect curve, Vanderbilt Law Review, 56, 6, pp. 1799-1819, (2000); Customizing Web Information Delivery for Diverse Audiences, (2001); Fink J., Kobsa A., A review and analysis of commercial user modeling servers for personalization on the world wide web, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 10, pp. 209-249, (2000); Gandy O., Dividing practices: Segmentation and targeting in the emerging public sphere, Mediated Politics: Communication in the Future of Democracy, pp. 141-159, (2001); Gerstein J., Online Secrets.

However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results; (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers; and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Online review; Review mining; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Social network","Data mining; Electronic commerce; Experiments; Independent component analysis; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Classification performance; Classification results; Marketing strategy; Online product reviews; Online reviews; Potential customers; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Online systems","","","","","National Key Technology RD Program, (2012BAH16F02); Southwest University of Finance and Economics; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61003254, 91218301); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported in part by the National Key Technology RD Program (No. 2012BAH16F02 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61003254 and 91218301 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , as well as Financial Service Innovation Team Development Project at Southwest University of Finance and Economics (2012) .

While CRM nirvana is the attainment of profitable one-to-one relationships, current activity is concentrated on segmentation. As technology has moved segmentation from simple classification towards more complex predictive modelling, the use of CRM analytic suites comprising statistical techniques such as decision trees, neural networks and cluster analysis is increasing. It is suggested that the subjective nature of cluster analysis may be overlooked when the technique is integrated with other 'tools' into a data-mining package and, consequently, that inadequately tested cluster analysis solutions may be contributing to CRM dissatisfaction. This paper reports the findings of a study which subjected a data set designed for segmentation purposes to a series of rigorous validity and reliability tests and went as far as to randomise the data to ascertain whether current methods could detect 'false' data. The study shows, alarmingly, that under certain conditions random data can 'pass' standard tests and highlights just how meticulously and thoroughly cluster analysis solutions must be tested before they can be safely used in formulating marketing strategy. Practical, theoretical and technical advice is offered for managers working with CRM analytics suites and avenues suggested for future research into improved CRM performance through effective management of the IT/marketing interface.","","","","","","","","","Aldenderfer M.S., Blashfield R.K., Cluster Analysis, (1984); Bird D., Common Sense Direct Marketing, (2000); Broadbent M., Crick T., Market research and database marketing - Exploiting overlaps to add value to the business, The Marriage of Market Research and Database Marketing Conference, (1999); Brown S., Postmodern Marketing, (1995); Brown S., Post Modern Marketing Two: Telling Tales, (1998); Brown S., The Route to Strategic Customer Care, (1999); Chaturvedi A., Carroll J.D., Green P.E., Rotondo J.A., A feature-based approach to market segmentation via overlapping K-centroids clustering, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 370-377, (1997); Cova B., Community and consumption: Towards a definition of the 'linking value' of product or services, European Journal of Marketing, 31, 3-4, pp. 297-316, (1997); Dibb S., New millenium, new segments: Moving towards a segment of one?, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 9, 3, pp. 193-213, (2001); Dibb S., Criteria guiding segmentation implementation: Reviewing the evidence, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 7, 2, pp. 107-129, (1999); Dibb S., Simkin L., Market segmentation: Diagnosing and treating the barriers, Industrial Marketing Management, 30, 8, pp. 609-626, (2001); Dibb S., Stern P., Questioning the reliability of market segmentation techniques, Omega, International Journal of Management Science, 23, 6, pp. 625-636, (1995); Durman P., Goodbye yuppies: Hello L-plate lads and new traditionalists, The Sunday Times, (2001); Eckerson W., Watson H., Harnessing Customer Information for Strategic Advantage: Technical Challenges and Business Solutions, Industry Study 2000, (2001); Edelstein H., Building profitable customer relationships with data mining, SPSS Executive Briefing, (2002); Everitt B.S., Cluster Analysis, (1993); Firat A.F., Venkatesh A., Postmodernity: The age of marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 10, 2, pp. 227-249, (1993); Firat A.F., Schulz J.

While CRM nirvana is the attainment of profitable one-to-one relationships, current activity is concentrated on segmentation. As technology has moved segmentation from simple classification towards more complex predictive modelling, the use of CRM analytic suites comprising statistical techniques such as decision trees, neural networks and cluster analysis is increasing. It is suggested that the subjective nature of cluster analysis may be overlooked when the technique is integrated with other ‘tools’ into a data-mining package and, consequently, that inadequately tested cluster analysis solutions may be contributing to CRM dissatisfaction. This paper reports the findings of a study which subjected a data set designed for segmentation purposes to a series of rigorous validity and reliability tests and went as far as to randomise the data to ascertain whether current methods could detect ‘false’ data. The study shows, alarmingly, that under certain conditions random data can ‘pass’ standard tests and highlights just how meticulously and thoroughly cluster analysis solutions must be tested before they can be safely used in formulating marketing strategy. Practical, theoretical and technical advice is offered for managers working with CRM analytics suites and avenues suggested for future research into improved CRM performance through effective management of the IT/marketing interface. © 2003 Market Research Society.","","","","","","","","","Aldenderfer M.S., Blashfield R.K., Cluster Analysis, (1984);

Accordingly, improving the quality of a recommendation to fulfill customers' needs is important in fiercely competitive environments. Although various recommender systems have been proposed, few have addressed the lifetime value of a customer to a firm. Generally, customer lifetime value (CLV) is evaluated in terms of recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) variables. However, the relative importance among them varies with the characteristics of the product and industry. We developed a novel product recommendation methodology that combined group decision-making and data mining techniques. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to determine the relative weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. Clustering techniques were then employed to group customers according to the weighted RFM value. Finally, an association rule mining approach was implemented to provide product recommendations to each customer group. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach outperformed one with equally weighted RFM and a typical collaborative filtering (CF) method. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the multi decision tree (MDT) is to improve decision tree classifier. The performances of MDT are compared with C4.5 decision tree algorithm and some ensemble of decision tree classifiers, namely bagging decision tree, boosting decision trees (BDT) and random forests decision tree.

To model consumer responses to direct marketing, this study proposes Bayesian networks learned by evolutionary programming. Using a large direct marketing data set, we tested the endogeneity bias in the recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) variables using the control function approach; compared the results of Bayesian networks with those of neural networks, classification and regression tree (CART), and latent class regression; and applied a tenfold cross-validation. The results suggest that Bayesian networks have distinct advantages over the other methods in accuracy of prediction, transparency of procedures, interpretability of results, and explanatory insight. Our findings lend strong support to Bayesian networks as a robust tool for modeling consumer response and other marketing problems and for assisting management decision making. © 2006 INFORMS.","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Direct marketing; Evolutionary programming; Machine learning","Behavioral research; Computer programming; Data mining; Database systems; Learning systems; Management; Marketing; Networks (circuits); Tools; Bayesian networks; Direct marketing; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Leone R.P., Jen L., A dynamic model of purchase timing with application to direct marketing, J.

A major shift occurs in the marketing efforts. Given the abundant information on customers and products, marketing responsibility has changed from managing products for sellers to managing relationships with customers, and to facilitating decision-making for customers. These marketing efforts are essentially an intermediary of two-way communication between businesses and customers, and they would require data analysis techniques. Particularly through data mining, which comprises techniques for the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, organisations are able to identify valuable customers, predict future behaviours, and allow firms to make proactive, knowledge driven decisions. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each method having its advantages and disadvantages for different types of marketing purposes. This paper examines the issue of applying different techniques to meet the marketing requirements in the network economy. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). Two case studies are provided to illustrate how different data mining techniques can be utilised to accomplish various marketing efforts.

Data aggregation is a common operation in business, science, engineering, medicine, etc.; it is performed for purposes such as statistical, financial, and sales and marketing analysis - particularly within the context of a data warehouse. We showed experimentally that, for this example, as long as aggregation does not shrink the sample size unduly, it does not significantly impair the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting the direction of the DJIA stock market index. We also observed that aggregation-based models are simpler (less over-parameterized) than detail-based models. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the robustness of such predictive models. Specifically, we used the area under the ROC curve as a summary measure of the overall performance of a given model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To assess data mining for use by political marketers, we mined the 1948 to 2004 American National Elections Studies data file to identify a small number of variables and rules that can be used to predict individual voting behavior, including abstention, with the intent of segmenting the electorate in useful and meaningful ways. The resulting decision tree correctly predicts vote choice with 66 percent accuracy, a success rate that compares favorably with other predictive methods. More importantly, the process provides rules that identify segments of voters based on their predicted vote choice, with the vote choice of some segments predictable with up to 87 percent success. These results suggest that the data mining methodology may increase efficiency for political campaigns, but they also suggest that, from a democratic theory perspective, overall participation may be improved by communicating more effective messages that better inform intended voters and that motivate individuals to vote who otherwise may abstain. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Campaign strategy; Classification; Data mining; Domain expert; Domain knowledge; Microtargeting; Political marketing; Vote choice; Voting behavior","","","","","","","","Abramson P.R., Aldrigh J.H., Rohde D.W., Change and Coninuity In 2000 and 2002 Elections, (2003); Alvarez R.M., Nagler J., Economics, issues and the Perot candidacy: Voter choice in the 1992 presidential election, American Journal of Political Science, 39, 3, pp. 714-744, (1995); Amercan National Election Studies Cumulative Data File: 1948-2004, (2005); Anand S.S., Bell D.A., Hughes J.G., The role of domain knowledge in data mining, Proceedings of The Fourth International Conference On Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 37-43, (1995); Andoh-Baidoo F.K., Osei-Bryson K.-M., Exploring the characteristics of Internet security breaches that impact the market value of breached firms, Expert Systems With Applications, 32, 3, pp. 703-725, (2007); Ankerst M., Ester M., Kriegel H.-P., Towards an effective cooperation of the user and the computer for classification, Proceedings of The Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference On Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 179-188, (2000); Burton M.J., Shea D.M., Campaign Mode: Strategic Vision In Congressional Elections, (2003); Edsall T.B., Democrats' data mining stirs an intraparty battle, The Washington Post, (2006); Fiorina M.P., Retrospective Voting In American National Elections, (1981); Fridkin K.L., Kenney P.J., Do negative messages work?

Where applications to HE are administered through centralised admission services, applicants will often make multiple initial course choices, which offers an opportunity to examine systematic groupings of interest within course choice sets, and assess whether certain types of student are more likely to make concentrated or diffuse subject selections. Utilising a national database of an entire cohort's application behaviour, the empirical findings presented in this article indicate that there are clusters of subjects that are applied for in combination, and that certain ethnic minority, socio-economic groups and neighbourhood types are more likely to make more diffuse subject choices. This creates an information base of generalised course choice behaviours that HE institutions could utilise for targeted marketing, recruitment and selection activities, and additionally forms the basis of a decision support framework that could be implemented in a variety of online tools to help guide student courses. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","Data mining, marketing; Geodemographics; GIS; Higher education","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/G001464/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","","Drummond G., Consumer confusion: Reduction strategies in higher education., International Journal of Educational Management, 18, 5, pp. 317-323, (2004); Litten L.H., Market structure and institutional position in geographic market segments., Research in Higher Education, 11, 1, pp. 59-83, (1979); Litten L.H., Marketing higher education: Benefi ts and risks for the American academic system., The Journal of Higher Education, 51, 1, pp. 40-59, (1980); Bok D., Universities in the Marketplace, (2003); Hill F., Managing service quality in higher education: The role of the student as primary consumer., Quality Assurance in Higher Education, 3, 3, pp. 10-21, (1995); Maringe F., Gibbs P., Marketing Higher Education., (2008); Tonks D., Farr M., Market segments for higher education: Using geodemographics, Market Inteligence & Planning, 13, 4, pp. 24-33, (1995); Borden V., Segmenting student markets with a student satisfaction and priorities survey., Research in Higher Education, 36, 1, pp. 73-88, (1995); Singleton A., Longley P., Creating Open Source Geodemographics-Refining A National Classification of Census Output Areas for Applications in Higher Education, (2009); Rindfleish J.M., Segment profiling: Reducing strategic risk in higher education management, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 25, 2, pp. 147-159, (2003); Rogers G., Finley D., Kline T., Understanding individual differences in university undergraduates: A needs segmentation approach., Innovative Higher Education, 25, 3, pp. 183-196, (2001); Statistics on HE Applicants and Acceptances Can Be Found Using the UCAS Statistical Enquiry Tool; Foskett N.H., Hemsley-Brown J.V., Choosing Futures-Young People's Decision Making in Education, (2001); Purcell K., Elias P., Ellison R., Atfield G., Adam D., Livanos I., Applying for Higher Education-the Diversity of Career Choices, Plans and Expectations: Findings from the First Futuretrack Survey of The' Class of 2006' Applicants for Higher Education, (2008); Dearing R., National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, (1997); Halsey A.H., Heath A.F., Ridge J.M., Origins and Destinations: Family, Class and Education in Modern Britain, (1980); Paterson L., Trends in higher education participation in Scotland., Higher Education Quarterly, 51, pp. 29-48, (1997); Rudd E., The educational qualifi cations and social class of the parents of undergraduates entering British Universities in 1984., Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules for personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique for personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.","Decision-tree induction; Internet advertising; Internet store-front; Machine learning; Personalization","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Arning A., Bollinger T., Mehta M., Schafer J., Srikant R., The quest data mining system, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining, pp. 244-249, (1996); Allen C., Kania D., Yaeckel B., Internet World Guide to One-to-One Web Marketing, (1998); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G., Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support; Broadvision.

Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely researched. To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer knowledge management for innovative product development. In the knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract customer knowledge from different market segments. An empirical study applying the E-CKM model has been carried out, and it meets the evaluation criteria in a multiple-assessment scheme for showing a satisfactory result. The result is used in the decision making for innovative product development in order to reduce project risk and secure commercial success. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

No matter in what shape or form HOQ can be built, the key to this process is to find out the hidden relationship between customers' requirements and product design specifications. This paper presents a general rough set based data mining approach for HOQ analysis. It utilises the historical information of customer needs and the design specifications of the product that was purchased, employs the basic rough set notions to reveal the interrelationships between customer needs and design specifications automatically. Due to the data reduction nature of the approach, a minimal set of customer needs that are crucial for the decision on the correlated design specifications is derived. The end result of the approach is in the form of a minimal rule set, which not only fulfils the goal of HOQ, but can be used as supporting data for marketing purposes. A case study on the product of electrically powered bicycles is included to illustrate the approach and its efficiency. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Data mining; House of quality; Rough set","Data mining; Data reduction; Houses; Phase interfaces; Product development; Quality control; Quality function deployment; Rough set theory; Sales; Customer need; Design specification; Historical information; House of Quality; Product development teams; Quality product; Rough set; Rough-set based; Rule set; Set of customers; Product design","","","","","","","Byrne J.G., Barlow T., Structured brainstorming: A method for collecting user requirements, Proceedings of the 37th Annual Meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, pp. 427-431, (1993); Chen C.-H., Khoo L.P., Yan W., PDCS - A product definition and customisation system for product concept development, Expert Systems with Applications, 28, 3, pp. 591-602, (2005); Feng C.-X., Kroll D.E., Li P.-G., Fuzzy mapping of functions onto features in detail design, International Journal of Production Research, 38, 10, pp. 2253-2272, (2000); Feng C.-X., Li P.-G., Liang M., Fuzzy mapping of requirements onto functions in detail design, Computer-aided Design, 33, 6, pp. 425-437, (2001); Fung R.Y.K., Popplewell K., Xie J., An intelligent hybrid system for customer requirements analysis and product attribute targets determination, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 1, pp. 13-34, (1998); Griffin G., Chen Z., Rough set extension of Tcl for data mining, Knowledge-Based Systems, 11, 3, pp. 249-253, (1998); Jariri F., Zegordi S.H., Quality function deployment planning for platform design, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 36, 5-6, pp. 419-430, (2008); Jiao J.R., Zhang Y., Product portfolio identification based on association rule mining, Computer-Aided Design, 37, 2, pp. 149-172, (2005); Jiao J.R., Chen C.H., Customer requirement management in product development: A review on research issues, Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applciations, 14, 3, pp. 173-185, (2006); Jiao J.R., Et al., Association rule mining for product and process variety mapping, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 21, 1, pp. 111-124, (2008); Khoo L.P., Tor S.B., Li J.R., A rough set approach to the ordering of basic events in a fault tree for fault diagnosis, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 17, 10, pp. 769-774, (2001); Kusiak A., Computational Intelligence in Design and Manufacturing, (2000); Kusiak A., Rough set theory: A data mining tool for semiconductor manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing, 24, 1, pp. 44-50, (2001); Li J.R., Khoo L.P., Tor S.B., RMINE: A rough set based data mining prototype for the reasoning of incomplete data in condition-based fault diagnosis, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 17, 1, pp. 163-176, (2006); Mousavi A., Et al., Customer optimization route and evaluation (CORE) for product design, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 14, 2, pp. 236-243, (2001); Pawlak Z., Rough sets, International Journal of Information and Computer Science, 11, 5, pp. 348-356, (1982); Pawlak Z., Rough Set: Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Data, (1991); Pawlak Z., Hard and soft sets, Rough Sets and Fuzzy Set and Knowledge Discovery - Proceedings of the International Workshop on Rough Sets and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 130-135, (1994); Raharjo H., Brombacher A.C., Xie M., Dealing with subjectivity in early product design phase: A systematic approach to exploit quality function deployment potentials, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 55, 1, pp. 253-278, (2008); Shahin A., Quality Function Deployment: A Comprehensive Review, (2003); Shao X.Y., Et al., Integrating data mining and rough set for customer group-based discovery of product configuration rules, International Journal of Production Research, 44, 14, pp. 2789-2811, (2006); Temponi C., Yen J., Tiao W.A., House of quality: A fuzzy logic-based requirements analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 117, 2, pp. 340-354, (1999); Tsumoto S., Knowledge discovery in medical databases based on rough sets and attributeoriented generalisation, Proceedings of IEEE World Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2, pp. 1296-1301, (1998); Xia S.S., Wang L.Y., Customer requirements mapping method based on association rule mining for mass customization, Journal of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Science), 13 E, 3, pp. 291-296, (2008); Zhai L.Y., Khoo L.P., Zhong Z.W., A rough set enhanced fuzzy approach to quality function deployment, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 37, 5-6, pp. 613-624, (2008)","J.

The decision to pay these dividends to shareholders concerns several other groups of people, such as financial managers, consulting firms, individual and institutional investors, government and monitoring authorities, and creditors, just to name a few. The prediction and modelling of this decision has received a significant amount of attention in the corporate finance literature. However, the methods used to study the aforementioned question are limited to the logistic regression method without any implementation of the advanced and expert methods of data mining. These methods have proven their superiority in other business-related fields, such as marketing, production, accounting and auditing. In finance, bankruptcy prediction has the vast majority among data-mining implementations, but to the best of the authors’ knowledge such an implementation does not exist in dividend payment prediction. This paper satisfies this gap in the literature and provides answers that help to understand the so-called ‘dividend puzzle’. Specifically, this paper provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that data-mining methods perform better in accuracy measures against the traditional methods used. The prediction of dividend policy determinants provides valuable benefits to all related parties, as they can manage, invest, consult and monitor the dividend policy in a more effective way.

Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer information; Customer lifetime value;

A data mining process discovers interesting information from the hidden data that can either be used for future prediction and/or intelligently summarising the details of the data. There are many achievements of applying data mining techniques to various areas such as marketing, medical, decision support, flaw detection, business management and financial, although few of them can be currently seen in virtual reality domain. In this paper, a proposed data mining application in virtual reality is explained and experimented. The empirical results demonstrate the capability of data mining techniques in virtual reality and the potential benefits in applying data mining to this area.

The paper also seeks to establish a KM and aCRM based framework using data mining (DM) techniques, which helps in the enterprise decision-making. The objective is to share how KM and aCRM can be integrated into this seamless analytics framework to sustain excellence in decision making using effective data mining techniques and to explore how working on such aCRM system can be effective for enabling organizations delivering complete solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on focused and dedicated study of the literature present on the aCRM, KM and data mining techniques. The paper considered how to develop a strategy and operational framework that would build aCRM on the foundation of existing DM techniques and KM approach to meet the business challenges. Based on this research, a customized, integrated framework, to match the needs of business was designed. Findings: KM focuses on managing knowledge within the organization and aCRM focuses on gaining analytical information from the customer data. Both KM and aCRM help in the decision making process and understanding. This knowledge is difficult to uncover. Hence, this paper explains the importance of data mining tools and techniques to uncover knowledge by the integration between KM and aCRM. This paper presents an integrated KM and aCRM based framework using DM techniques. Research limitations/implications: All the firms may not be in favor of adopting KM while implementing aCRM. The KM requires a convalesce of organizational culture, technology innovations, effective work force in culminating knowledge dissemination in all business domains. Practical implications: The organizations implementing this knowledge enabled aCRM framework would be easily able to convert their business knowledge via the analytical CRM to solve many business issues, such as increase response rates from direct mail, telephone, e-mail, and internet delivered marketing campaigns, increased sales and increased services. With aCRM, firms can identify their most profitable customers and use this knowledge for promotional schemes for those customers as well as identify future customers with prediction on ROI. Originality/value: The need for the integration of KM and aCRM is clear. It is written for practitioners who are looking for approaches to improve business performance and maintain high profits for their business by incorporating knowledge-enabled aCRM in their setup. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business analysis;

In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice. © 2013 INFORMS.","Brand community; Communication mode; Conometric modeling; Consumer behavior; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content","Commerce; Data mining; Economics; Elasticity; Joining; Marketing; Purchasing; Sales; Social networking (online); Brand community; Communication mode; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content; Consumer behavior","","","","","","","Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer pur-chase behavior, J.

However, exploring associations among items associated with their purchased quantities may discover information useful to improve the quality of business decisions. In this paper, we investigate the issue of mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions. When purchased quantities are considered, the supports of items associated with their purchased quantities may decrease drastically, and the number of potentially interesting association rules discovered will be few. In order to discover more potentially interesting rules, we present two partition algorithms to partition all the possible quantities into intervals for each item. We also propose an efficient mechanism to discover all the large itemsets from the partitioned data. Experimental results show that by our approach, the total execution time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, the potentially interesting rule discovered from the partitioned data can be considered to be a kind of generalized association rule. The generalized association rule is useful in marketing, business management and decision making, especially when the information from the rules generated from the original data is limited.","Data mining; Large q_itemset generation; Partition scheme; Performance study; Quantitative association rule","Algorithms; Database systems; Decision making; Industrial management; Marketing; Sales; Business management; Mining quantitative association rules; Sales transactions; Data mining","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Ghosh S., Imielinski T., Iyer B., Swami A., An interval classifier for database mining applications, Proceedings of the VLDB Conference, 1992, pp. 560-573; Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A., Database mining: A performance perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 5, 6, pp. 914-925, (1993); Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD, 1993, pp. 207-216; Agrawal R., Srikant R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules, Proceedings of the VLDB Conference, 1994, pp. 487-499; Cai Y., Cercone N., Han J., An attribute-oriented approach for learning classification rules for relational databases, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 1990, pp. 281-288; Chen M.S., Han J., Yu P.S., Data mining: An overview from a database perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 8, 6, pp. 866-883, (1996); Fukuda T., Morimoto Y., Morishita S., Tokuyama T., Mining optimized association rules for numeric attributes, Proceedings of the ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, pp. 182-191, (1996); Han J., Cai Y., Cercone N., Knowledge discovery in databases: An attribute-oriented approach, Proceedings of the VLDB Conference, 1992, pp. 547-559; Han J., Fu Y., Discovery of multiple-level association rules from large databases, Proceedings of the VLDB Conference, 1995, pp. 420-431; Hu X., Cercone N., Mining knowledge rules from databases: A rough set approach, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 1996, pp. 96-106; Lent B., Swami A., Widom J., Clustering association rules, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 1997, pp. 220-231; Park J.S., Chen M.S., Yu P.S., Using a hash-based method with transaction trimming for mining association rules, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 9, 5, pp. 813-825, (1997); Rastogi R., Shim K., Mining optimized association rules with categorical and numeric attributes, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 1998, pp. 503-512; Savasere A., Omiecinski E., Navathe S., An efficient algorithm for mining association rules in large databases, Proceedings of the VLDB Conference, 1995, pp. 432-444; Srikant R., Agrawal R., Mining generalized association rules, Proceedings of the VLDB Conference, 1995, pp. 407-419; Srikant R., Agrawal R., Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD, 1996, pp. 1-12","C.-M.

Telephone call detail records provide a novel way to understand the strength of the relationship between individuals. In this paper, we predict using call detail records the impact that the behavior of one customer has on another customer's decisions. We study this in the context of churn (a decision to leave a communication service provider) and cross-buying decisions based on an anonymized data set from a telecommunications provider. Call detail records are represented as a weighted graph and a novel statistical learning technique, Markov logic networks, is used in conjunction with logit models based on lagged neighborhood variables to develop the predictive model. In addition, we propose an approach to propositionalization tailored to predictive modeling with social network data. The results show that information on the churn of network neighbors has a significant positive impact on the predictive accuracy and in particular the sensitivity of churn models.

Thus, although correct models are estimated, students often do not obtain a thorough understanding of the nonlinear estimation process. The exercise presented in this article was created to demonstrate to students the need for nonlinear regression estimation-rather than using linear transformations and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and subsequently demonstrate the nonlinear optimization process to estimate nonlinear regression models. Using the spreadsheet exercise, students can see effects on the fit of the model by changing the model parameters as they change the values of the decision variables. After applying the spreadsheet to further exercises, students have expressed a deep understanding of the linear regression software. This exercise is innovative because the active learning exercise requires the students to make the logical connections between the structure of the model, the model's parameters, and the objective function. © 2013 The Author Decision Sciences © 2013 Decision Sciences Institute.","Analytics; And Regression; Nonlinear; Optimization","","","","","","","","Albritton M.D., McMullen P.R., Classroom integration of statistics and management science via forecasting, Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 4, 2, pp. 331-336, (2006); Bonwell C.C., Eison J.A., Active learning: Creating excitement in the classroom, ASHE-ERIC Higher education report no. 1, (1991); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Competing on analytics, the new science of winning, (2007); Dielbold F.X., Elements of forecasting (4th ed.), (2008); Evans J.R., Business analytics; methods, models, and decisions, (2013); Fisher M.L., Raman A., The new science of retailing, how analytics are transforming the supply chain and improving performance, (2010); Hosmer D.W., Lemeshow S., Applied logistic regression (2nd ed.), (2000); Prince M., Does active learning work?

These systems can automatically capture data on the browsing histories and purchasing records of individual customers. This capability has motivated the development of data-mining applications. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a useful data-mining method to discover customers' purchasing patterns over time. We incorporate the recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) concept presented in the marketing literature to define the RFM sequential pattern and develop a novel algorithm for generating all RFM sequential patterns from customers' purchasing data. Using the algorithm, we propose a pattern segmentation framework to generate valuable information on customer purchasing behavior for managerial decision-making. Extensive experiments are carried out, using synthetic datasets and a transactional dataset collected by a retail chain in Taiwan, to evaluate the proposed algorithm and empirically demonstrate the benefits of using RFM sequential patterns in analyzing customers' purchasing data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Social network analysis provides a powerful set of tools for modelling social networks to understand their structure and behaviour. However, current challenge is that the target environments involve large amounts of relational data that characterise multi-entities, time-sensitive, decision-making situations. To understand the structure and the dynamic mechanisms of the complex real-world system, the researchers need innovative network modelling approaches and analysis techniques. This paper first proposes a social buying metanetwork model, and then provides a methodology framework integrated business intelligence techniques with dynamic network analysis tools, finally the case study describes the process on metanetwork modelling, dynamic network analysis, and buyer behaviour pattern mining.

The WOE approach allows analysts to identify and transform the variables with the most predictive power regarding the likelihood of tourists' online preferences and decisions. The study found that just over one-third of the respondents browsed hotel-related websites, and about half of those browsers had booked a room on those sites. Browsers in Hong Kong tended to be young, well educated, and well traveled. Those who used the hotel websites for purchases were, of course, part of the browser group, and were likewise relatively well educated. However, one unexpected variable set off those who used the websites for a hotel purchase, the length of their most recent trip. One possible reason is that long-haul tourists want to be sure of their accommodations, or this may reflect hotels' free-night offers. The convenient use of model-based customer segmentation and decision rules would help hospitality practitioners effectively manage their marketing resources and activities, and enhance information-based marketing strategies to attract target customers. © The Author(s) 2013.","data mining; hotel website; information technology; prediction; travel behavior; weight of evidence","","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (10YJCZH174); Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to acknowledge the funding supports from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Sun Yat-sen University, and the Social Science Youth Fund of Ministry of Education (Grant 10YJCZH174).","Amemiya T., Advanced Econometrics, (1985); Domestic households by monthly domestic household income, (2006); Population and vital events, (2008); Cybenko G., Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function, Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, 2, 4, pp. 303-314, (1989); Good I.J., Probability and Weighting of Evidence, (1950); Good I.J., Osteyee D.B., Information, Weight of Evidence: The Singularity between Probability Measures and Signal Detection, (1974); Gronflaten O., Predicting travelers' choice of information sources and information channels, Journal of Travel Research, 48, 2, pp. 230-244, (2009); Distribution of educational attainment of population aged 15 and over, (2008); Kim J., Wei S., Ruys H., Segmenting the market of West Australian senior tourists using an artificial neural network, Tourism Management, 24, 1, pp. 25-34, (2003); Kim W.G., Kim D.J., Factors affecting online hotel reservation intention between online and non-online customers, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 23, 4, pp. 381-395, (2004); Law R., Hsu C., Importance of hotel website dimensions and attributes: Perceptions of online browsers and online purchasers, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 30, 3, pp. 295-312, (2006); Massey F.J., The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for goodness of fit, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 46, 253, pp. 68-78, (1951); McCall M., Voorhees C., The drivers of loyalty program success: An organizing framework and research agenda, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 51, 1, pp. 35-52, (2010); Morosan C., Jeong M., Users' perceptions of two types of hotel reservation web sites, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 27, 2, pp. 284-292, (2008); Murphy J., Bennett M., Hofacker C.F., Website-generated market-research data: Tracing and tracks left behind by visitors, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 82-91, (2001); O'Connor P., E-mail marketing by international hotel chains: An industry-practices update, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 49, 1, pp. 42-52, (2008); O'Connor P., Frew A.J., The future of hotel electronic distribution: Expert and industry perspectives, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 43, 3, pp. 33-45, (2002); O'Connor P., Piccoli G., Global distribution systems: Revisited, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 44, 5-6, pp. 105-114, (2003); Olsen M.D., Connolly D.J., Experience-based travel: How technology is changing the hospitality industry, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 41, 1, pp. 30-40, (2000); Toh R.S., DeKay F., Raven P., Travel planning: Searching for and booking hotels on the internet, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 52, 4, pp. 388-398, (2011); Toh R.S., Raven P., DeKay F., Selling rooms: Hotels vs. third-party websites, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 52, 2, pp. 181-189, (2011); Verma R., Customer choice modeling in hospitality services: A review of past research and discussion of some new applications, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 51, 4, pp. 470-478, (2010); Vina L., Ford J., Logistic regression analysis of cruise vacation market potential: Demographic and trip attribute perception factors, Journal of Travel Research, 39, pp. 406-410, (2001); Weed D.L., Weight of evidence: A review of concept and methods, Risk Analysis, 25, 6, pp. 1545-1557, (2005); Wen I., Factors affecting the online travel buying decision: A review, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 21, 6, pp. 752-765, (2009); Wong J., Law R., Analysing the intention to purchase on hotel websites: A study of travellers to Hong Kong, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 24, 3, pp. 311-329, (2005)","E.

Variants of RFM are demonstrated. Classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks are also demonstrated. Results indicate a spectrum of tradeoffs. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. Considerations of balancing cell sizes as well as compressing data are examined. Both balancing expected cell densities as well as compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide more accurate models. Data mining algorithms were all found to provide a noticeable increase in predictive accuracy. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Customer segmentation; Decision tree models; Logistic regression; Neural networks; RFM","","","","","","","","Baesens B., Viaene S., van den Poel D., Vanthienen J., Dedene G., Bayesian neural network learning for repeat purchase modeling in direct marketing, Eur J Oper Res, 138, 1, pp. 191-211, (2002); Bult J.R., Wanskeek T., Optimal selection for direct mail, J Market Sci, 14, 4, pp. 378-394, (1995); Crone S.F., Lessmann S., Stahlbock R., The impact of preprocessing on data mining: An evaluation of classifier sensitivity in direct marketing, Eur J Oper Res, 173, 3, pp. 781-800, (2006); Cui G., Wong M.L., Lui H.-K., Machine learning for direct marketing response models: Bayesian networks with evolutionary programming, Manag Sci, 52, 4, pp. 597-612, (2006); D'souza R., Krasnodebski M., Abrahams A., Implementation study: Using decision tree induction to discover profitable locations to sell pet insurance for a startup company, J Database Market Custom Strategy Manag, 14, 4, pp. 281-288, (2007); Elsner R., Krafft M., Huchzemeier A., Optimizing Rhenania's mail-order business through dynamic multilevel modeling (DMLM), Interfaces, 33, 1, pp. 50-66, (2003); Fitzpatrick M., Statistical analysis for direct marketers-in plain English, Direct Market, 64, 4, pp. 54-56, (2001); Hoya T., On the capability of accommodating new classes within probabilistic neural networks, IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 14, 2, pp. 450-453, (2003); Jin X., Srinivasan D., Cheu R.L., Classification of freeway traffic patterns for incident detection using constructive probabilistic neural networks, IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 12, 5, pp. 1173-1187, (2001); Koonce D.A., Fang C.-H., Tsai S.-C., A data mining tool for learning from manufacturing systems, Comput Ind Eng, 33, 1-2, pp. 27-30, (1997); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Integrating AHP and data mining for product recommendation based on customer lifetime value, Inf Manag, 42, 3, pp. 387-400, (2005); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Hybrid approaches to product recommendation based on customer lifetime value and purchase preferences, J Syst Softw, 77, 2, pp. 181-191, (2005); Lo V.S.Y., The true lift model-a novel data mining approach to response modeling in database marketing, ACM SIGKDD, 4, 2, pp. 78-86, (2003); McCarty J.A., Hastak M., Segmentation approaches in data-mining: A comparison of RFM, CHAID, and logistic regression, J Bus Res, 60, 6, pp. 656-662, (2007); Miglautsch J., Application of RFM principles: What to do with 1-1-1 customers?, J Database Market, 9, 4, pp. 319-324, (2002); Olson D.L., Shih Y., Introduction to Business Data Mining, (2007); Shih Y.-Y., Liu C.-Y., A method for customer lifetime value ranking-combining the analytic hierarchy process and clustering analysis, Database Market Custom Strategy Manag, 11, 2, pp. 159-172, (2003); Specht D.F., Probabilistic neural networks, Neural Netw, 3, pp. 110-118, (1990); van den Berg B., Breur T., Merits of interactive decision tree building: Part 1, J Target Measur Anal Market, 15, 3, pp. 137-145, (2007); van den Berg B., Breur T., Merits of interactive decision tree building: Part 2: How to do it, J Target Measur Anal Market, 15, 4, pp. 201-209, (2007); Verhoef P.C., Spring P.N., Hoekstra J.C., Leeflang P.S.H., The commercial use of segmentation and predictive modeling techniques for database marketing in the Netherlands, Decis Support Syst, 34, 4, pp. 471-481, (2003); Weng S.S., Chiu R.-K., Wang B.-J., Su S.-H., The study and verification of a mathematical modeling for customer purchasing behavior, J Comput Inf Syst, 47, 2, pp. 46-57, (2006); Yang A.X., How to develop new approaches to RFM segmentation, J Target Measur Anal Market, 13, 1, pp. 50-60, (2004); Yun H., Ha D., Hwang B., Ryu K.H., Mining association rules on significant rare data using relative support, J Syst Softw, 67, pp. 181-191, (2003)","D.

Accordingly, this paper aims to present a new way for gauging customer loyalty and predicting their possibility of defection reference to a set of quality attributes satisfaction and three types of belief in the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/ approach - The performance of the classification utilization artificial neural networks (ANNs) was compared to that of traditional analytic tools, such as multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and classificatory data mining technique - decision tree. Findings - The analytical result represented that the predicted accuracy of ANNs is better then MDA and decision tree in both training and testing phases. Degree of repurchase intention has been classified correctly with a success rate of 83 percent using neural networks. Research limitations/implications - Like all research, this study has its limitations. One such limitation is that the predictive model was designed for application to online bookstores. A further limitation of this survey is that it reflects intentions instead of actual behavior. Finally, despite of ANNs has been applied to numerous areas and have demonstrated a degree of classification success, it is difficult to extract rules for explanation. Therefore, enhancing ability of model explanation would be a valuable work in the future. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is to predict how marketing practitioners can tactically market to customers with weak repurchase intentions to prevent defections. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer satisfaction;

This allows segments of customers to be drawn according to selected relevant demographic variables. This is referred to as Database Marketing, a new trend in marketing that makes use of information available in a company's database. The extracted information is also useful in planning marketing strategies, launching new products/services and defining market segmentation.As databases in large corporations nowadays are getting large, sparser, more free-formatted and more dynamic, traditional statistical techniques may not be capable of extracting the encapsulated knowledge inside the databases. A new technical stream, data mining has been developed in Computer Science to deal with the complex task of extracting and managing any potential knowledge embedded inside databases. This paper introduces the common techniques in data mining, including decision tree classifiers, regression analysis, induction programming logic, and probabilistic rules. Suggestions are offered about how these techniques can be used in order to improve the engineering behind Database Marketing, which can help to promote niche markets in tourism. By utilizing its know-how in Database Marketing, a company can sharpen its competitiveness and build entry barriers for others. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

These decisions are two focal points of all companies which many strategies are followed or influenced by them. Decision making is based on information and data mining aims to extract useful information form implicit, unknown and raw data. Clustering techniques are one of the widely used data mining tools which have been used for dividing market into different segments. In recent years, numerous papers about using data mining or multi attribute decision making (MADM) for marketing decisions have been published. MADM tools are used as a natural approach for evaluating alternatives with respect to conflict criterion. Thus, this study aims to integrate these two fields for improving quality of market segmentation's decisions. The proposed methodology is a combination of data mining tools for market segmentation and MA DM tools for evaluation and selection of the best market. More precisely, clustering is used to divide a whole market into different segments. Two MA DM tools including, step-wise weight assessment ratio Analysis (SIVARA) and complex proportional assessment of alternatives with grey relations (COPRAS-G), were applied for market segment evaluation and selection. The most desirable features influencing the choice of a market segment evaluation and selection are identified based on literature study. Grey relation analysis allows incorporating the vague and imprecise information in to the decision model. A real-world data on a laptop market is put forward to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The proposed model could help companies to segment, evaluate and select the best market.","Clustering; COPRAS-G; Data mining; MADM; Market segment evaluation and selection; Market segmentation; SWARA","","","","","","","","Aghdaie M.H., Hashemkhani Zolfani S., Zavadskas E.K., Decision making in machine tool selection: An integrated approach with SWARA and COPRAS-G methods, Inzinerine Ekonomika - Engineering Economics, 24, 1, pp. 5-17, (2013);

Actors in different enterprises worked feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital data will give objective insight into human relations and provide authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of communication and social shaping of database and data mining technologies in the institutional context of genome science to understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with biological, physical, and big data. We found a rise in the use of racial discourse that suggests race has a genetic foundation. © 2013 (Peter A. Chow-White & Sandy E.

Although prior research efforts have attempted to investigate the behavior of users regarding the sharing of personal experiences and browsing the experiences of others online, it remains a challenge for business managers to incorporate eWOM effects into their business planning and decision-making processes effectively. Applying a newly proposed association rule mining technique, this study investigates eWOM in the context of the tourism industry using an outbound domestic tourism data set that was recently collected in Hong Kong. The complete profiles and the relations of online experience sharers and travel website browsers are explored.

Because the data mining process is a relatively new concept, it has been defined in various ways by various authors in the recent past. Data mining allows managers to make more knowledgeable decisions by predicting future trends and behaviours. One of the most widely used areas of data mining for the retail industry is in marketing. Market basket analysis is a marketing method used by many retailers to determine the optimal locations to promote products. The market basket is defined as an item set bought together by a customer on a single visit to a store. The market basket analysis is a powerful tool for the implementation of cross-selling strategies. This article has defined market basket analysis as a data mining tool used to extract important information from existing data and enable better decision making throughout an organisation. This article specifically focuses on the application of market basket analysis a data mining tool in Indian retail industries.

Each institution type has developed its own marketing strategy along with relationship management strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Real transaction data from 88 pharmaceutical companies were the study samples. Expert interviews were conducted to analyze industry knowledge. The frequency, money, and contract term (FMC) model was developed to assess and segment the healthcare institutions. ANOVA and the Scheffe post-test were used to explore the test effects of each FMC indicator among the groups. The C5.0 decision tree was then used to generate the behavioral rules of various segmentations. Finally, this study combined the related variables with the purchasing behavioral rules to propose specific strategies for each type of healthcare institution. Findings - A total of 663 health care institutions in Taiwan were divided into four types: loyalist, intellectualist, nitpicking, and churn. The terms frequency (F), money (M) and contract term (C) were all significant indicators for determining the differences among the four customer categories at the 0.01 level of significance. The behavioral rules related to the four categories were determined by using the C5.0 algorithm. Originality/value - This FMC model can provide a strategic development method for the pharmaceutical industry to conduct market segmentation. The findings may assist pharmaceutical companies provide customized services to health care institutions and to manage their downstream demand effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer value; Data mining; Decision tree; Pharmaceutical marketing","Commerce; Data mining; Decision trees; Health care; Industry; Societies and institutions; Customer value assessments; Customer values; Design/methodology/approach; Healthcare institutions; Pharmaceutical company; Pharmaceutical industry; Pharmaceutical marketing; Relationship management; Sales","","","","","","","Ali S., Smith K.A., On learning algorithm selection for classification, Applied Soft Computing, 6, 2, pp. 119-138, (2006); Alt R., Osterle H., Puschmann T., Barak V., Huber T., Customer relationship management architecture in the pharmaceutical industry, International Journal of Healthcare Technology and Management, 5, 3-5, pp. 296-314, (2003); Baram-Tsabari A., Segev E., Exploring new web-based tools to identify public interest in science, Public Understanding of Science, 21, 1, pp. 130-143, (2011); Bellazzi R., Zupan B., Predictive data mining in clinical medicine: Current issues and guidelines, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 77, 2, pp. 81-97, (2008); Biggs D.B., De Ville B., Suen E., A method of choosing multi-way partitions for classification and decision trees, Journal of Applied Statistics, 18, 1, pp. 49-62, (1991); Breiman L., Friedman J., Olsen R., Stone C., Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Cadez S., Guilding C., Strategy, strategic management accounting and performance: A configurational analysis, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 112, 3, pp. 484-501, (2012); Cheng C.L., Kao Y.H.Y., Lin S.J., Lee C.H., Lai M.L., Validation of the national health insurance research database with ischemic stroke cases in Taiwan, Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, 20, 3, pp. 236-242, (2011); Chu C.L., Chiang T.L., Chang R.E., Hospital competition and inpatient services efficiency in Taiwan: A longitudinal study, Health Economics, 20, 10, pp. 1268-1280, (2011); Cruz A.M., Evaluating record history of medical devices using association discovery and clustering techniques, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 13, pp. 5292-5305, (2013); Danese P., Supplier integration and company performance: A configurational view, Omega, 41, 6, pp. 1029-1041, (2013); Davis R.N., No more chances for supply-chain savings?

For this reason, companies must have knowledge of the actual standing of their products on the Web. A warning system for online market research is being proposed which allows the identification of critical situations in online opinion formation. When critical situations are detected, warnings are subsequently sent to marketing managers and thus allowing marketers the ability to initiate preventive measures. The warning system operates on a knowledge base which contains product-related success values, online opinions and patterns of social interactions. This knowledge is acquired using methods coming from information extraction, text mining and social network analysis. Based on this knowledge the warning system judges situations accordingly. For this purpose, a neuro-fuzzy approach is chosen which learns linguistic rules from data. These rules are employed to estimate future situations. The warning system is applied to two scenarios and yields good results. An evaluation shows that all components of the warning system outperform alternative methods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

With reference to the EKB model specific to consumer behavior, this paper discusses the relationship among consumption characteristics, firm selection behavior and satisfaction degree of refurbishment customers. 242 valid questionnaire copies were collected from refurbishment customers, and analyzed using Decision Tree Analysis and Association Rules in Data Mining. The research results show that, over half of the customers tend to entrust the refurbishment to well-reputed firms. Moreover, the integrity of refurbishment equipment, response of refurbishment personnel, professionalism and confidence are key elements in service quality (SQ). The best marketing policy for the customers is one which provides more attractive services. These research findings may provide a useful reference for innovative refurbishment firms in their decision-making.","Business strategy; Consumer behavior; Datamining; EKB model; Refurbishment industry; Service quality","Associative processing; Data mining; Decision trees; Quality of service; Research; Sales; Strategic planning; Business strategy; Consumer behavior; Consumer behaviors; EKB model; Service Quality; Customer satisfaction","","","","","National Science Council, NSC","Financial support (NSC 95-2622-E-151-007-CC3) from Taiwan’s National Science Council is gratefully acknowledged.

In particular, we investigated the beneficial effect of adding the voice of customers through call center emails - i.e. textual information - to a churn-prediction system that only uses traditional marketing information. We found that adding unstructured, textual information into a conventional churn-prediction model resulted in a significant increase in predictive performance. From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to better identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were derived from a number of individuals who received in-patient care at a health network in 2006. Data mining and conventional hierarchical clustering with average linkage and Pearson correlation procedures are employed and compared to show how each procedure best determines segmentation variables. Findings: Data mining tools identified three differentiable segments by means of cluster analysis. These three clusters have significantly different demographic profiles. Practical implications: The study reveals, when compared with traditional statistical methods, that data mining provides an efficient and effective tool for market segmentation. When there are numerous cluster variables involved, researchers and practitioners need to incorporate factor analysis for reducing variables to clearly and meaningfully understand clusters. Originality/value: Interests and applications in data mining are increasing in many businesses. However, this technology is seldom applied to healthcare customer experience management. The paper shows that efficient and effective application of data mining methods can aid the understanding of patient healthcare preferences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data analysis; Market segmentation;

Traditional approach of applying intelligent techniques to solve complex manufacturing problems is to build an expert system. Conventional process of building an expert systems is labor intensive to elicit knowledge from the human experts. We thus propose a novel technique of automatic knowledge acquisition by means of the data mining method to remedy the problem and help supporting intelligent manufacturing systems. Knowledge in our tool can be discovered from the stored data using the decision tree induction algorithm. The learned tree structure is then transformed to a rule set that can be integrated into the knowledge base.

Technologies such as data warehousing, data mining, and campaign management software have made customer relationship management a new area where firms can gain a competitive advantage. Particularly through data mining-the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases-organizations can identify valuable customers, predict future behaviors, and enable firms to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. The automated, future-oriented analyses made possible by data mining move beyond the analyses of past events typically provided by history-oriented tools such as decision support systems. Data mining tools answer business questions that in the past were too time-consuming to pursue. Yet, it is the answers to these questions make customer relationship management possible. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each with their own advantages and challenges for different types of applications. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). While differing approaches abound in the realm of data mining, the use of some type of data mining is necessary to accomplish the goals of today's customer relationship management philosophy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The research presented is a longitudinal, exploratory and descriptive case study, covering a three-year period during a critical development phase of a medium-size, national employer association which sought to improve the quality of marketing-based insights to its strategic planning capability as well as improve economic outcomes. Findings - It is possible to achieve profitable and capability enhancing integration of diverse marketing information management techniques. Successful integration and the use of a highly focused cross-functional team generated better market strategies and bottom line benefits. Practical implications - The need to generate greater insight from popular marketing information management and planning techniques is routinely experienced by marketing and other executive decision makers. This article provides a multi-year roadmap of the successful execution of technique integration, including identifying barriers that arose as well as suggesting solutions for achieving progress. Originality/value - There are very few case studies published that demonstrate the successful evolution and integration of CI, CRM, DM and MR into the enterprise's strategy-making process. The unique element of this example is that it was achieved within the context of a medium-sized, national, not-for-profit employer association. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Competitive strategy;

Even in the early days, some data mining approaches relied on traditional OR methods such as linear programming and forecasting, and modern data mining methods are based on a wide variety of OR methods including linear and quadratic optimization, genetic algorithms and concepts based on artificial ant colonies. The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance. In this paper, we outline a series of upcoming trends and challenges for data mining and its role within OR. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: A data mining approach using decision tree analysis (DTA) generates two comparative models (i.e. millennial versus generation X and millennial versus baby boomers) of interactive media usage across 21 technology applications. A large national sample (n=3,289) sourced from the Kantar Retail IQ constitutes the data for the models. Findings: Millennial respondents indicate significantly higher usage of interactive media compared to both generation X and boomers across 14 applications. Models indicate that millennials use interactive technologies for utilitarian/information gathering purposes as well as for entertainment. However, they are less likely to purchase online compared to their older counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Models provide evidence that both supports and extends previous research into interactive media from a uses and gratifications perspective. Findings suggest theoretical directions for research for economic versus emotional uses of interactive media. Practical implications: Findings suggest that while millennials are adept at using technology for research and interactive purposes they tend to buy in stores, presenting opportunities for multiple channel marketers and challenges for those who market online exclusively. Originality/value: The paper provides a realistic, comprehensive empirical model of interactive consumer behaviors across three prominent US cohorts within the current generational cycle. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cohort analysis; Decision trees; Individual behaviour; Interactive marketing; Marketing starategy; Millennial generation; User studies","","","","","","","","Belch M.A., Krentler K.A., Willis-Flurry L.A., Teen internet mavens: Influence in family decision making, Journal of Business Research, 58, pp. 569-575, (2005); Grant I.C., Young people's relationships with online marketing practices: An intrusion too far?, Journal of Marketing Management, 21, 5-6, pp. 607-623, (2005); Grant I.C., O'Donohoe S., Why young consumers are not open to mobile marketing communication, International Journal of Advertising, 26, 2, pp. 223-246, (2007); Henrie K.M., Taylor D.C., Use of persuasion knowledge by the millennial generation, Young Consumers, 10, 1, pp. 71-81, (2009); Howe N., Strauss W., Generations: The History of America's Future 1584-2069, (1991); Katz E., Blumler J.G., Gurevitch M., Utilization of mass communication by the individual, The Uses of Mass Communications: Current Perspectives on Gratifications Research, pp. 19-32, (1974); Kavounis Y., The millennial effect, Brand Strategy, pp. 49-51, (2008); Leug J., Ponder N., Beatty S.E., Capella M.L., Teenagers' use of alternative shopping channels: A consumer socialization perspective, Journal of Retailing, 82, 2, pp. 137-153, (2006); Reisenwitz T.H., Iyer R., Differences in generation X and generation Y: Implications for the organization and marketers, The Marketing Management Journal, 19, 2, pp. 91-103, (2009); Rentz J.O., Reynolds F.D., Stout R.G., Analyzing changing consumption patterns with cohort analysis, Journal of Marketing Research, 20, pp. 12-20, (1983); Reynolds F.D., Rentz J.O., Cohort analysis: An aid to strategic planning, Journal of Marketing, 45, pp. 62-70, (1981); Ruggiero T.E., Uses and gratifications theory in the 21st century, Mass Communication & Society, 3, 1, pp. 3-37, (2000); Schewe C.D., Meredith G., Segmenting global markets by generational cohorts: Determining motivations by age, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 4, 1, pp. 51-63, (2004); Sullivan P., Heitmeyer J., Looking at gen.

They struggle to find answers to: • Who can I consider a loyal customer? • What kind of marketing strategy is most likely to increase sales? • What can customer-purchasing patterns reveal about improving inventory control? • What is the most effective way to manage customer relations to increase revenues? (Rabinovitch, 1999). With the exponential growth in the amount of data being collected, improvements in technology, and research in machine learning, retailers are now able to reduce the ever growing difficult and complex decision making process by recruiting the efforts of data mining (Barry & Linoff, 1997). Data mining is a computerized technology that uses complicated algorithms to find relationships and trends in large data bases, real or perceived, previously unknown to the retailer, to promote decision support. Currently being utilized by such retail giants as Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom, and Wal-Mart, Inc., data mining is touted to be one of the greatest technologies to hit the retailing industry this decade (Rabinovitch, 1999). The purpose of this study is to critique data mining technology in comparison with more familiar analytical tools for strategic decision making by small to medium size retailers. The context for this study includes current and future industry applications and practices for research performed in data mining applications within the retail sector.","Data mining; Decision making; Marketing strategy; Retailers; Strategic planning; Technology","","","","","","","","Anderson J.L., Profiles of Successful Graduate Students Using Artificial Neural Networking and Simultaneous Multiple Regression, (2001); Arlitt M., Krishnamurthy D., Rolia J., Characterizing the scalability of large web-based shopping systems, ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, (1), 1, pp. 44-69, (2001); Berkin P., Beche J.D., Randall D.J., Interactive path analysis of web site traffic, American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Proceedings, pp. 414-419, (2001); Berry M.J.A., Linoff G., Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales and Customer Support, (1997); Brijs T., Swinnen G., Vanhoof K., Wets G., Using association rules for product assortment decisions: A case study, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, (1999); Brijs T., Goethals B., Swinnen G., Vanhoof K., Wets G., A data mining framework for optimal product selection in a retail supermarket: The generalized PROFSET model, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, (2000); Cabena P., Hadjinian P., Stadler R., Verhees J., Zanasi A., Discovering Data Mining: from Concept to Implementation, (1998); Data mining/CRM: Searching for an ROI, Chain Store Age, pp. 24-26, (2001); Data Mining: What Is Data Mining?; An Overview of Data Mining at Dun and Bradstreet, (1995); Decker P., Data mining's hidden dangers, Banking Strategies, 74, 2, pp. 6-14, (1998); Dhond A., Gupta A., Vadhavkar S., Data mining techniques for optimizing inventories for electronic commerce, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 480-486, (2000); Do-it-yourself data mining, Marketing Computers, 16, 11, pp. 1-2, (1996); Foley J., Russell J.D., Mining your own business, Informationweek, 673, pp. 18-20, (1998); Fonseca B., Personalization and web analysis sink in, Infoworld, (22), 29, (2000); Growing lifetime value, Chain Store Age, (75), 5, (1999); Hollander G., Model 1 deftly pares customer characteristics, Infoworld, 20, 21, (1998); Kempster M., Digging for data, Inform, 12, 6, pp. 22-30, (1998); Keen P.G.W., Let's focus on action not info, Computerworld, (1997); Kroll K.M., Sears Canada gains improved customer knowledge with data mining and analysis, Stores, (83), 4, pp. 128-129, (2001); Lee J., Podlaseck M., Using a starfield visualization of ranalyzing product performance of online stores, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 168-175, (2000); Lee J., Podlaseck M., Schonberg E., Hoch R., Visualization and analysis of click stream data of online stores for understanding web merchandising, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (5), 1-2, pp. 59-84, (2001); Maselli J., Business-intelligence pays off for Nordstrom, Information Week, (825), (2001); Mining the store, Chain Store Age, 76, 1, pp. 4-5, (2000); Murphy P.A., Focus on existing customers seen driving revenue growth, Stores, pp. 32-34, (1998); Parks L., Information resources inc, Drug Store News, (22), 9, pp. 219-222, (2000); Peacock P.R., Data mining in marketing: Part 1, Marketing Management, pp. 9-18, (1998); Press S., Fool's gold, Sales and Marketing Management, 150, 6, pp. 58-62, (1998); Rabinovitch L., America's ""first"" department store mines customer data, Direct Marketing, (62), 8, (1999); Ritzer J.R., New rule-based systems tackle employee shrink, Stores, (78), 8, pp. 71-72, (1996); Rubbermaid mines for profits, Discount Store News, (38), 6, (1999); Small R.D., Debunking Data Mining Myths.
