The paper explores decision-making for turning an ambitious vision (automation of enterprise-based sales and marketing activities) into a focused application (pricing configuration software), and then into a large software house (Trilogy) offering enterprise e-commerce suites. Trilogy’s management team’s decision-making was heavily influenced by a strong perception that the organization needed to take risks to achieve “critical mass” in anticipation of a convergence of “back-office” and “front-office” applications into one market. The advanced case study also addresses Trilogy’s transition of its applications into Internet environments, plus the transformation of the organization from a product-orientation to a strictly industry-based business and application development perspective. Trilogy has not compromised its strict application development philosophies, but has incorporated its fast cycle time (FCT) methods into its industry-focused business divisions – and now actually offers the method as a set of services. © Hugh M.

Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women's preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automated vehicles; Car-sharing; Electric vehicles; Ride-hailing; Technology adoption; Transportation decisions","California; San Francisco Bay; United States; Adaptive cruise control; Behavioral research; Commerce; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Plug-in electric vehicles; Automated vehicles; Electrified vehicles; Emerging technologies; Ride-hailing; Technology adoption; Transportation system; Transportation technology; Younger generations; car use; electric vehicle; innovation; technology adoption; transportation system; transportation technology; unmanned vehicle; Automation","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); Idaho National Laboratory, INL","Funding text 1: More detail on this study and the DOE program it is funded by can be found in Appendix A in the supplementary materials. 4 The online instrument is part of a larger WholeTraveler Transportation Behavior Study that aims to understand travel choice patterns, preferences, and decision-making processes in the context of new mobility technologies, with a focus on the San Francisco Bay Area. ; Funding text 2: This paper and the work described were sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) under the Systems and Modeling for Accelerated Research in Transportation (SMART) Mobility Laboratory Consortium, an initiative of the Energy Efficient Mobility Systems (EEMS) Program, under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231, and under Contract to Idaho National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

We invoke the term to refer to the convergence of populism as a marketing tool–a way of selling, for example, nutritional supplements or survivalist merchandise–with political strategies that cater to the citizen as consumer (whose freedoms are framed in the individual register of personal taste unfettered from civic concerns or constraints). Perhaps unsurprisingly in this context, we draw on the example of Donald Trump's political rise, which while not unrelated to his particular idiosyncrasies, demonstrates how the automated curation of social media aligns itself with what the aggressive rise of commercial populism. The goal of such an analysis is to consider how the combination of hyper-commercialism with the formal attributes of social media contributes to inter-related political pathologies of polarization and conspiracy theory. The consumer-oriented model of personal taste catered to by algorithmic curation highlights the paradox of ‘social’ media: they promise to enhance the social by displacing or reframing it fundamental a-social. The offloading of social decisions and formation onto commercial, automated systems for curating news and information reinforces this version of individualism, contributing to the forms of misrecognition that enable it. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automation; Donald Trump; filter bubble; political polarization; Populism; social media","","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE200100005)","This work was supported by Australian Research Council: [Grant Number CE200100005].","Anderson B., Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, (2006); Arendt H., The human condition, (1958); Baragona J., (2020); Benen S., (2020); Bernstein J.M., Recovering ethical life: Jürgen Habermas and the future of critical theory, (2014); Bickart B., Fournier S., Nisenholtz M., (2017); Bond P., (2016); Boxell L., Gentzkow M., Shapiro J.M., Greater Internet use is not associated with faster growth in political polarization among US demographic groups, Proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 114, 40, pp. 10612-10617, (2017); Brown W., (2017); Bruns A., Are filter bubbles real?, (2019); Buettner R., Craig S., McIntire M., (2020); Bump P., (2017); Carmi E., Rhythmedia: A study of Facebook’s immune system, Theory, culture & society, 37, 5, pp. 119-138, (2020); Debord G., Comments on the society of the spectacle, (1998); Ferber A., (2020); Greenwald G., (2020); Haberman M., (2016); Herman E.S., Chomsky N., Manufacturing consent: the political economy of the mass media, (2010); Habermas J., Three normative models of democracy, Constellations, 1, 1, pp. 1-10, (1994); Johnson P.E., The art of masculine victimhood: Donald Trump’s demagoguery, Women’s studies in communication, 40, 3, pp. 229-250, (2017); Krugman P., (2018); Laclau E., Populism: what’s in a name, Populism and the mirror of democracy, pp. 103-114, (2004); Lanier J., Ten arguments for deleting your social media accounts right now, (2018); Lewis P., (2018); Ma A., (2021); Maiberg E., (2018); McAllister M.P., Applequist J., Commercialization of politics, The international encyclopedia of political communication, pp. 1-5, (2015); McChesney R., The political economy of media: enduring issues, emerging dilemmas, (2008); Phelan S., Dahlberg L., Introduction: post-marxist discourse theory and critical political economy, Critical discourse studies, 11, 3, pp. 255-256, (2014); Peters J.D., The marvelous clouds: toward a philosophy of elemental media, (2015); Perlstein R., (2012); Picheta R., (2019); Pratte R., Civic education in a democracy, Theory into practice, 27, 4, pp. 303-308, (1988); Samuels B., (2019); Schouten F., Wright D., (2020); Schudson M., Discovering the news: A social history of American newspapers, (1978); Schudson M., My very own alternative facts about journalism, Trump and the media, pp. 41-48, (2018); Sunstein C.R., Republic.com, (2001); Swasey B., (2020); Tufekci Z., How social media took us from Tahrir Square to Donald Trump, MIT technology review, 121, 5, pp. 23-26, (2018); Waisbord S., Tucker T., Lichtenheld Z., Trump and the great disruption in public communication, Trump and the media, pp. 25-32, (2018); Zizek S., Against the populist temptation, Critical inquiry, 32, 3, pp. 551-574, (2006); Zurcher A., (2020)","M.

Production cycle can be shortened in the phase of product designing and selecting, sampling, production and distribution. But how can the manufacturer decide for a certain product quickly and correctly? Primarily by using CAD/CAM system during the whole process, from idea, pattern, eleboration of technical data, sampling, preparation of production to final production. Another very important factor that additionally increases the importance of CAD/CAM systems is the globalization of the entire production process. Data transmission via internet is quick and considerably facilitates communications between buyers and manufacturers and remote production units. Textile CAD/CAM systems are mainly modularly structured and cover dobby weaving, jacquard weaving and all other textile fields. Optionally available are the packages for 3D simulation and marketing, compact discs with patterns and collections catalogues and virtual fashion shows. Systems for dobby and jacquard weaving are highly improved and simulations in proper density and by considering all constructional parameters look quite realistic. The paper presents some CAD/CAM systems, their features and advantages. The future will be characterized by full automation of the process from the buyer's order to the final production of fabric, which means immediate response and higher flexibility.","CAD/CAM systems; Communication; Designing of dobby fabrics; Designing of jacquard fabrics; Fabric simulation; Internet integration; ITMA","computer aided design; computer aided production; dobby loom; jacquard loom; weaving","","","","","","","","M.B.

The methodology of the research is based on methods of system analysis, cybernetics, pedagogical psychology and didacticism. A conceptual model of the EIEE EI as an organizational and technical system has been proposed. It includes a marketing subsystem, a set of technical tools, various types of security and an organizational subsystem. The main functions of these subsystems and their various components have been identified. A didactic model of a typical complex of digital educational resources has been developed. Within this model, the diversity of digital educational resources across each academic discipline is integrated into complexes that provide a complete study at different target levels of assimilation, from initial acquaintance to solving uncharacteristic professionally oriented tasks. From the point of view of pedagogical psychology and cybernetics, the high importance of feedback in EIEE EI is shown. The classification of feedbacks (internal and external) is proposed for the triad ""Teacher - Teaching Program - Learner"". The limits of the use of automation in the formation of feedbacks are specified, as opposed to other (non-computer) responses to students' educational activities. The role and place of feedback in the ""digital footprints"" of students and teachers is shown and the directions for the use of this data in artificial intelligence systems are outlined. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Design/methodology/approach - Data in the form of essays were collected from 62 professionals. The constant comparative method and open coding were used in analysis of the data. Findings - Advances in technology were identified as a driving force behind changes in fashion production and retailing. The total automation and wide adoption of mass customization were foreseen, along with continuous improvement to information technology. Some participants predicted that most production would continue to be sourced offshore. Others believed that apparel production would remain and even grow within the USA. To counter global competition, several strategies were identified. While online shopping was predicted to increase, brick and mortar stores would remain. Through the combination of different types of stores, new types of store would emerge, and consolidation of retail businesses would continue. Future consumer preferences as well as strategies to become competitive retailers were identified. Practical implications - The findings can help academics in developing research ideas and making curricular decisions. Originality/value - The examination of professionals' opinions in this paper may provide insights into the future useful for making decisions on career directions, selecting educational experiences, making investments, and planning strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fashion industry; Forecasting; Production management; Retailing; United States of America","clothing industry; fashion; forecasting; marketing; production; retailing","","","","","","","Alexander S., Mass Customization, (1999); Anderson-Connell L.J., Ulrich P.V., Brannon E.L., A consumer-driven model for mass customization in the apparel market, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 6, 3, pp. 240-58, (2002); Barbaro M., White B., Retail chain looks to build on momentum, Washington Post, (2005); Cope N., Retail in the Digital Age, (1996); The Meanings of Dress, (1999); Dickson M.A., US consumers' knowledge of and concern with apparel sweatshops, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 3, 1, pp. 44-55, (1999); Fiore A.M., Lee S., Kunz G., Campbell J.R., Relationship between optimum stimulation level and willingness to use mass customization options, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 5, 2, pp. 99-107, (2001); Gilmore J.H., Pine II B.J., The four faces of mass customization, Harvard Business Review, 75, 1, pp. 91-102, (1997); Gogoi P., Retailers shop - or they'll drop?, Business Week Online, (2005); Hays C., More luster lost from palaces of retailing, New York Times, (2005); Kalman J., Hi-tech highlights of sewing machinery market, Bobbin, pp. 60-1, (1996); Kamali N., Loker S., Mass customization: On-line consumer involvement in product design, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 7, 4, (2002); Kim E., Johnson K.K.P., The US apparel industry: Futuring with undergraduate students in apparel majors, Clothing and Textile Research Journal, 25, 4, pp. 283-306, (2007); Ko E., Kincade D.H., Product line characteristics as determinants of quick response implementation for US apparel manufacturers, Clothing and Textile Research Journal, 16, 1, pp. 11-18, (1998); Morgado M.A., Coming to terms with postmodern: Theories and concepts of contemporary culture and their implications for apparel scholars, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 14, 1, pp. 41-53, (1996); O'Rourke D., Opportunities and obstacles for corporate responsibility reporting in developing countries, World Bank/International Finance Corporation, (2004); Peterson R.A., A context for retailing predictions, The Future of US Retailing, pp. 1-25, (1992); Reichard R., New year offers problems and opportunities, Textile World, 150, 1, pp. 20-7, (2000); Cambridge Reports, (1989); Sheth J., Sisodia R., Consumer behavior in the future, Electronic Marketing and the Consumer, pp. 17-38, (1997); Vogel D., The Market for Virtue, (2005); Wood S.L., Future fantasies: A social change perspective of retailing in the 21st century, Journal of Retailing, 78, pp. 77-83, (2002); Yan H., Fiorito S., Effects of managerial factors on apparel CAD/CAM adoption, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the International Textile and Apparel Association, (2003); Strauss A., Corbin J., Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques, (1990)","E.

TAC presents a challenging travel-shopping scenario where agents must satisfy client preferences for complementary and substitutable goods by interacting through a variety of market types. Michigan's entry, Walverine, bases its decisions on a competitive (Walrasian) analysis of the TAC travel economy, Using this Walrasian model, we construct a decision-theoretic formulation of the optimal bidding problem, which Walverine solves in each round of bidding for each good. Walverine's optimal bidding approach, as well as several other features of its overall strategy, are potentially applicable in a broad class of trading environments. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Background: Although the human factors literature is replete with articles about trust (and distrust) in automation, there is little on the related, but distinct, construct of ""suspicion"" (in either automated or IT contexts). The construct of suspicion-its precise definition, theoretical correlates, and role in such applications-deserves further study. Method: Literatures that consider suspicion are reviewed and integrated. Literatures include communication, psychology, human factors, management, marketing, information technology, and brain/neurology. We first develop a generic model of state-level suspicion. Research propositions are then derived within IT contexts. Results: Fundamental components of suspicion include (a) uncertainty, (b) increased cognitive processing (e.g., generation of alternative explanations for perceived discrepancies), and (c) perceptions of (mal)intent. State suspicion is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of these three components. Our analysis also suggests that trust inhibits suspicion, whereas distrust can be a catalyst of state-level suspicion. Based on a three-stage model of state-level suspicion, associated research propositions and questions are developed. These propositions and questions are intended to help guide future work on the measurement of suspicion (self-report and neurological), as well as the role of the construct of suspicion in models of decision making and detection of deception. Conclusion: The study of suspicion, including its correlates, antecedents, and consequences, is important. We hope that the social sciences will benefit from our integrated definition and model of state suspicion. The research propositions regarding suspicion in IT contexts should motivate substantial research in human factors and related fields.

While acknowledging the capabilities of AI chatbots to handle customer interactions and improve response times, we critically examine several challenges they present, including interoperability challenges, data protection concerns, and biased output. This research presents a novel framework for managers to assess a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM), which has been adapted to account for the critical challenges associated with the emerging technology. Incorporating four factors—subjective norms, compatibility, facilitating conditions, and trust—allows for a more holistic assessment of a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology. The framework, together with a readiness assessment tool, provides a comprehensive mechanism for managerial decision-making, focusing on the adoption of AI chatbots in customer service, sales, and marketing business functions. In exploring these factors, our article explores the managerial implications of integrating AI chatbots into business processes, ensuring an informed and holistic approach to technology adoption. © 2024 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Artificial intelligence;

Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service","","","","","","Groningen Digital Business Center","The authors wish to convey their appreciation to the special issue editors Nicolai Fabian, Evert de Haan, and in particular thank Arnd Vomberg as the editor of this paper for his insightful and valuable inputs and constructive feedback during the entire review process.

Investments in automation of manufacturing are more likely to succeed if they are the expression of informed and systematic decisions. This paper aims to increase the knowledge on the process leading to investment decisions on automation of manufacturing in the wood products industry, as well as on the aspects considered in such processes. A real-time case study was conducted at a large Swedish wood manufacturing company to gain in-depth understanding of decisions related to automation investments. The findings demonstrate that mainly representatives from manufacturing and marketing functions were involved throughout the investment project's length. This could be a contributing factor to the narrow view on automation of manufacturing when decisions are made, where focus is placed on financial and technological aspects. The findings further show a limited knowledge regarding automation of manufacturing, which resulted in a tendency to heavily rely on the technical supplier’s recommendations.

Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems, and other issues. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.","Cross-border outsourcing; Customer relationship management; Global marketing; International marketing; Offshore outsourcing; Offshoring","","","","","","","","Abbott A., The System of Professions, (1988); Abraham K.G., Restructuring the employment relationship, New developments in labor market: Toward a new institutional paradigm, pp. 85-119, (1990); Abraham K.G., Taylor S.K., Firm's use of outside contractors: Theory and evidence, (1993); Agrawal M., Kishore R., Rao H.R., Market reactions to e-business outsourcing announcements: an event study, Information Management, 43, October, pp. 861-873, (2006); Aksin Z.O., Masini A., Effective strategies for internal outsourcing and offshoring of business services: an empirical investigation, Journal of Operations Management, 26, pp. 239-256, (2008); Anderson E.W., Fornell C., Rust R.T., Customer satisfaction, productivity, and profitability: differences between goods and services, Marketing Science, 16, 2, pp. 129-145, (1997); Anderson E., Gatignon H., Modes of foreign entry: a transaction cost analysis and propositions, Journal of International Business Studies, 17, Autumn, pp. 1-26, (1986); Ang S., Straub D.W., Production and transaction economies and IS outsourcing: a study of the US banking industry, MIS Quarterly, 22, December, pp. 535-552, (1998); Bain J.S., Barriers to New Competition, (1956); Baker P., No Free Lunch: Why customer service outsourcing doesn't work, (2004); Barkema H.G., Vermeulen F., International expansion through start-up or acquisition: a learning perspective, Academy of Management Journal, 41, February, pp. 7-27, (1998); Barnett W.P., The dynamics of competitive intensity, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, March, pp. 128-160, (1997); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, March, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bergen M., Dutta S., Walker Jr. O.C., Agency relationships in marketing: a review of the implications and applications of agency and related theories, Journal of Marketing, 56, July, pp. 1-24, (1992); Bhalla A., Sodhi M.S., Son B.G., Is More IT offshoring better?

However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs)","","","","","","","","Sofla M.S., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Mirzaee R.F., Towards Effective Offloading Mechanisms in Fog Computing, Multimed.

Drawing on the status quo bias as a theoretical framework, this article investigates the role of nostalgia in consumer reactions to product automation in a series of six experiments with almost 1500 participants. The first four experiments converge on a consistent finding: a high (versus low) degree of automation reduces consumers' nostalgic feelings about past consumption episodes, which in turn decrease nostalgia-prone consumers' product evaluations. Against this backdrop, we conduct two additional experiments to determine how firms' communication tactics can overcome the negative role of nostalgia proneness in consumer reactions to automated products. We conclude that managers involved in the marketing of automated products should assess the level of nostalgia in their target groups, and align both their intended positioning for the automated product and the decision to automate critical tasks within the product design that may evoke nostalgic feelings in consumers. Furthermore, when consumers are nostalgia-prone, managers should craft their launch communication tactics such that the focus is diverted from the automated task itself. © 2022 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This investigation is based on survey data collected from 3,663 customers of seven mainly municipal energy suppliers in the German energy market. The data set was analyzed via a binary logistic regression model to identify the most prospective customers and their preferences regarding bundles of energy services. Findings: The results indicate that potential adopters of energy-related service bundles have greater prior knowledge about service bundles; place higher importance on simplified handling, flat rates and long price guarantees; prefer to purchase a service bundle from an energy supplier; live in urban areas and have a gas tariff; are both less likely to have a green electricity tariff and to support the German energy transition; have a greater intention to purchase a smart home product; are less likely to already be prosumers; and prefer customer centers and social media as communication channels with energy providers. Practical implications: This paper offers several implications for decision-makers in developing marketing strategies for bundled offerings in a highly competitive energy market. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the sparse research on service bundles in the energy sector, despite the growing interest of energy suppliers and consumers in this topic. It expands the research focusing on the telecommunications sector. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision-making; Energy sector; Energy service bundle; Mail questionnaires; Marketing implications; Preferences; Purchase intention; Regression; Residential; Retailing; Surveys","Automation; Decision making; Power markets; Purchasing; Regression analysis; Sales; Decisions makings; Energy sector; Energy service bundle; Energy services; Mail questionnaires; Marketing implication; Preference; Purchase intention; Retailing; Service bundles; Surveys","","","","","Energieversorgung Filstal GmbH and Co.; Stadtwerke Landsberg KU; Stadtwerke Rottenburg am Neckar GmbH; Stadtwerke Waldshut-Tiengen GmbH; Südwestdeutsche Stromhandels GmbH","This study was enabled by a grant received from Südwestdeutsche Stromhandels GmbH, Energieversorgung Filstal GmbH and Co.

There are aspects of both art and engineering required to make this integration appear seamless.

AI advances could conceivably automate everything: marketing, customer service, underwriting and claims management alike. However, such automation challenges consumer trust, as there is considerable public and scholarly debate over the ‘black box’ character of many algorithms. Insurance being a business of trust, this suggests a dilemma. One suggested solution involves adopting algorithms in a transparent manner. This article reports a study of how Swedish insurers deal with this dilemma, based on (i) eight interviews with insurance professionals representing four companies with a joint market share of 45–50% of the Swedish property insurance market and (ii) a questionnaire answered by 71 professionals in a Swedish insurance company. The results show that while transparency is seen as potentially valuable, most Swedish insurers do not use it to gain a competitive advantage or identify clear limits to transparency and are not using AI extensively. © 2021, The Geneva Association.","Competitive advantage; Insurance; Openness; Sweden; Transparency; Trust","","","","","","Stiftelsen Länsförsäkringsbolagens Forskningsfond, (P4/18)","","Abdul A.J., Vermeulen D., Wang B.Y., Limkankanhalli M., Trends and trajectories for explainable, accountable and intelligible systems: An HCI research agenda, Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-18, (2018); Adams J.E., Highhouse S., Zickar M.J., Understanding general distrust of corporations, Corporate Reputation Review, 13, 1, (2010); Adebayo J.J., Gilmer M., Muelly I., Goodfellow M., Hardtkim B., Sanity checks for saliency maps, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 9505-9515, (2018); Andrews R., Diederich J., Tickle A.B., Survey and critique of techniques for extracting rules from trained artificial neural networks, Knowledge-Based Systems, 8, 6, pp. 373-389, (1995); Atchinson B.K., Walking the talk: Ethics as corporate culture, The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice, 29, 1, pp. 40-44, (2004); Barakat N., Bradley A.P., Rule extraction from support vector machines: A review, Neurocomputing, 74, 1-3, pp. 178-190, (2010); Bhaduri G., Ha-Brookshire J.E., Do transparent business practices pay?

This article focuses on portfolio construction using machine learning. Historically, algorithmic trading could be more narrowly defined as the automation of sell-side trade execution, but since the introduction of more advanced algorithms, the definition has grown to include idea generation, alpha factor design, asset allocation, position sizing, and the testing of strategies. Machine learning, from the vantage of a decision-making tool, can help in all these areas. © 2020, With intelligence.

Ltd., a rapidly growing digital marketing and automation service provider in India. CEO Jacob faced concern after presenting to a major client, Pragati, the founder of Villuvia.com, one of India’s top online jewellery brands. While email marketing had been a core strategy since the beginning, its return on investment had dwindled compared to social media advertising, exacerbated by a recent overhaul introducing a new digital marketing team. They excelled in social media but were new to email marketing software. Caspar Technologies unveiled cMercury, an AI-based technology to streamline email marketing campaigns. Although initial tests showed promise, it came at a five-fold cost compared to traditional email management software, which demanded extensive manual intervention. Jacob considered offering Villuvia a discount for the festive season but awaited Pragati’s decision. This would determine whether their budget would be allocated to email marketing, social media, or offline expansion. This case allows students to delve into email marketing intricacies, assess metrics and make quantitative evaluations. It also presents a platform for qualitative discussions on managerial dilemmas, like evaluating the digital team’s capabilities, prioritizing customer acquisition or retention and gauging the long-term viability of AI-powered email communication. © 2023 Lahore University of Management Sciences.","cMercury; digital marketing; email marketing; precision marketing; predictive email","","","","","","","","","K.

Field sales employees (n = 147) in a multinational organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were surveyed to test the research model. Four of 7 primary hypotheses were supported, predicting more than 65% of the variance in the research model. Effort expectancy, uncertainty avoidance, collective performance expectancy, and internal/organizational social influence all showed antecedent significance to contextual utilization of CRM technology. The results of this study suggest that group-oriented individual decision making and the related concept of institutional collectivism are equally as important as individual-oriented decision making in the international utilization of organizational technology. Based on the strong significance shown in the results of this study, it would also be wise to consider cultural value–derived uncertainty avoidance in practical development of training and implementation of multinational CRM systems. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","culture;

The 1982-83 factory automation surveys project of the Boston University Manufacturing Roundtable reported on here was designed to develop a broad managerial view of computer-aided manufacturing processes in the US. Our purpose was to create a body of information, drawn from the recent experience of leading-edge practitioners, that would begin to describe the range of behaviors accompanying the adoption and implementation of automation technologies, such as advanced numerical control, CAD/CAM and robots, which may be combined to form the ""factory of the future"". In short, we wanted to identify the kinds of progress being made by these manufacturers and the barriers that they, and those who are contemplating such process innovations, will face in the future. In each of our three surveys we had a specific target population in mind. The ""user"" survey was aimed at discrete-part manufacturing organizations that were leaders in adopting factory automation technologies. This survey was designed to address ""best practice"" at the level of a single strategic business unit and deals with specific automation projects. Our ""supplier"" survey was aimed at the major producers of each of the various factory automation technologies. Here we sought the observations and opinions of senior marketing executives in those firms with the most success (and therefore experience) in supplying computer-based manufacturing technologies. Finally, our ""expert"" survey was designed to test some of our preliminary findings from the users and suppliers, including insights gathered from in-depth follow-up telephone interviews with respondents to those two surveys. We intentionally tried to identify a broad sample of individuals whose views would be based on extensive factory automation experience in different capacities. Respondents to our three surveys consisted of 57 users, 38 suppliers and 64 experts. Findings from the three surveys form certain patterns that transcend the isolated facts commonly presented in the literature. The dominant impressions that emerged from the data were:. Leading-edge users of computer-aided manufacturing processes believe in learning by doing. Most have proceeded in an incremental fashion to develop an internal base of experience with factory automation technologies. They tend to have supportive management and a sense of where they are heading. Their current measurement capabilities, however, restrict the basis for making adoption decisions as well as the subsequent evaluation of impacts from recent technological innovations. These users usually rely heavily on outside suppliers for critical technical assistance and consider reliability factors to be more important than price in selecting a vendor. They generally feel they cannot afford to postpone decisions until improved technologies become available. Current leadingedge users will strongly affect the future direction of these technologies. Suppliers claim that most manufacturers are not sophisticated customers. They would like potential users to be more aware of their needs for improved manufacturing processes and to be more interested in the long-term strategic benefits of computer-aided manufacturing technologies already on the market. A classic dilemma seems to have arisen: decisions to adopt expensive factory automation technologies are often made by managers who lack the background to assess technological options, while staff familiar with the new technologies are less able to appreciate associated strategic dimensions. A likely outcome is a decision that is either short-sighted or misguided. Suppliers with limited direct experience in new applications of their technologies and little indepth knowledge of the business situations of their customers cannot be expected to help users avoid such errors. The most difficult problems in achieving computer integrated manufacturing are managerial rather than technical. Manufacturers contemplating factory automation face different issues depending on whether they adopt a retrofit strategy using existing production systems or whether they attempt to make a fresh start as new facilities are brought on stream. In either case, they often have inadequate internal technical resources, strong barriers to communication across traditional functional lines, and a reward structure that does not encourage risk-taking in the interest of long-term strategic gains. Manufacturing organizations that do not deal directly with these kinds of managerial problems are not likely to succeed in factory automation, even if appropriate technological options exist. These functions suggest that manufacturing managers ought to reflect on their organization's current strengths and weaknesses as they formulate a strategy for factory automation. In particular, they should begin with a healthy concern for the adequacy of their current base of knowledge, mix of human resources and formal measurement systems. They should also refine their expectations for integrated factory automation applications, to be sure that general goals such as ""enhanced flexibility"" have explicit operational meanings. Finally, they should improve their organization's ability to identify types of indirect costs, as well as benefits, that are implicit in such goals. These prescriptions apply to manufacturers just beginning to adopt programmable manufacturing technologies, as well as to those who are well along this path. Further in-depth research is needed if the progress being made by leading-edge users is to serve as a basis for more widespread attempts to move toward the ""factory of the future"". © 1984.","","","","","","","","","Bylinksy, The Race to the Automatic Factory, Fortune, (1983); Frohman, Technology As a Competitive Weapon, Harvard Business Review, (1982); Gerwin, Tarondeau, Case Studies of Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems: A View of Uncertainty and Innovation Processes, Journal of Operations Management, 2, 2, pp. 87-89, (1982); Gold, CAM Sets New Rules for Productivity, Harvard Business Review, (1982); Goldhar, Jelinek, Plan for Economies of Scope, Harvard Business Review, (1983); Gunn, The Mechanization of Design and Manufacturing, Scientific American, (1982); Hayes, Abernathy, Managing our Way to Economic Decline, Harvard Business Review, (1980); Kantrow, The Strategy-Technology Connection, Harvard Business Review, (1980); Kimnicun, Flexible Systems Invade the Factory, High Technology, (1983); Miller, The 1983 Manufacturing Futures Project: Summary of North American Survey Responses and Preliminary Report, (1983); Sfiligoj, $10M Machining Cell Is Keystone For Vought's Plant of the Future, Metal Working News, (1983); Smith, Et al., CAD/CAM International Delphi Forecast, (1980); Yin, The Case Study as a Serious Research Strategy, Knowledge, 3, 1, pp. 97-114, (1981); Zaltman, Duncan, Holbek, Innovations and Organizations, (1973); The Computer: The Tool for Today, American Machinist, Special Report 746, (1982)","","","","","","","","","02726963","","JOTME","","English","J Oper Manage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000720545"

Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Online reviews; Review synthesis; Wine reviews","","","","","","2020 Northeast; Machine Learning, and Business Analytics","We thank the Editor, Area Editor, and two anonymous IJRM reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

A total of 103 usable questionnaires were returned from corporate buyers from five major department store chains located throughout the USA, yielding a 41 percent response rate. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the modified portion of Sheth's model used in this study was satisfactory in exploring relationships that exist between buyers and vendors when determining what products can be placed on AR. The model was significant and respectable in explanatory power, and the significant or highly related variables were: merchandise driven mentality; price/value; color; design; and type of merchandise category. These were all significant or highly related to the buyer's willingness to trade off on the negotiation variables (price, packaging, delivery and assortment). Future research is needed to explore the development of a model that explains the process and decision criteria for successful AR programs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Buyers; Channel relationships; Quick response retailing; Reorder levels; Retail management","automation; buyer; buying; marketing; research and development; retailing","","","","","","","Abernathy F.H., Dunlop J.T., Hammond J.H., Weil D., A Stitch in Time: Lean Retailing and the Transformation of Manufacturing - Lessons from the Apparel and Textile Industries, (1999); Anthony C., Jolly L., The influence of uncertainty on ratings of information importance by retail apparel buyers, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 10, pp. 1-7, (1991); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, pp. 396-402, (1977); Babbie E., The Practice of Social Research, (1998); Daugherty P., Myers M., Autry M.C., Automatic replenishment programs: An empirical examination, The Journal of Business Logistics, 20, pp. 63-82, (1999); Ettenson R., Wagner J., Retail buyer salability judgments: A comparison of information across three levels of experience, Journal of Retailing, 62, pp. 41-63, (1986); Fairhurst A., Fiorito S., Retail buyers' decision-making process: An investigation of contributing variables, International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 1, pp. 87-100, (1990); Fiorito S.S., Testing a portion of Sheth's theory of merchandise-buying behavior with small apparel firms, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 14, pp. 19-34, (1990); Fiorito S., Giunipero L., Oh J., Channel relationships and quick response implementation, 10th Annual International Conference on Research in the Distributive Trades, Stirling, (1999); Fiorito S.S., May E., Straughn K., Quick response in retailing: Components and implementation, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 23, pp. 12-21, (1995); Fiorito S., Giunipero L., Yan H., Retail buyers' perceptions of quick response, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 23, pp. 237-244, (1998); Francis S., Brown D., Retail buyers of apparel and appliances: A comparison, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 4, pp. 1-8, (1985); Hirschman E., An exploratory comparison of decision criteria used by retail buyers, Proceedings: Patronage Theory Conference, (1981); Hunter N.A., Quick Response in Apparel Manufacturing, (1990); Johnsen N., Answering the tough QR questions, Bobbin, 36, pp. 58-59, (1997); Kincade D., Cassill N., Company demographics as an influence on adoption of quick response by North Carolina manufacturers, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 11, pp. 3-30, (1993); Ko E., Kincade D.H., Product line characteristics as determinants of quick response implementation for US apparel manufacturers, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 16, pp. 11-18, (1999); A $13 billion success story: Quick response, Bobbin, 38, pp. 46-48, (1997); Lowson B., King R., Hunter A., Quick Response: Managing the Supply Chain to Meet Customer Demand, (1999); Mullinix L.H., Order management as a core competency, Supply Chain Management Review, 2, pp. 87-94, (1998); Nunnally J.C., Psychometric Theory, (1967); Phelon, Sheldon and Masar, (1999); Sheth J.N., A theory of merchandise-buying behavior, Theories of Retailing, pp. 182-190, (1981); Shim S., Drake M., Profitability of women's apparel shops: Business practices, promotions, and store/owner characteristics, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 10, pp. 68-75, (1991); Shipley D., Resellers' supplier selection criteria for different consumer products, European Journal of Marketing, 64, pp. 199-214, (1985); Triola M., Elementary Statistics, (1998); Wagner J., Ettenson R., Parrish J., Vendor selection among retail buyers: An analysis by merchandise division, Journal of Retailing, 65, pp. 58-79, (1989); Webster Jr. F.E., Wind Y., A general model for understanding organizational buyer behavior, Journal of Marketing, 36, pp. 12-19, (1972)","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","13612026","","","","English","J.

The results of this single case study demonstrate the use of marketing automation to generate high-quality sales leads through behavioral targeting and content personalization.

At present, there are 23 private insurance companies including Indian Private insurance companies and Indian private insurance companies with foreign partners in India. These companies are competing with the LIC to tap the immense insurance market potential of India. After the new economic reforms and global economic recession, the insurance companies have started to review their marketing strategies relating to assessing the customer’s financial needs and their other economic expectations, budget allocation, sales targets, staff training, adopting sophisticated technology, office automation in order to compete with their counterparts emerging in the scenario. This paper is an attempt to know the purchase decision of life insurance policyholders in the study area, which is situated in South Tamil Nadu. It is observed that among the policy holders with different age groups, the younger groups have positive attitude with insurance plans than elders. Although there has been a significant and rapid advancement in the area of customer management, there are many issues that need to be explored. Insurance companies across the world have started recognizing the value of superior customer care. © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

For all the stakeholders in the area, this is a real breakthrough, and machine learning is at the core of this revolution. It has profoundly revolutionized companies in many aspects including the evolution of communication methods, the automation of many processes, the growing importance of information systems, etc. With shrinking margins and more demanding customers, supply chain management in increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage. Its management and optimization requires a factual to Supply Chain decision making at strategique, tactical and operational levels. In this context and data rich environment, machine learning approaches and techniques find numerous useful applications for supply chain decision making. Today, companies have no choice but to apply Machine Learning solutions in almost every part of their processes. This fact seems even clearer in markets where competition is fierce. While Machine Learning does not redefine the enterprise, it is certainly a powerful asset for both marketing and process optimization purposes. It is so ingrained in the strategies of companies that now most of them rely heavily on it for all processes from creation, to product quality control, to public relations. In recent years, a series of practical applications of machine learning (ML) for supply chain decisions have been introduced. By interconnecting the ML methods applied for SC decision making, this paper identifies current SC applications and indicates potential research gaps. In this paper, we examine the general usability of machine learning techniques to assist with supply chain decisions. The main objective of this research is therefore to study how machine learning techniques can be integrated into the range of tools available to supply chain decision makers in order to take advantage of the increasing volume of data generated in the supply chain. © 2022 Authors.

However, customer insight takes many forms, arrives at the organisation from increasingly diverse sources and requires more than mere dissemination if it is to be useful. A multiple case study approach is used to explore managerial practices for insight generation and use. Multiple informants from each of four organisations in diverse sectors were interviewed. Findings reveal the importance of value alignment and value monitoring across the insight demand chain, to complement the information processing emphasis of extant research. Within the firm, the study suggests the importance of customer insight conduct practices including insight format, the role of automation and insight shepherding, to complement the much-researched process perspective. The study provides a basis for assessing the effectiveness of insight processes by both practitioners and scholars. © 2015, Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Business to business marketing; Case study; Customer insight;

Such automated decision-making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision-making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long-term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference-in-differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self-regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision-making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps. © 2023 The Authors.

A social media platform can provide marketing posts with access to a large pool of candidates and at a low cost. It also provides the opportunity to quickly customize and refine messages in response to the reception. With online marketing, the key question is: which communities are attracted by recruitment tweets on social media? In this work, we profile the Twitter accounts that interact with a set of recruitment tweets by the U.S. Army’s Recruitment Command through a network-centric perspective. By harnessing how users signal their affiliations through user information, we extract and analyze communities of social identities. From Social Identity Theory, these social identities can be critical drivers of behavior, like the decision to enlist in the military. With this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of the U.S. Army’s recruitment campaign on Twitter, observing that these campaigns typically attract communities with military exposure like veterans or those that identify with professional careers and fitness (e.g., student, professionals, athletes). The campaign also attracts, but at a much lower level, interaction from those in the digital industries—data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, and so forth. When analyzing the accounts in terms of their degree of automation, we find a set of intent-unknown bot accounts interacting with the tweets, and that many of the recruitment accounts are perceived as automated accounts. These observations can aid in campaign refinement: targeting the digital community and getting a broader reach for online recruitment publicity campaigns. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

From a backyard venture, it has made a quantum leap to emerge as a dynamic industry. Over the last three decades, there have been significant developments in the poultry industry with each decade focusing on different sectors. The seventies saw a spurt in egg production; the eighties an acceleration in broiler production; the nineties advances in poultry integration, automation and feed production. The present decade promises to exploit value added products and the global trade avenue. India is a developing country primarily has an agricultural economy. If agriculture blooms, the country prospers. Agriculture is a diversified subject covers such activities as farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery including agro- based industries in broader concept. Rural development improves the quality life of the weaker sections and gives way for participation and involvement of the masses in the process of decision making in economic and social life of and society.They provide livelihood to and million of rural house holds in the sub marginal level both land less and small landholders. They prove to be the best way to alleviate rural poverty and reduce income disparities. Industrial sector depends on agriculture for their raw material and allied products. Poultry and egg are popular food articles of high nutritional value and so and major break through have been achieved in egg production and broiler stock. This due to integrated development of breeding feeding, marketing, healthcare and nutrition etc.Poultry farming by providing additional income to the agricultures helps them to earn more and helps the nation to develop with out any wide disparities in the of income. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.","Agriculture; Egg consumption; Livelihood; Nutritional; Production; Rural","","","","","","","","Singh R.A.; Gupta P., Indian Poultry Industry Year Book-, (1998); (1998); Garaman M.R.; Pesti G.M., Reid W.M., Raising Healthy Poultry Under Primitive Conditions, (1992); Prabakaran R., Commercial Chicken Production, (1998); Sacharow S., Griffin R.C., Principles of Food Packaging, (1980); Sim S.J., Nakai S., Egg Uses and Processing Technologies, New Developments, (1994); Jain G.L., Breeding commercial chickens under tropical conditions, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Conference and Exhibition of Pune, (2001); Mandal M.K., Kandekar N., Rajak T., Backyard farming in tribal areas: Present status and future strategies, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Mani M., Viswanathn K., Cold storage of chicken eggs with food commodities, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Mehta R., WTO, liberalisation and poultry industry: The case of India, The 1st SAARC Poultry Conference, (2001); Mehta R., WTO and Indian Poultry Sector, Lessons From State Support Measures In Select Countries, (2002); Mehta R., WTO and Indian Poultry Sector, (2002); Mehta R., WTO and the Indian poultry sector, WTO and New International Trade Regime, (2003); Mehta R., Nambiar R.G., Trade reforms in the light of WTO: The case of Indian poultry industry, Special Issues of ASCI Journal of Management: On WTO and The New Trade Regime, (2002); Mehta R., Nambiar R.G., Livestock Industrialization, Trade and Social Health Environment Impact In Developing Countries: A Case Study of Indian Poultry Sector, (2002); Mehta R., Saqib M., George J., A Case Study of Select Processed Food Products In India, (2002); Procedure For Import of Livestock Products Into India, (2001); Mishra S.C., Mohanty C.K., Mishra P.K., Dehuri R.K., Present scenario of backyard poultry farming strategies for improvement: A case report, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Mohanty S., Rajendran K., 2020 vision for Indian poultry industry, International Journal of Poultry Science, 2, 2, pp. 139-143, (2003); Moore A.P.G., Perverse incentives, Institute For Research On Public Expenditure, (1997); Narahari D., Water treatment- efficient and economic methods, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Panda B.K., Singh R., Village chicken production India and its future scope, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Rai R.B., Balakrishnan P., Women and backyard poultry production in A & N Islands: Prospects and problems, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Rao B.V.,  Century, (1986); Rath M., Nayak S., Iqbaluddin, Strategies for future development of poultry industry: Policies/Strategies and constraints of poultry development in India, Paper Presented At, South Asian Regional Conference, (2001); Reddy C.V., Sustainable poultry production for poverty alleviation and human development in South Asian countries, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference and Exhibition, (2001); Sachdev A.K., Gopal R., Singh R., Estimation of input output energy use for diversified mode of poultry development, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Sathe B.S., Rao K.R., Ravindra D., Mahadevan O.K., Contract broiler farming in India key issues, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference of Exhibition, (2001); Seshaiah M.P., Sorghum grains in poultry feed, Technical and Institutional Options For Sorghum Grain Mold Management: Proceedings of and International Consultations, (2000); Sharma R.K., Banerjee A.K., Singh H., Singh C.V., Strategies for improving productivity of rural poultry production sub-system, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Sheldon B.L., Critical issues for poultry research and development in the SAARC region, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Sheokand B.S., Sustainable poultry farming and extension education, Paper Presented At South Asian Regional Poultry Conference, (2001); Shiva V., More Than a Matter of Two Flies: WHY KFC is An Ecological Issues, (1996); Soni B.K., Asian poultry scene, Indian Poultry Industry Yearbook, (1994)","S.

These approaches generally are focused on the analysis of the working activity and neglect the influence of the worker characteristics involved, strongly limiting the effectiveness of the risk-based decision making. This has a particular relevance in manufacturing field, where workers are still widely employed in several tasks, despite an increasing processes automation. Within this paper an innovative approach to explicitly consider the individual characteristic of the workers within the risk assessment in the work environment is described. Integration of a Human Performance model within risk assessment process is thus proposed. The resulting method allowed the definition of a customized risk based both on the individual skill of the worker involved and on the characteristics of the work places The comparison between risk assessed with traditional method and the customized risk showed the relevant influence that the human performance may have on the risk level to which the workers are exposed to and consequently allowed the company to identify the need for technical and organisational prevention and protection measures not highlighted with the more traditional approach. This method was applied for validation to an assembly line of a heavy vehicles manufacturing plant. The impact on the risk assessment is here shown and discussed, while the results in terms of safety at the workplace are still in the phase of data collection and will be published in future work. This model represents a step into the future of safety as a precursor of a more general process of customization at the individual level that is ongoing in several branches from the precision and personalized medicine (Duarte and Spencer, 2016) to the individual financial and marketing methods (Matz and Netzer, 2017). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Customized Risk; Human performance; Occupational safety management","Accidents; Decision making; Employment; Health hazards; Health risks; Human engineering; Industrial hygiene; Manufacture; Risk assessment; Assessment process; Customized risk; Health and safety; Human performance; Occupational safety; Occupational safety management; Risks assessments; Safety management; Work environments; Workers'; article; assembly line; controlled study; factory; human; marketing; occupational safety; personalized medicine; risk assessment; skill; work environment; worker; workplace; Occupational risks","","","","","","","Baines T.S., Benedettini O., Modelling human performance within manufacturing systems design: from a theoretical towards a practical framework, J.

This research investigates the evolutionary role of AI in transitioning from traditional marketing frameworks to data-driven methodologies, thereby enhancing marketing efficiency and customer engagement. The increasing reliance on AI for strategic decision-making in marketing underscores the significance of this study. Employing a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, this research synthesizes data from an array of studies to thoroughly understand the impact of AI on marketing. The findings reveal that AI significantly streamlines marketing operations, fosters highly personalized marketing strategies, and enhances the accuracy of forecasting market trends and consumer behavior. However, this study also sheds light on the ethical and privacy concerns associated with the use of AI in marketing. Results point towards a significant transformation in marketing practices propelled by AI, marked by improvements in operational efficiency and customer interaction. Nevertheless, the study advocates the importance of addressing ethical considerations and privacy issues, emphasizing responsible AI deployment. The study offers a comprehensive perspective on the integration of AI in marketing and suggests insights into prospective trends. It recommends a balanced approach to leveraging AI’s capabilities while upholding ethical standards. The research’s practical implications aim to guide marketers and researchers towards responsible and effective AI adoption in marketing strategies, paving the way for a future where technology enhances marketing endevaours without compromising ethical integrity. © 2024, Editorial Team of JoMW.

The analysis revealed that paddy output disposal to formal agencies improves price realisation and farmers' income by ₹3.31 per kg and ₹16518 per annum as compared to informal agencies, respectively. The choice of formal agencies was determined by several factors, namely land size, marketed surplus, awareness about MSP, education, social status, and access to technical advice.

However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor-automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Customer satisfaction;

Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence.

Facilitating real-time bidding for audience impressions and personalized targeting, programmatic technologies are at the leading edge of digital, data-driven advertising. But almost no research considers programmatic advertising within a general history of information technology in commercial media industries. The computerization of advertising and media buying remains curiously unexamined. Using archival sources, this study situates programmatic advertising within a longer trajectory, focusing on the incorporation of electronic data processing into the spot television business, starting in the 1950s. The article makes three contributions: it illustrates that (1) demands for information, data processing, and rapid communications have long been central to advertising and media buying; (2) automation “ad tech” developed gradually through efforts to coordinate and accelerate transactions; and (3) the use of computers to increase efficiency and approach mathematical optimization reformatted calculative resources for media and marketing decisions. © The Author(s) 2019.","Ad tech; advertising; audience commodity; automation; critical data studies; history of technology; new media; programmatic","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.","Admen must improve measurement justification of efforts, Jones says, Advertising Age, (1962); Computers to make media buying more marketing-oriented, 4A’s told, Advertising Age, (1962); Y&R, BBDO unleash media computerization, Advertising Age, (1962); Beer D., Envisioning the power of data analytics, Information, Communication & Society, 21, 3, pp. 465-479, (2018); Bermejo F., Audience manufacture in historical perspective: from broadcasting to Google, New Media & Society, 11, 1-2, pp. 133-154, (2009); Bogart L., Buying services and the media marketplace, Journal of Advertising Research, 40, 5, pp. 37-41, (2000); Electronic brain for timebuying, Broadcasting, pp. 31-32, (1959); Top 50 agencies … and their 1960 radio-TV billings, Broadcasting, pp. 28-29, (1960); Automation buying in pilot use at BBDO, Broadcasting, (1961); Media buying: with or without the numbers?

Health-care organizations are being encouraged to find more efficient methods of providing high-quality care with cost savings. Elderly people who live alone may fear being unable to obtain help if they are injured or ill. For many families, the fear of such an event can dominate decisions about living arrangements. During the last decades, this fear has generated an industry, marketing house automations, alarm-and-notification systems as well as assistive technologies and interventions that aim at easier and more efficient control of their living environment, as well as the provision of specialized home-care services. In this study, the most important aspects of the INHOME platform architecture, the home-care services provided together with the home-care applications developed such as health monitoring and household appliances monitoring and control, are discussed.

They argue that a growing proportion of marketing decisions can not only be supported but may also be automated. From a standpoint of both efficiency (e.g., management productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., resource allocation decisions), such automation is highly desirable. The authors describe how model-based automated decision-making is likely to penetrate various marketing decision-making environments and how such models can incorporate competitive dynamics. For example, the authors foresee that close to full automation can ultimately take place for many decisions about existing products in stable markets. Partial automation could characterize decision making for new products in stable markets and existing products in unstable markets.","Automation; Competition; Decision support","","","","","","","","Abraham M.M., Lodish L.M., PROMOTER: An Automated Promotion Evaluation System, Marketing Science, 6, SPRING, pp. 101-123, (1987); Abraham M.M., Lodish L.M., An Implemented System for Improving Promotion Productivity Using Store Scanner Data, Marketing Science, 12, SUMMER, pp. 248-269, (1993); Armstrong G., Remarks on Decision Support at Ocean Spray, Third Invitational Symposium on Choice Modeling and Behavior, (1996); Bayus B.L., High-Definition Television: Assessing Demand Forecasts for a Next Generation Consumer Durable, Management Science, 39, NOVEMBER, pp. 1319-1333, (1993); Bazerman M., Judgment in Managerial Decision Making, 3rd Edition, (1994); Blattberg R.C., Glazer R., Little J.D.C., The Marketing Information Revolution, (1994); Blattberg R.C., Hoch S.J., Database Models and Managerial Intuition: 50% Model and 50% Manager, Management Science, 36, pp. 887-899, (1990); Boulding W., Et al., Understanding Managers' Strategic Decision-Making Process, Marketing Letters, 5, OCTOBER, pp. 413-426, (1994); Bresnahan T., Testing and Measurement in Competition Models, Advances in Economics and Econometrics: Theory and Applications, (1997); Bucklin R.E., Gupta S., Commercial Adoption of Advances in the Analysis of Scanner Data, (1997); Christen M., Gupta S., Porter J.C., Staelin R., Wittink D.R., Using Market-Level Data to Understand Promotion Effects in a Nonlinear Model, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, AUGUST, pp. 322-334, (1997); Dawes R.M., Corrigan B., Linear Models in Decision Making, Psychology Bulletin, 81, FEBRUARY, pp. 95-106, (1974); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., The Persistence of Marketing Effects on Sales, Marketing Science, 14, WINTER, pp. 1-21, (1995); Dowling G.R., Kabanoff B., Computer-Aided Content Analysis: What Do 240 Advertising Slogans Have in Common, Marketing Letters, 7, JANUARY, pp. 63-76, (1996); Fader P.S., Hardie B.G.S., Modeling Consumer Choice among SKUs, Journal of Marketing Research, 33, NOVEMBER, pp. 442-452, (1996); Glazer R., Steckel J.N., Winer R.S., Locally Rational Decision Making: The Distracting Effect of Information on Managerial Performance, Management Science, 38, FEBRUARY, pp. 212-226, (1992); Gross I., The Creative Aspects of Advertising, Sloan Management Review, 14, FALL, pp. 83-109, (1972); Hoch S.J., Schkade D.A., A Psychological Approach to Decision Support Systems, Management Science, 42, JANUARY, pp. 51-64, (1996); Leeflang P.S.H., Wittink D.R., Competitive Reaction Versus Consumer Response: Do Managers Overreact?, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 13, APRIL, pp. 103-120, (1996); Little J.D.C., BRANDAID: A Marketing Mix Model, Parts 1 and 2, Operations Research, 23, JULY-AUGUST, pp. 628-673, (1975); Little J.D.C., Decision Support Systems for Marketing Managers, Journal of Marketing, SUMMER, pp. 9-26, (1979); Mason C.H., New Product Entries and Product Class Demand, Marketing Science, 9, WINTER, pp. 58-73, (1990); Mela C.F., Gupta S., Lehmann D.R., The Long-Term Impact of Promotion and Advertising on Consumer Brand Choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, MAY, pp. 248-261, (1997); Moore M.C., Urbany J.E., Blinders, Fuzzy Lenses and the Wrong Shoes: Pitfalls in Competitor Analysis, Marketing Letters, 5, JULY, pp. 247-258, (1994); Neslin S., Et al., A Research Agenda for Making Scanner Data More Useful to Managers, Marketing Letters, 5, 4, pp. 395-412, (1994); Rasmusen E., Games and Information: An Introduction to Game Theory, 2nd Edition, (1994); Rothschild W., Putting It All Together, (1979); Russo J.E., Shoemaker P.J.H., Decision Traps, (1989); Schoemaker P.S.H., Scenario Planning: A Tool for Strategic Thinking, Sloan Management Review, 36, WINTER, pp. 25-40, (1995); Schwartz P., The Art of the Long View, (1991); Pre-Test Market Evaluations of New Packaged Goods: A Model and Measurement Methodolgy, Journal of Marketing Research, 15, MAY, pp. 171-191, (1978); Silva-Risso J.M., Bucklin R.E., Morrison D.G., A Decision Support System for Planning Manufacturers' Sales Promotion Calendars, (1997); Simon H., Models of Man: Mathematical Essays on Rational Human Behavior in a Social Setting, (1957); Sultan F., Farley J.U., Lehmann D.R., A Meta-Analysis of Applications of Diffusion Models, Journal of Marketing Research, 27, FEBRUARY, pp. 70-77, (1990); Urban G.L., Hauser J.R., Roberts J.H., Prelaunch Forecasting of New Automobiles, Management Science, 36, APRIL, pp. 401-421, (1990)","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","09230645","","","","English","Mark.

Owing to the strong client base spread all over the world and the massive sales force, the organization needed to focus on a more efficient sales tracking system. Ravi Kathuria, Senior Vice president - Global Marketing & Alliances of Birlasoft was keen to align the organization's dispersed sales force through Sales Force Automation (SFA) system. In this context, SFA was expected to provide transparency and clear visibility of the sales pipeline. There was also an expectation that SFA would help in improving efficiency of global sales force in terms of reporting and customer analysis. At first, the organization decided to implement a home grown sales force automation system, which turned out be a failure, owing to both internal and external factors. This led Kathuria to explore other options which could meet their system requirements and could be implemented in shorter time frames with minimum budget. They evaluated multiple options and are debating on which system to opt for. This case examines the various software delivery methods in the decision on new software procurement. Several software and vendor parameters and the analytical structure and process for evaluating software vendors are included for consideration. This case underlines an innovation which has introduced a complete paradigm shift in information application acquisition, that is, instead of buying software as a product, organizations are increasingly procuring it as a service. Case (B) Following from Case A, the team in Birlasoft appraised multiple options and the majority of the team members were inclined towards SaaS-based SFA. This case discusses various processes and parameters considered by Birlasoft while deciding on a new software vendor. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","","","","","","","","","Morgan A., Inks S.A., Technology and the sales force, Industrial Marketing, 30, 5, pp. 463-472, (2001); Parthasarth M., Sohi R., Sales force automation and the adoption of technology innovation by sales people: Theory and implications, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 12, 3-4, pp. 196-208, (1997); Buttle F., Ang L.A., Sales force automation: Review, critique and research agenda, International Journal of Management Reviews, 8, 4, pp. 213-231, (2006); Speier C., Venkatesh V., The hidden minefields in the adoption of sales force automation technologies, Journal of Marketing, 66, 3, pp. 98-111, (2002); Othman B., Johnston Wesley J., Merunka Dwight R., The benefits of sales force automation, Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 21, 2, pp. 2137-2150, (2009); Rajendra C., Birlasoft Grows Its Sales Conversion by 3x, Express Computers, (2010); Lawrence R., Perlich C., Rosset S., Khabibrakhmanov I., Mahatma S., Weiss S., A data mining case study: Analytics-driven solutions for customer targeting and sales force allocation, The IBM Systems Journal, (2007); David A., Wheeler, Why Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS)?

The paper adopts qualitative research, based on nine in-depth interviews with key informants, to capture senior executives' experiences with implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in their organisations. The research is focused on three manufacturing industries: the automotive, food and furniture industries. The research shows that depending on the stage of the value chain, different Industry 4.0 technologies are more suitable for the support of managers' decisions. Various Industry 4.0 technologies support decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain. In the Design stage, 3D printing and scanning technologies play a crucial role. In the case of Inbound Logistics, robotisation, automation, Big Data analysis, and Business Intelligence are most useful. During the Manufacturing stage, robotisation, automation, 3D printing, scanning, Business Intelligence, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine (M2M) integration enable quick decision-making and speed up production. Sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) optimise distribution in the Outbound Logistics stage. And finally, Business Intelligence supports decisions within the Sales and Marketing stage. It is also the most versatile technology among all particular stages. The paper provides empirical evidence on the Industry 4.0 technology support in decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain, which leads to more effective value chain management, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions at each value-chain stage. When using properly selected Industry 4.0 technologies, managers can optimise their production processes, reduce costs, avoid errors and improve customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, Industry 4.0 technologies facilitate predictive analytics to forecast and anticipate future demand, quality issues, and potential risks. This knowledge allows organisations to make better decisions and take proactive actions to prevent problems.  © 2023 Michał Młody et al., published by Sciendo.","decision-making; Industry 4.0; manufacturing industry; technologies; value chain","3D printing; Customer satisfaction; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Predictive analytics; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Business-intelligence; Decision-making process; Decisions makings; Different stages; Manufacturing industries; Technology; Technology support; Value chains; Decision making","","","","","","","Abdelmajied F.Y., Industry 4.0 and Its Implications: Concept, Opportunities, and Future Dirctions, Supply Chain - Recent Advances and New Perspectives in the Industry 4.0 Era, (2022); Alvesson M., Ashcraft L.K., Interviews, Qualitative Organizational Research.

Despite the rooting of default rules in subconscious decision-making, this research finds that, ultimately, awareness drives the demand necessary for the creation of sustainable consumption. Whereas direct appeal to individuals has a disappointing level of influence on sustainability choices, it is understood that green consumers do come from somewhere. Green default rules offer interesting prospects for sidestepping the drawbacks of direct marketing to individuals. Under green default rules, behavior is guided by a default, such as utilities automatically sending customers renewables-sourced instead of fossil-fuel-based energy. To act otherwise requires additional effort and is less likely. Motivated by a need to understand how defaults might bridge standards and sustainable consumption, I investigate how organizational processes potentially lead from standardized green default rules to individual awareness that can spread and facilitate sustainable consumption. This paper examines the Active House sustainable building demonstrations in Europe in order to understand how (1) communications and market creation and (2) responsible, user-centered experimentation are organized to move from defaults to sustainable consumption. © 2018 by the authors.","Automation; Default bias; Green default rules; Smart home; Standardization; Sustainable building; Sustainable consumption","Europe; automation; consumption behavior; decision making; energy resource; fossil fuel; long-term change; market conditions; marketing; renewable resource; standardization; sustainability; technology adoption","","","","","","","Michael M., Gaver W., Home beyond home: Dwelling with threshold devices, Space Cult, 12, pp. 359-370, (2009); Shove E., Users, technologies and expectations of comfort, cleanliness and convenience, Innov.

Totally new ways of managing a business are likely, but it is not yet clear what these ways may be. In spite of the tremendous implications of these new technologies, little research is being conducted in this area. A panel session exploring this topic was thus offered at the 1984 Toronto meeting of the American Institute for Decision Sciences. This article presents the results of that session. The intent of the article is to foster research interest in this area and identify the extensive opportunities available. The article reviews the extant literature concerning the management of factory automation and identifies the gaps in our knowledge where research is needed. Factory automation as defined here is intended to include the areas of both hard automation (CAD/CAM, robotics, FMS, etc.) and soft automation (such as MRP II, group technology, MAP, data networking). Research issues are divided into three major topic areas for ease of discussion: strategic issues, justification issues, and implementation issues. The strategic area encompasses the subjects of corporate strategy and its tie with manufacturing strategy, firm characteristics of leading-edge users of automation, the effect of learning and experience with automation, the concept of ""synergy"" among automation technologies, technology transfer, and implementation strategy. The justification issues are divided into benefit, cost, and risk aspects. The present inadequacy of economic justification techniques for automation systems and the pros and cons of alternative approaches are explored. The consideration of differing types of automation and their possible need for differing justification techniques is also discussed. For both benefits and costs, the quantification problem is a major issue, particularly with benefits believed to improve the effectiveness of operations, rather than their efficiency (a major advantage of the automation technologies, it is often claimed). Another major issue here is the pre- and postautomation comparison, requiring accurate and thorough manufacturing audit techniques. The risks in automation can be tremendous. Whether this can be reduced through incremental automation, or other approaches, is a very important question. The nature of the risks-technological, financial, sociological-is also an important subject for research, as well as methods to deal with each type. Topics in the implementation area include procedural aspects, human aspects, interface/infrastructure aspects, and measurement and reward aspects. In general, the nature of the automation implementation process, and its solution, is a critical research area that is confounded with multiple factors. There is a need for research to determine if such a thing as a ""best"" implementation path exists for specific technologies and firms. How does a firm know if it is ""ready"" for automation, and which automation technology to start with? The effect of automation on workers and management is an important research question. And in addition, what are the effects of these employees on the implementation process? And it will be necessary to know how jobs change under automation, for both line and staff. Research is also needed to determine how automation will affect the way the firm does business, how interdepartmental coordination will be affected, and whether there will even be departments. If automation is implemented piecemeal, can the pieces later be tied together? What will be the problems? Managers need to know if new measurement and reward systems will be needed for workers, or perhaps even more important, for the managers. Will incentives need to be increased, or changed in some other fashion, for managers to be willing to take the risks involved in automation? Last, some advice is given to the potential researcher in this area. Approaching this subject in a way that yields meaningful research, helpful to real managers currently struggling with these problems, is important since real firms are our primary research laboratories in this field. For example, case studies, interviews, surveys, and conceptual development are important early tools in this area compared to the traditional model building and analysis techniques that have historically characterized operations management. © 1986.","","","","","","","","","Abernathy, Clark, Kantrow, The New Industrial Competition, Harvard Business Review, pp. 68-81, (1981);

This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice. Hence, this study could stimulate researchers to deepen the phenomenon and empirically validate the propositions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Cognitive computing; Data-driven decision-making; Growth hacking; International dynamic marketing capabilities; International marketing","","","","","","","","Abbott A.D., Methods of Discovery: Heuristics for the Social Sciences (Contemporary Societies), (2004); Abkenar S.B., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Jameii S.M., Big data analytics meets social media: a systematic review of techniques, open issues, and future directions, Telematics and Informatics, 57, (2021); Acosta A.S., Crespo A.H., Agudo J.C., Effect of market orientation, network capability and entrepreneurial orientation on international performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), International Business Review, 27, 6, pp. 1128-1140, (2018); Ajmal M.M., Koskinen K.U., Knowledge transfer in project-based organizations: an organizational culture perspective, Project Management Journal, 39, 1, pp. 7-15, (2008); Albaum G.S., Albaum G., Duerr E., International Marketing and Export Management, (2008); Allsop D.T., Bassett B.R., Hoskins J.A., Word-of-mouth research: principles and applications, Journal of Advertising Research, 47, 4, pp. 398-411, (2007); Alvesson M., Sandberg J., Generating research questions through problematization, Academy of Management Review, 36, 2, pp. 247-271, (2011); Argyris Y.A., Monu K., Corporate use of social media: technology affordance and external stakeholder relations, Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce, 25, 2, pp. 140-168, (2015); Asseraf Y., Lages L.F., Shoham A., Assessing the drivers and impact of international marketing agility, International Marketing Review, 36, 2, pp. 289-315, (2018); Autio E., Sapienza H.J., Comparing process and born global perspectives in the international growth of technology-based new firms, Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, pp. 413-424, (2000); Barrales-Molina V., Martinez-Lopez F.J., Gazquez-Abad J.C., Dynamic marketing capabilities: toward an integrative framework: dynamic marketing capabilities, International Journal of Management Reviews, 16, 4, pp. 397-416, (2014); Berry M.J., Linoff G.S., Data Mining Techniques: For Marketing, Sales, and Customer Relationship Management, (2004); Bertello A., Ferraris A., Bresciani S., De Bernardi P., Big data analytics (BDA) and degree of internationalization: the interplay between governance of BDA infrastructure and BDA capabilities, Journal of Management and Governance, 25, pp. 1-21, (2020); Bharadwaj A., El Sawy O.A., Pavlou P.A., Venkatraman N., Digital business strategy: toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Bloomfield B.P., Latham Y., Vurdubakis T., Bodies, technologies and action possibilities: when is an affordance?, Sociology, 44, 3, pp. 415-433, (2010); Bohnsack R., Liesner M.M., What the hack?

This decision is accompanied by much controversy among the global health community. We provide a preliminary analysis of Twitter conversations regarding the MRTP authorization of IQOS by identifying the authors, valence towards the policy decision, source of cited link, and focused topic. Methods: We analyzed 548 tweets mentioning MRTP posted between July 2016 (when PMI submitted the proposal) and October 2020. Results: We found a higher proportion of pro-MRTP valence (25.4%) than anti-MRTP (16.2%). Nearly half of the tweets (47.2%) expressing personal opinions presented pro-MRTP valence (vs. anti-MRTP = 23.9%). The FDA website was more frequently cited in pro-MRTP tweets (30.8% vs. anti = 4.8%), while tobacco control advocates’ websites were cited only in anti-MRTP tweets (77.4% vs. pro = 0). Pro-MRTP valence appeared more frequently in tweets mentioning health (53.1% vs. anti =38.5%) and cessation (100% vs. anti = 0). Nearly 42% of tweets showed a bot score greater than.43, indicating a possibility of automation. Conclusion: Continuous efforts are needed to surveil the industry’s attempts to create a climate of false consensus and circulate misinformation regarding MRTP on social media, as well as to assist non-scientific audiences’ understanding of MRTP. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","content analysis; Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Heated tobacco products; modified risk tobacco products (MRTP); Twitter","Humans; Marketing; Social Media; Tobacco; Tobacco Products; Tobacco Use; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Food and Drug Administration; human; marketing; social media; tobacco; tobacco use; United States","","","","","","","(2020); Allem J.-P., Ferrara E., Uppu S.P., Cruz T.B., Unger J.B., E-cigarette surveillance with social media data: Social bots, emerging topics, and trends, JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, 3, 4, (2017); Ayers J.W., Leas E.C., Allem J.-P., Benton A., Dredze M., Althouse B.M., Cruz T.B., Unger J.B., Why do people use electronic nicotine delivery systems (electronic cigarettes)?

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation","","","","","","","","Abijith A., Wamba S.F., Business value of RFID-enabled healthcare transformation projects, Business Process Management Journal, 19, 1, (2012); Barney J., Wright M., Ketchen D.J., The resource-based view of the firm: ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Benko A., Lanyi C.S., History of artificial intelligence, Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 1759-1762, (2009); Benner M.J., Dynamic or static capabilities?

Heuristics play a role for the integration of human decision-making models and automation in augmentation processes, particularly in marketing where automation is widespread. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes qualitative data about the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics in decision-making models, and it is based on evidence collected from interviews with twenty-two experienced marketers. Findings: Marketers make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks. While the adoption of new automatic marketing tools modify the task environment and field of use of traditional decision-making models, the adoption of heuristics rules with a different scope is essential to defining inputs, interpreting/evaluating outputs and control the marketing automation system. Originality/value: The paper makes a contribution to research on the relationship between marketing automation and decision-making models. In particular, it proposes the results of in-depth interviews with senior decision makers to assess the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics as decision-making models adopted by marketers. © 2023, Simone Guercini.","AI in marketing;

SmartFleet is a cloud-based fleet management tool that provides enterprise resource planning capability to fleet vehicle operators. For Maui and Mannix, there were numerous challenges ranging from developing a pricing strategy, growing the market as a pioneer in this industry in the Philippines, to proactively managing the potential global competitors who were on the verge of the Philippines market.

The “scope” refers to the decision-making contexts in which the use of the heuristic rules is diffuse and is effective. More precisely, “scope"" is (the extension of) the field in which a heuristic can be applied (successfully). The article is based on evidence collected through ethnographic interviews with twenty-three experienced marketers to discuss the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristic rules in decision-making. The marketers interviewed make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks as emerged from previous exploratory research. The paper discusses how the field of application of marketing experts' heuristics evolves as result of the digitalization and in particular of the use of automatic marketing systems. The adoption of the new automatic marketing tools modifies the task environment and the field of use of the traditional heuristic rules, but heuristics remain fundamental in the definition phase of the inputs for the automatic marketing systems, or for the interpretation of the output and therefore for the control of the marketing automation. The paper clarifies the concept of scope of heuristics and offers a rich description of the impact of marketing automation on scope. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adaptive toolbox; Digitalization; Ethnographic interviews; Marketers’ heuristics; Marketing automation; Scope of heuristics","","","","","","Università degli Studi di Firenze, UniFI","Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Firenze within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

It gives insight into the optimal thoroughness for user organizations to prepare themselves for the purchase of a new system. Interest in the subject stems from a contradiction found in the literature: on the one hand thorough (internal) planning and preparation of projects are recommended while on the other hand other authors state a plea for early (external) co-operation and negotiation with suppliers. Is a very thorough internal preparation a good pay-off or is it better to interact with potential suppliers after a restricted internal preparation? Results from this empirical research — which is part of a major study on marketing and purchasing of mainframe computer-systems — show that an optimum in thoroughness of internal preparation exists which is most effective regarding the quality of the project. A few important implications for user organizations are also mentioned. © 1986, Sage Publications.
