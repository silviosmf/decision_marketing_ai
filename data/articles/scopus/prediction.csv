Because classic product-diffusion models such as the Bass model consider only initial product purchases, they are ill-fitted for sales prediction for today’s technology products with a shorter life cycle and frequent repeat purchases or subscription renewals. Despite the long tradition of product diffusion research, there exists no viable model option when repeat purchases constitute a large proportion of product sales. The present study introduces a new sales growth model, termed the generalized diffusion model with repeat purchases (GDMR), to fill this void. The GDMR formulates the growth rate of sales using a noninteger-order integral equation rather than the integer-order differential equation typically adopted in existing diffusion models. The GDMR is parsimonious and easy to implement. Empirical results show that the GDMR fits sales data with varying proportions of repeat purchases quite well, making it suitable for predicting sales of a wide variety of products. In addition, the GDMR can be extended to incorporate marketing mix variables, thus enhancing its applicability in business decision making. Furthermore, using both real and simulated data, we show that the GDMR can reliably recover a product’s adoption trend using only sales data, thus cementing its theoretical validity and empirical effectiveness. Finally, we show that the GDMR is superior to generic time series and machine learning models in predicting future product sales. 2022 INFORMS.","diffusion of innovations; fractional calculus; multiunit ownerships; repeat purchases; replacements","Decision making; Differential equations; Diffusion; Forecasting; Integral equations; Learning systems; Life cycle; Diffusion model; Diffusion of innovations; Fractional calculus; Generalized diffusion; Multiunit ownership; Product sales; Products diffusions; Repeat purchase; Replacement; Technology products; Sales","","","","","","","Baesens B, Viaene S, Van den Poel D, Vanthienen J, Dedene G, Bayesian neural network learning for repeat purchase modeling in direct marketing, Eur.

However, insurance companies need to have a good profile of potential policyholders. Customer profiling has become one of the essential marketing strategies for any sustainable business, such as the insurance market, to identify potential life insurance purchasers. One well-known method of carrying out customer profiling and segmenting is machine learning. Hence, this study aims to provide a helpful framework for predicting potential life insurance policyholders using a data mining approach with different sampling methods and to lead to a transition to sustainable life insurance industry development. Various samplings, such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, Randomly Under-Sampling, and ensemble (bagging and boosting) techniques, are proposed to handle the imbalanced dataset. The result reveals that the decision tree is the best performer according to ROC and, according to balanced accuracy, F1 score, and GM comparison, Naïve Bayes seems to be the best performer. It is also found that ensemble models do not guarantee high performance in this imbalanced dataset. However, the ensembled and sampling method plays a significant role in overcoming the imbalanced problem. © 2023 by the authors.","ensemble; imbalanced data; life insurance; machine learning; sampling","data mining; insurance industry; machine learning; prediction; sampling; sustainability","","","","","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM, (GGPM-2020-016)","This research was funded by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, grant number GGPM-2020-016.","Hiwase V.A., Agrawal A.J., Review on application of data mining in life insurance, Int.

However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021","Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Electric vehicles; Support vector machines; Adoption; Imputation; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Market evolution; Methodological tools; Neural-networks; Strategic decision making; Supervised machine learning; Support vectors machine; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; prediction; statistical data; supervised classification; supervised learning; technology adoption; Forecasting","","","","","","","Bas J., Cirillo C., Cherchi E., A Stated Choice Experiment for consodering Social Conformity in the adoption of Electric Vehicles, ISCTSC 2020 - The 12th International Conference on Transport Survey Methods, (2020); Berkeley N., Bailey D., Jones A., Jarvis D., Assessing the transition towards Battery Electric Vehicles: A Multi-Level Perspective on drivers of, and barriers to, take up, Transportation Research part A: policy and practice, 106, pp. 320-332, (2017); Bezdek J.C., Hathaway R.J., VAT: a tool for visual assessment of (cluster) tendency., Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCC ’02), 3, pp. 2225-2230, (2002); Bolton R.J., Hand D.J., Statistical fraud detection: a review, Stat.

Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to “big data,” and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight—the soul—the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for “what-if” and “but-for” applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul. The brightest future is based on the synergy of what the machine can do well and what humans do well.

However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques. The main contribution of this research effort is twofold: the definition of a general-purpose BFF/Sentiment Analysis methodology and the development of a prediction model from online UGC based on the Big Five personality traits in the tourism research scenario. © 2022 Ikenga.

Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

The size of these data is impossible for traditional database and human analyst to come up with interesting information that will help in process of decision making. Management Information System (MIS) based Data warehouse (DW) and Data Mining (DM) techniques support the development of IT and process of management decision-making. But the traditional DW size make the query complex, which may cause unacceptable delay in decision support queries. Thus, in this paper an Efficient Electronic Bank MIS based DW and Mining Processing (EEBMIS-DWMP) was developed with cluster and non-cluster indexed view to provide decision-makers with both best response time and precise information. Also, analysis of the multilayer perception neural network, naïve Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and C5.0 on a real-world data of bank was done to improve effectiveness for campaign by analyzing the most useful features that influence campaign success. Results offer how the proposed EEBMIS-DWMP developed bank organizations by comparing performance of system with and without index view in terms of balance accuracy, accuracy, precision, recall, mean absolute error, root mean square error, F measure and running time.

This study is the first attempt to verify the possibility of predicting familiar and unfamiliar brand purchases based on psychophysiological reactions to a retailer television advertisement measured by EEG, EDA and eye-tracking. The number of private label products chosen later served to assess the binary dependent variable. A logistic regression model (with a prediction rate of 61.2%) was applied to determine which psychophysiological variables explained the largest part of the variance of a final purchase decision. The results show that among various measures, only the electrodermal peaks per second were significant in predicting further purchase decisions. The decision to buy was also influenced by brand familiarity. The article concludes that EDA is an unobtrusive measure of emotion-related anticipation of significant outcomes, particularly for dynamic stimuli, as related to decision-making. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.","Decision making; EDA; EEG; Eye-tracking; Marketing communication; Neuroscientific methods","","","","","","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2014/15/N/HS4/01326, 2014/15/N/HS4/01425); Narodowym Centrum Nauki, NCN","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Science Centre (2014/15/N/HS4/01425, 2014/15/N/HS4/01326).","Ambler T., Persuasion, pride and prejudice: how ads work, International Journal of Advertising, 19, 3, pp. 299-315, (2015); Ariely D., Berns G.S., Neuromarketing: The Hope and Hype of Neuroimaging in Business, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11, 4, pp. 284-292, (2010); Bakalash T., Riemer H., Exploring ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad using fMRI, Journal of Advertising, 42, 4, pp. 275-291, (2013); Benedek M., Kaernbach C., A Continuous Measure of Phasic Electrodermal Activity, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 190, 1, pp. 80-91, (2010); Bojko A., Adamczyk K., More Than Just Eye Candy: Top Ten Misconceptions About Eye Tracking, User Experience, 9, 3, pp. 4-8, (2010); Bosshard S.S., Bourke J.D., Kunaharan S., Koller M., Walla P., Established Liked Versus Disliked Brands: Brain Activity, Implicit Associations and Explicit Responses, Cogent Psychology, 3, 1, (2016); Boucsein W., Electrodermal Activity, (2012); Bradley M.M., Lang P.J., Affective Reactions to Acoustic Stimuli, Psychophysiology, 37, 2, pp. 204-215, (2000); Brown C., Randolph A.B., Burkhalter J.N., The Story of Taste: Using EEGs and Self-Reports to Understand Consumer Choice, The Kennesaw Journal of Undergraduate Research, 2, 1, (2012); Campbell M., Keller K.L., Brand Familiarity and Advertising Repetition Effects, Journal of Consumer Research, 30, 2, pp. 292-304, (2003); Cartocci G., Caratu M., Modica E., Maglione A.G., Rossi D., Cherubino P., Babiloni F., Electroencephalographic, Heart Rate, and Galvanic Skin Response Assessment for an Advertising Perception Study: Application to Antismoking Public Service Announcements, Journal of Visualized Experiments, 1, (2017); Chandon P.J., Hutchinsonyoung S., Unseen is Unsold: Assessing Visual Equity with Commercial Eye-Tracking Data, (2002); Chandon P., Hutchinson J.W., Bradlow E.T., Young S.H., Does in-store marketing work?

This paper presents a model for exploring the NB manufacturer's wholesale price decision, and the response of the SB retailer, considering consumer confusion. Consumers differ in their quality preferences for products and are classified into two groups: deliberate and confused, depending on whether they have precise quality preferences of the SB. We find that when facing a hybrid structure of consumers, the retailer will introduce the SB only when the quality preference difference between high- and low-end consumers is moderate. When the SB is offered, the retailer may not always benefit from targeting low-end consumers with the SB only; a mixed strategy by attracting low-end (high-end) consumers to the national (store) brand product can bring higher profit. Examining the effect of consumer confusion, we find that it may bring a win-win, lose-lose, or win-lose situation for the manufacturer and retailer, depending on the quality preference difference and proportion of high-end consumers. We then consider the case when being deliberate is a choice of the consumer, finding that the retailer will induce consumers to be deliberate only when the store brand quality is low. Consumer confusion will always create a win-win outcome for the manufacturer and retailer when (1) SB quality is higher than NB quality, (2) SB quality is endogenized, or (3) consumers are confused about their quality preference for both the NB and SB. The consumer surplus may be enhanced or weakened, depending on the retailer's market segmentation strategy. Our results reconcile some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical findings regarding the impacts of consumer confusion about the SB derived from lookalike packaging on a two-echelon supply chain, and our insights are robust. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Consumer confusion; Store brand; Store branded lookalike packaging; Supply chain management","competition (economics); consumption behavior; marketing; retailing; supply chain management","","","","","Co-Editor-in-Chief Tsan-Ming Choi; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71631006, 71671173, 71671175, 71731010, 71971205, 72091210/72091215)","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the Co-Editor-in-Chief Tsan-Ming Choi, the AE and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive and valuable comments.

Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Errors; Fuzzy neural networks; Marketing; Product development; Accurate prediction; Business product development; Business products; Chatbots; Increasing production; Information loss; Marketing information; Neural network model; Performance; Product information; Neural network models","","","","","Guangxi 14th Five-Year Education Science Planning Project, (,2021A033, 2021ZJY1607, 2021ZJY1612, 2022ZJY1699.2022, 2022ZJY354); Guangxi Graduate Education, (JGY2022122); Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China, (21BGL129); Rural Agriculture, Culture and Tourism for Rural Revitalization, (22FGL024); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710038); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, (2020AC19034); Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents","Funding text 1: This work was sponsored by the following funds: ""Research on Multidimensional Identification and Long-term Governance Mechanism of Relative Poverty of Farming Households in Border Areas"" (Grant No. 20BGL247), General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China under the ""Two Mountains"" Theory, General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21BGL129); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation：A study on the mechanism of physician engagement behaviour in online medical communities from the perspective of network effects (No.2022M710038).

Design/methodology/approach: The random survival forest approach is introduced to the real estate market. The most important predictors of time on market are revealed and it is analyzed how the survival probability of residential rental apartments responds to these major characteristics. Findings: Results show that price, living area, construction year, year of listing and the distances to the next hairdresser, bakery and city center have the greatest impact on the marketing time of residential apartments. The time on market for an apartment in Munich is lowest at a price of 750 € per month, an area of 60 m2, built in 1985 and is in a range of 200–400 meters from the important amenities. Practical implications: The findings might be interesting for private and institutional investors to derive real estate investment decisions and implications for portfolio management strategies and ultimately to minimize cash-flow failure. Originality/value: Although machine learning algorithms have been applied frequently on the real estate market for the analysis of prices, its application for examining time on market is completely novel. This is the first paper to apply a machine learning approach to survival analysis on the real estate market. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision tree; Housing; Machine learning; Random forest; Residential; Time on market","","","","","","","","Ahlfeldt G.M., Wendland N., The micro-cosmos of German cities: new insights into the supply of and demand for urban amenities, Understanding German Real Estate Markets, pp. 79-88, (2017); Antipov E.A., Pokryshevskaya E.B., Mass appraisal of residential apartments: an application of random forest for valuation and a CART-based approach for model diagnostics, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 2, pp. 1772-1778, (2012); Benefield J.D., Hardin W.G., Does time-on-market measurement matter?, The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 50, 1, pp. 52-73, (2015); Borst R.A., Artificial neural networks in mass appraisal, Journal of Property Tax Assessment and Administration, 1, 2, pp. 5-15, (1995); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Cajias M., Freudenreich P., Exploring the determinants of liquidity with big data–market heterogeneity in German markets, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 36, 1, pp. 3-18, (2018); Cajias M., Freudenreich P., Freudenreich A., Exploring the determinants of real estate liquidity from an alternative perspective: censored quantile regression in real estate research, Journal of Business Economics, 90, 7, pp. 1057-1086, (2020); Ceh M., Kilibarda M., Lisec A., Bajat B., Estimating the performance of random forest versus multiple regression for predicting prices of the apartments, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 7, 5, (2018); Cetin S., Ulgen A., Dede I., Li W., On fair performance comparison between Random Survival Forest and Cox regression: an example of colorectal cancer study, SciMedicine Journal, 3, 5, pp. 66-76, (2021); Cirman A., Pahor M., Verbic M., Determinants of time on the market in a thin real estate market, Engineering Economics, 26, 1, pp. 4-11, (2015); Cox D.R., Regression models and life-tables, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological), 34, 2, pp. 187-220, (1972); Dimopoulos T., Tyralis H., Bakas N.P., Hadjimitsis D., Accuracy measurement of random forests and linear regression for mass appraisal models that estimate the prices of residential apartments in Nicosia, Cyprus, Advances in Geosciences, 45, pp. 377-382, (2018); Do A.Q., Grudnitski G.A., A neural network approach to residential property appraisal, The Real Estate Appraiser, 58, 3, pp. 38-45, (1992); Fan G.Z., Ong S.E., Koh H.C., Determinants of house price: a decision tree approach, Urban Studies, 43, 12, pp. 2301-2315, (2006); Gabrielli L., Ruggeri A.G., Scarpa M., Location, location, location': fluctuations in real estate market values after COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine based on econometric and spatial analysis, random forest, and multivariate regression, Land, 12, 6, (2023); Gao G., Bao Z., Cao J., Qin A.K., Sellis T., Location-centered house price prediction: a multi-task learning approach, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 13, 2, pp. 1-25, (2022); Grobel S., Analysis of spatial variance clustering in the hedonic modeling of housing prices, Journal of Property Research, 36, 1, pp. 1-26, (2019); Harrell F., Califf R., Pryor D., Lee K., Rosati R., Evaluating the yield of medical tests, Journal of the American Medical Association, 247, 18, pp. 2543-2546, (1982); Hoeberichts M., van Rooij M., Siegmann A., House list prices and durations in boom and bust, (2013); Ishwaran H., Kogalur U.B., Blackstone E.H., Lauer M.S., Random survival forests, The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2, 3, pp. 841-860, (2008); Jaen R.D., Data mining: an empirical application in real estate valuation, Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, 2002, pp. 314-317, (2002); Kluger B.D., Miller N.G., Measuring residential real estate liquidity, Real Estate Economics, 18, 2, pp. 145-159, (1990); Kok N., Koponen E.L., Martinez-Barbosa C.A., Big data in real estate?

Game revenue forecast is vital to game developers to make the right business decisions, such as determining the marketing budget, controlling the development cost, and setting up benchmarks for evaluating game publishing performance. How to make the revenue forecast and integrate it with the game publishing process is hard for small and medium-sized independent (indie) game developers. This includes all steps of the process, from forecasting to decision-making based on the results. This paper provides a data-driven method that uses the mobile game revenue forecast based on different time-series prediction models to drive the game publishing. We demonstrate how to use the data-driven method to guide an indie game studio to forecast revenue and then set the revenue forecast as the internal benchmark to drive game publishing. In practice, we involve a real game project from an indie game studio and provide guidance for one of their casual game projects. Then, based on the revenue forecast, we discuss how to set the revenue forecast as an internal benchmark and drive the actions for mobile game publishing. Finally, we make a conclusion on how our data-driven method can be used to drive mobile game publishing and also discuss future research work. © 2021, The Author(s).","Benchmark; Business Intelligence; Game analytics; Game metrics; Game publishing; Indie game developer; Time-series prediction","Benchmarking; Decision making; Digital storage; Forecasting; Software as a service (SaaS); Studios; Time series; Benchmark; Business-intelligence; Data-driven methods; Game analytic; Game metrics; Game publishing; Indie game developer; Mobile games; Revenue forecasts; Time series prediction; Budget control","","","","","Game Hub Scandinavia 2.0, (NYPS 20201849); Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak; University of Sk?vde, Sweden Game Arena; University of Skövde, Sweden Game Arena","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the University of Skövde, Sweden Game Arena and the Game Hub Scandinavia 2.0 (NYPS 20201849) project under the EU regional development fund Interreg Öresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak. ; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the University of Sk?vde, Sweden Game Arena and the Game Hub Scandinavia 2.0 (NYPS 20201849) project under the EU regional development fund Interreg ?resund-Kattegat-Skagerrak.","Thibault C., Game Data Analysis-Tools and Methods, (2013); (2020); Guevara-Villalobos V., Cultures of independent game production: Examining the relationship between community and labor, Proceedings of the 2011 Digital Games Research Association Conference, Think Design Play.

Timely prediction of yield is crucial for labor management and marketing decision-making. This study demonstrates the use of high-resolution ground-based imagery, in addition to previous yield and weather information, for yield prediction throughout the season at different intervals (3-4 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks preharvest). Flower and fruit counts, yield, and high-resolution imagery data were collected 31 times for two cultivars (‘Florida Radiance’ and ‘Florida Beauty’) throughout the growing season. Orthorectified mosaics and digital surface models were created to extract canopy size variables (canopy area, average canopy height, canopy height standard deviation, and canopy volume) and visually count flower and fruit number. Data collected at the plot level (6 plots per cultivar, 24 plants per plot) were used to develop prediction models. Using image-based counts and canopy variables, flower and fruit counts were predicted with percentage prediction errors of 26.3% and 25.7%, respectively. Furthermore, by adding image-derived variables to the models, the accuracy of predicting out-of-sample yields at different time intervals was increased by 10-29% compared to those models without image-derived variables. These results suggest that close-range high-resolution images can contribute to yield prediction and could assist the industry with decision making by changing growers’ prediction practices. © 2021 by the authors.","Canopy size metrics; Fragaria x ananassa; High-resolution; Image analysis; Regression model","","","","","","Florida Strawberry Research and Education Foundation","Funding: This study was supported by a grant from the Florida Strawberry Research and Education Foundation (FSREF).","Sanz C., Perez A.G., Olias R., Olias J.M., Quality of Strawberries Packed with Perforated Polypropylene, J.

Instead of having managers to decide on the campaign rules, such as, when, how and whom to offer, creating intelligent campaign management systems that can automate such decisions is essential. In addition, regulations or company policies usually restrict the number of accesses to the customers. Efficient learning of customer behaviour through dynamic campaign participation observations becomes a crucial feature that may ultimately define customer satisfaction and retention. This paper builds on the recent successes of deep learning techniques and proposes a classification model to predict customer responses for campaigns. Classic deep neural networks are good at learning hidden relations within data (i.e., patterns) but with limited capability for memorization. One solution to increase memorization is to use manually craft features, as in Wide & Deep networks, which are originally proposed for Google Play App. recommendations. We advocate using decision trees as an easier way of mining high-level relationships for enhancing Wide & Deep networks. Such an approach has the added benefit of beating manually created rules, which, most of the time, use incomplete data and have biases. A set of comprehensive experiments on campaign participation data from a leading GSM provider shows that automatically crafted features make a significant increase in the accuracy and outperform Deep and Wide & Deep models with manually crafted features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree classification; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Real-time marketing; Wide & Deep network models","Customer satisfaction; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Global system for mobile communications; Learning systems; Real time systems; Sales; Campaign managements; Classification models; Customer behaviour; Customer interaction; Customer response; Efficient learning; Learning techniques; Participation prediction; Deep learning","","","","","","","Akcura M.T., Srinivasan K., Research note: Customer intimacy and cross-selling strategy, Manag.

Whereas, the sheer volume of online reviews makes it hard for consumers, especially the older adults who perceive more difficulties in reading reviews and obtaining information compared to younger adults, to locate the useful ones. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective method to locate valuable reviews of mobile phones for older adults. Besides, the authors also want to explore what characteristics of the technology older adults prefer. This will benefit both e-retailers and e-commerce platforms. Design/methodology/approach: After collecting online reviews related to mobile phones designed for older adults from a popular Chinese e-commerce platform (JD Mall), topic modeling, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) methods were applied to extract latent topics and uncover potential dimensions that consumers frequently referred to in their reviews. According to consumers' attitudes towards different popular topics, seven machine learning models were employed to predict the usefulness and popularity of online reviews due to their excellent performance in prediction. To improve the performance, a weighted model based on the two best-performing models was built and evaluated. Findings: Based on the TF-IDF, topic modeling, and LIWC methods, the authors find that older adults are more interested in the exterior, sound, and communication functions of mobile phones. Besides, the weighted model (Random Forest: Decision Tree = 2:1) is the best model for predicting the online review popularity, while random forest performs best in predicting the perceived usefulness of online reviews. Practical implications: This study’s findings can help e-commerce platforms and merchants identify the needs of the targeted consumers, predict reviews that will get more attention, and provide some early responses to some questions. Originality/value: The results propose that older adults pay more attention to the mobile phones' exterior, sound, and communication function, guiding future research. Besides, this paper also enriches the current studies related to making predictions based on the information contained in the online reviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-marketing; Information management;

Effective variable selection (VS) can increase the prediction accuracy as well as identify important users or items in CF as well as target marketing. Therefore, we propose two new VS approaches: a Pearson correlation-based approach and a forward random forests regression-based approach, comparing the performance in a variety of experimental settings. The experimental results show that the proposed VS approaches outperform the conventional approaches in the examples. Furthermore, the experimental results are more reasonable and informative than the previous experimental results because the binary misclassification error and Top-N accuracy for the user CF, the item CF, the user modeling, and the item modeling are all considered in this paper. © 2018 The Authors.

This research makes novel predictions about the time-of-day effects on (un)healthy product purchases based on self-control theory. We investigated whether and how time of day (morning vs. evening) influences consumers’ (un)healthy product purchases. A field study based on point-of-sales data indicated that consumers tend to buy more unhealthy products in the evening. Two laboratory experiments confirmed that this is due to a decrease in self-control in the evening, which leads consumers to purchase more unhealthy products at this time. A follow-up eye-tracking experiment further revealed potential mechanisms whereby lower self-control causes consumers to focus more on unhealthy products and weakens the effect of attention to healthy products on purchases. The findings provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and marketing decisions for marketing academics, retailers and consumer marketing companies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Eye-tracking; Purchase decision; Self-control; Synchrony effect; User-generated behavior","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16H02034, 17K18152); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71832001, 71902023, 71972035)","We thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful reviews and constructive suggestions during the review process.

In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference. The strong empirical evidence indicates that the big e-commerce consumer data facilitates more specialized market psychographic segmentation, which advances data-driven marketing decision-making. © The Author(s) 2019.","Amazon; big data-driven marketing; consumer preference prediction; lifestyles segmentation; personality; recommender system; text mining","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71271099, 71571084); China Scholarship Council, CSC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71571084, No. 71271099) and China Scholarship Council.

This article proposes customer churn prediction models for a SaaS inventory management company in Thailand. The main focus of this work is seeking the most suitable customer churn prediction model for this case-study SaaS inventory management company which is currently having a high churn rate issue. This paper explores four machine learning algorithms, which are logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree (DT) and random forest. The results show that the optimised DT model is capable of outperforming other classification models toward recall scorer with validated testing scores of 94.4% of recall and 88.2% of F1-score. Moreover, feature importance scores are investigated for practical insights to identify features that are significantly related to churn behaviour. Therefore, the findings can help the case-study company indicate customers who are going to churn more precisely and enhance the effectiveness of managerial decisions and effective marketing movement.

In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","LAI; Machine learning; NDVI; NDWI; Satellite remote sensing; Vineyard yield","","","","","","","","Afghanistan Central Statistics Organization, Centeral statistics organization of Afghanistan's statistical yearbook of 2018-2019, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan National Statistics and Information Authority, Kabul Afghanistan, 41, (2019); Aich V., Akhundzadah N.A., Knuerr A., Khoshbeen A.J., Hattermann F., Paeth H., Scanlon A., Paton E.N., Climate change in Afghanistan deduced from reanalysis and coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (cordex)—south Asia simulations, J.

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical research framework was developed by synthesising the past literature on masstige marketing and brand extension. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire from 396 respondents availing M-Wallet. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the brand revitalization attributes; further, the binary logistic regression model examined the effect of revitalization attributes on the chance of increasing customer's perception of masstige. Findings: The exploratory study suggested brand image, service quality and value for money pricing as essential attributes to revitalize mass brands into masstige brands; furthermore, path analysis validated the positive effects of these attributes on the perception of masstige. The proposed binary logistic regression model suggested brand image as sensitive attributes, increasing the odds ratio by 9.39 times in favour of perceiving brand as masstige followed by the perceived service quality that is 5.87 times. The prediction capability of the proposed binary logistic regression model is found to be 96%. Practical implications: The methodology of this study provides the basis for future researchers to advance research on masstige. This study will assist the marketers of mass brands to make better marketing decisions related to how masstige image can be sustained or a new or less known brand can be revitalized into a prestigious brand. Originality/value: This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of how the mass brand can be revitalised as masstige brands by considering image, quality and price attributes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand revitalization; Image; Logistic regression; Masstige; Mobile payment system; Price; Service quality; Up-scale line extension","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Building brands without mass media, Harvard Business Review, 1-2, pp. 135-141, (1997); Aaker D.A., Keller K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 27-41, (1990); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Arbore A., Soscia I., Bagozzi R., The role of signaling identity in the adoption of personal technologies, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 15, 2, pp. 86-110, (2014); Baber R., Upadhyay Y., Singh Kaurav R.P., Baber P., Application of ‘masstige’ theory and approaches for the marketing of smartphone brands in India, International Journal of Business and Emerging Markets, 12, 3, pp. 296-312, (2020); Baek T.H., Kim J., Yu J.H., The differential roles of brand credibility and brand prestige in consumer brand choice, Psychology and Marketing, 27, 7, pp. 662-678, (2010); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Bakri M., Krisjanous J., Richard J.E., Decoding service brand image through user-generated images, Journal of Services Marketing, 34, 4, pp. 429-442, (2020); Balabanis G., Stathopoulou A., The price of social status desire and public self-consciousness in luxury consumption, Journal of Business Research, 123, pp. 463-475, (2021); Barnier V., Falcy S., Valette-Florence P., Do consumers perceive three levels of luxury?

By integrating multiple data sources (i.e., practitioner literature, research literature, and expert opinions), we suggest three trends constituting opportunities and challenges (AI applications in different business sectors, primary AI functions, emerging AI topics), three possible themes of change (adoption and acceptance, operations management, AI in marketing), as well as four directions for future research (AI interaction, AI and organizational decision making, organizational implications, and managerial issues). Our findings present a detailed picture of AI development and applications along with predictions regarding its place in the industry. Finally, we outline a research agenda that addresses key issues for stakeholders in hospitality and tourism: individuals, including customers and employees; organizations and businesses; and public policymakers and governments. © The Author(s) 2024.","artificial intelligence;

Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States","Purpose: Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy.

Both Multiple Criteria Decision Aid and Statistical Learning fields offer methodologies to represent the preference of the decision maker facing the sorting problem, however, there are differences in terminology, objectives, key assumptions, and solution philosophies. In this context, this paper aims to explain these differences as well as similarities and connections between these two fields by reviewing exemplary methodologies in sorting problems. As we discuss, there are significant research opportunities for developing new methodologies by exploiting the strong aspects of these two fields. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","multiple criteria decision aid; ordinal classification; ordinal regression; preference learning; sorting; statistical learning","","","","","","","","Almeida-Dias J., Figueira J.R., Roy B., Electre Tri-C: A multiple criteria sorting method based on characteristic reference actions, European Journal of Operational Research, 204, 3, pp. 565-580, (2010); Angilella S., Greco S., Matarazzo B., Non-additive robust ordinal regression: A multiple criteria decision model based on the Choquet integral, European Journal of Operational Research, 201, 1, pp. 277-288, (2010); Aremu O.O., Hyland-Wood D., McAree P.R., A machine learning approach to circumventing the curse of dimensionality in discontinuous time series machine data, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 195, (2020); Berget I., Naes T., Optimal sorting of raw materials, based on the predicted end-product quality, Quality Engineering, 14, 3, pp. 459-478, (2002); Brajard J., Carrassi A., Bocquet M., Bertino L., Combining data assimilation and machine learning to emulate a dynamical model from sparse and noisy observations: A case study with the Lorenz 96 model, Journal of Computational Science, 44, (2020); Breiman L., Random forest, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 2-35, (2001); Breiman L., Friedman J.H., Olshen R.A., Stone C.J., Classification and regression trees, (1984); Bugdaci A.G., Koksalan M., Ozpeynirci S., Serin Y., An interactive probabilistic approach to multi-criteria sorting, IIE Transactions, 45, pp. 1048-1058, (2013); Celik B., Karasakal E., Iyigun C., A probabilistic multiple criteria sorting approach based on distance functions, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 7, pp. 3610-3618, (2015); Cheng J., Wang Z., Pollastri G., A neural network approach to ordinal regression, IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1279-1284, (2008); Cheng X., Lu J., Feng J., Yuan B., Zhou J., Scene recognition with objectness, Pattern Recognition, 74, pp. 474-487, (2018); Chu W., Ghahramani Z., Gaussian processes for ordinal regression Zoubin Ghahramani, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 6, pp. 1019-1041, (2005); Chu W., Keerthi S.S., Support vector ordinal regression, Neural Computation, 19, 3, pp. 792-815, (2007); Corrente S., Doumpos M., Greco S., Slowinski R., Zopounidis C., Multiple criteria hierarchy process for sorting problems based on ordinal regression with additive value functions, Annals of Operations Research, 251, 1-2, pp. 117-139, (2017); Corrente S., Greco S., Kadzinski M., Slowinski R., Robust ordinal regression in preference learning and ranking, Machine Learning, 93, pp. 381-422, (2013); Corrente S., Greco S., Slowinski R., Multiple criteria hierarchy process in robust ordinal regression, Decision Support Systems, 53, 3, pp. 660-674, (2012); Deng W.Y., Zheng Q.H., Lian S., Chen L., Wang X., Ordinal extreme learning machine, Neurocomputing, 74, 1-3, pp. 447-456, (2010); Devaud J.M., Groussaud G., Jaquet-Lagreze E., UTADIS: Une méthode de construction de fonctions d'utilité additives rendant compte de jugements globaux.

However, despite its prominence as an area for study, several significant challenges must be addressed. One significant challenge involves identifying, assessing and recommending social media influencers (SMIs). This study proposes a semantic network model capable of measuring an influencer's performance on specific topics or subjects to address this issue. This study can assist managers in identifying suitable SMIs based on their estimated reach. Design/methodology/approach: Data from popular YouTube influencers and publicly available performance measures (views and likes) are extracted. Second, the titles of the past videos made by the influencer are used to develop a semantic network connecting all the videos to other videos based on similarity measures. Third, the nearest neighbor approach extracts the neighbors of the target title video. Finally, based on the set of neighbors, a range prediction is made for the views and likes of the target video with the influencer. Findings: The results show that the model can predict an accurate range of views and likes based on the suggested video titles and the content creator, with 69–78% accuracy across different influencers on YouTube. Research limitations/implications: The current study introduces a novel and innovative approach that exploits the textual association between a SMI's previous content to forecast the outcome of their future content. Although the findings are encouraging, this research recognizes various constraints that upcoming researchers may tackle. Forecasting views of posts concerning novel subjects and precisely adjusting video view counts based on their age constitute two primary limitations of this study. Practical implications: Managers interested in hiring influencers can employ the suggested approach to evaluate an influencer's potential performance on a specific topic. This research aids managers in making informed decisions regarding influencer selection, utilizing data-based metrics that are simple to comprehend and explain. Originality/value: The study contributes to outreach evaluation and better estimating the impact of SMIs using a novel semantic network approach. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Influencer marketing; Network analytics; Prediction model; Semantic network; Social media influencers","","","","","","","","Abhishek, Srivastava M., Mapping the influence of influencer marketing: a bibliometric analysis, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 39, 7, pp. 979-1003, (2021); Arora A., Bansal S., Kandpal C., Aswani R., Dwivedi Y., Measuring social media influencer index- insights from facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101, (2019); Bartl M., YouTube channels, uploads and views: a statistical analysis of the past 10 years, Convergence, 24, 1, pp. 16-32, (2018); Bai L., Yan X., Yu G., Impact of consumer engagement on firm performance, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 38, 7, pp. 847-861, (2020); Barbier G., Liu H., Data mining in social media, Social Network Data Analytics, pp. 327-352, (2011); Bastrygina T., Lim W.M., Foundations of consumer engagement with social media influencers, International Journal of Web Based Communities, 19, 2-3, pp. 222-242, (2023); Boegershausen J., Datta H., Borah A., Stephen A.T., Fields of gold: scraping web data for marketing insights, Journal of Marketing, 86, 5, pp. 1-20, (2022); Borghol Y., Ardon S., Carlsson N., Eager D., Mahanti A., The untold story of the clones: content-agnostic factors that impact YouTube video popularity, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 12, pp. 1186-1194, (2012); Borgida A., Sowa J.F., Principles of semantic networks: explorations in the representation of knowledge, (1991); Bu Y., Parkinson J., Thaichon P., Influencer marketing: homophily, customer value co-creation behaviour and purchase intention, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 66, (2022); Bullinaria J.A., Levy J.P., Extracting semantic representations from word co-occurrence statistics: stop-lists, stemming, and SVD, Behavior Research Methods, 44, 3, pp. 890-907, (2012); Choudhury M., Chatterjee D., Mukherjee A., Global topology of word co-occurrence networks: beyond the two-regime power-law, Coling 2010: Posters, (2010); Chae I., Stephen A.T., Bart Y., Yao D., Spillover effects in seeded word-of-mouth marketing campaigns, Marketing Science, 36, 1, pp. 89-104, (2016); Chen T.Y., Yeh T.L., Huang Y.W., The influence of self-disclosure micro-celebrity endorsement on subsequent brand attachment: from an emotional connection perspective (Second revised version), Service Industries Journal, pp. 1-28, (2023); Covington P., Adams J., Deep neural networks for YouTube recommendations, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, (2016); Dagan I., Marcus S., Markovitch S., Contextual word similarity and estimation from sparse data, 31st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 164-171, (1993); Davidson J., Liebald B., Liu J., Nandy P., Van Vleet T., The YouTube video recommendation system, RecSys’10 - Proceedings of the 4th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 293-296, (2010); De Veirman M., Cauberghe V., Hudders L., Marketing through Instagram influencers: the impact of number of followers and product divergence on brand attitude, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 5, pp. 798-828, (2017); Diesner J., Carley K.M., AutoMap 1.2: extract, analyze, represent, and compare mental models from texts, (2004); Ehlers K., The inside Story of Papa John's Toxic Culture, (2022); Figueiredo F., Almeida J.M., Benevenuto F., Gummadi K.P., Does content determine information popularity in social media?: a case study of youtube videos' content and their popularity, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 979-982, (2014); Freberg K., Graham K., McGaughey K., Freberg L.A., Who are the social media influencers?

However, because of the growing concern over user privacy, effectively and accurately delivering advertising to promote repurchasing has become more difficult. Here, we propose an effective framework based on machine learning to model the air traveler repurchasing and furthermore employ a field experiment to test the utility of a model framework. Specifically, we collected that this model framework is based on the random forest algorithm and compared with the conclusions of the other four algorithms, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and ExtraTree algorithms. The results show that the proposed model framework is better than the prediction results of the other algorithms. In addition, the proposed model framework was verified through a real case of an airline in China. This study will serve as a guide to analyze the repurchase behaviors of an air traveler and help airlines build a loyal air traveler base. © 2022 Zhenyuan Zhang et al.","","Air transportation; Marketing;

RPGs constitute a very popular genre of computer-based games that, along with a player's gaming actions, focus on the development of the player's in-game virtual character through a persistent exploration of the gaming environment. Most RPGs follow the freemium business model in which the gamers can play for free but they are charged for premium add-on amenities. As with other freemium products, RPGs suffer from the curse of high dropout rates. This makes retention analysis extremely important for successful operation and survival of their gaming portals. Here, we develop a disciplined statistical framework for retention analysis by modelling multiple in-game player characteristics along with the dropout probabilities. We capture players’ motivations through engagement times, collaboration and achievement score at each level of the game, and jointly model them using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm) framework that further includes a time-to-event variable corresponding to churn. We capture the interdependencies in a player's level-wise engagement, collaboration, achievement with dropout through a shared parameter model. We illustrate interesting changes in player behaviours as the gaming level progresses. The parameters in our joint model were estimated by a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm which incorporated a divide-and-recombine approach for increased scalability in glmm estimation that was needed to accommodate our large longitudinal gaming data-set. By incorporating the level-wise changes in a player's motivations and using them for dropout rate prediction, our method greatly improves on state-of-the-art retention models. Based on data from a popular action based RPG, we demonstrate the competitive optimality of our proposed joint modelling approach by exhibiting its improved predictive performance over competitors. In particular, we outperform aggregate statistics based methods that ignore level-wise progressions as well as progression tracking non-joint model such as the Cox proportional hazards model. We also display improved predictions of popular marketing retention statistics and discuss how they can be used in managerial decision making. © 2021 Royal Statistical Society","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMS‐1811866, DMS‐2015250)","The research was supported by NSF DMS‐1811866 and NSF DMS‐2015250 grants.","Appel G., Libai B., Muller E., Shachar R., On the monetization of mobile apps, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 37, 1, pp. 93-107, (2020);

However, it raises serious privacy concerns since the learning process may reveal sensitive information in the profiles. It is highly desirable to provide high-quality advertisement recommendations while respecting an individual's privacy. To address the privacy issues, we propose a practical privacy-preserving system that predicts advertisement Click Through Rate (CTR) accurately without revealing any sensitive information of individuals. Our system combines both offline and online training to achieve the goal. In the offline training phase, we develop two differentially private algorithms built upon Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) algorithms, respectively, to transform features and train a privacy-preserving offline model. In the online training phase, we propose a privacy-preserving online learning algorithm to compensate for the decline of offline performance when online feature changes occur. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our system based on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our system can protect user privacy without compromising the accuracy of CTR prediction, with reasonable computation overhead. © 2021","Data perturbation; Differential privacy;

Data collected from 757 respondents were analyzed. The results indicate that our integrated framework demonstrates a favorable level of prediction power for guests’ behavior, which verified the superiority of the suggested framework. Furthermore, its findings from fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis indicate that: (a) attitude toward green hotels, perceived behavioral control, sense of obligation, and corporate image are key drivers of guests’ intentions to visit green hotels; (b) three distinct configurations of guests’ intention drivers are likely to result in a high degree of intentions among customers to visit green hotels. The three solutions all contain the conditions of high attitude, corporate image, biospheric value, and green activities, which means that these conditions are vital components of a high intention among customers to visit green hotels. This study contributes to the growing literature on sustainability in marketing and practice by providing useful insights about the determinants of guests’ behavior to use green hotels in the Egyptian hospitality context. It is one of the first empirical studies examining factors affecting guests’ behavior to use green hotels in the Egyptian hospitality context. © The Author(s) 2020.","corporate image; fsQCA; Green hotels; structural equation modelling; theory of planned behavior; value-belief-norm theory","","","","","","United Arab Emirates University, UAEU, (31B106-UPAR)","The authors sincerely thank the editor, the associate editor and the anonymous Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research’s reviewers for their constructive and valuable comments and suggestions.

Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-Tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-Task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Our work has been implemented and deployed in many online games released from NetEase Games. Online A/B testing in production shows that perCLTV achieves a prominent improvement in two precision marketing applications of popup recommendation and churn intervention. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.","churn prediction; multi-Task learning; online games; payment prediction; Personalized customer lifetime value","Commerce; Computer games; E-learning; Learning systems; Sales; Social networking (online); Value engineering; Churn predictions; Customer lifetime value; General systems; Multitask learning; On-line games; One-time; Payment prediction; Personalizations; Personalized customer lifetime value; Value prediction; Forecasting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72101176)","This study was partially funded by the supports of National Natural Science Foundation of China (72101176).

One possibility is that VR has stronger impact on mental imagery than traditional channels, creating vivid simulations of what it would be like to visit destinations. This process might create hedonic expectations of future happiness, which should increase the willingness to actually seek out the destination in real life. The results from a laboratory experiment provided support to this hypothesis. Participants were randomly assigned to view a nature destination either in traditional still images or virtual reality, and then reported their initial responses before making an actual consumer choice. VR exposure led to higher levels of mental imagery and happiness predictions, which in turn was associated with stronger travel intentions and purchasing decisions. However, VR effects on consumer choice were moderated by previous experience with the destination. © 2021 The Authors","Affective forecasting; Behavioral intentions; Mental imagery; Purchase; Telepresence; Virtual reality","consumption behavior; forecasting method; image analysis; tourism management; tourism market; tourist destination; travel behavior; virtual reality","","","","","","","Bagozzi R.P., Belanche D., Casalo L.V., Flavian C., The role of anticipated emotions in purchase intentions, Psychology and Marketing, 33, 8, pp. 629-645, (2016); Beck J., Rainoldi M., Egger R., Et al., Virtual reality in tourism: a state-of-the-art review, Tourism Review, 74, 3, pp. 586-612, (2019); Bogicevic V., Seo S., Kandampully J.A., Liu S.Q., Rudd N.A., Virtual reality presence as a preamble of tourism experience: The role of mental imagery, Tourism Management, 74, pp. 55-64, (2019); Brakus J.J., Schmitt B.H., Zarantonello L., Brand experience: What is it?

Various departments within transportation companies, including marketing, production, distribution, and finance departments, heavily rely on accurate demand forecasts to make informed decisions. Forecasting demand is a crucial aspect of managing business processes, and the methods for doing this can vary across different industries. The ultimate goal remains consistent—to obtain precise predictions of future demand by analyzing historical data and current environmental factors. In the context of transportation services, accurate demand forecasting is essential for successful operational planning and management of functional areas such as transportation operations, marketing, and finance. The current case study specifically examines the National Company Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ), a transport and logistics holding engaged in rail transportation in Kazakhstan. KTZ’s main sources of income are related to freight transportation. The volume of cargo transportation (in tons) and the freight turnover play a significant role in assessing demand and forecasting future revenues from freight traffic. Different techniques for demand forecasting are explored, including qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods rely on judgments and opinions, while quantitative methods utilize historical data or identify causal relationships between variables. Overall, the present study highlights the critical role of demand forecasting in the railway freight transportation industry and its impact on efficient planning and decision-making processes. © 2023 Silesian University of Technology.

Thus, attention trajectories, as reflected in eye movements, predict the final brand choice of 85% of consumers before they implement it. Even when observing eye movements in only the first quarter of the decision process, attention already predicts brand choice much better (45%) than chance levels (20%). This superior prediction performance is due to a “double attention lift” for the chosen brand: The chosen brand receives progressively more attention toward the moment of choice, and more of this attention is devoted to integrating information about the brand rather than to comparing it with other options. In contrast, the currently owned brand grabs attention early in the task, and its attention gain persists for brand-loyal consumers and shifts for brand-switching consumers. A new attention and choice model used in tandem with the Bayesian K-fold cross-validation methodology on eye-tracking data from 325 representative consumers uncovered these attention trajectory effects. The findings contribute to closing important knowledge gaps in the attention and choice literature and have implications for marketing research and managerial practice. © The Author(s) 2023.","attention and brand choice; Bayesian estimation; eye movements; K-fold cross-validation; prediction; utility accumulation","","","","","","","","Al-Moteri M.O., Symmons M., Plummer V., Cooper S., Eye Tracking to Investigate Cue Processing in Medical Decision-Making: A Scoping Review, Computers in Human Behavior, 66, 1, pp. 52-66, (2017); Anderson B.A., The Attention Habit: How Reward Learning Shapes Attentional Selection, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1369, 1, pp. 24-39, (2016); Arieli A., Ben-Ami Y., Rubinstein A., Tracking Decision Makers Under Uncertainty, American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, 3, 4, pp. 68-76, (2011); Ashby N.J.S., Jekel M., Dickert S., Glockner A., Finding the Right Fit: A Comparison of Process Assumptions Underlying Popular Drift-Diffusion Models, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 42, 12, pp. 1982-1993, (2016); Atalay A.S., Bodur H.O., Rasolofoarison D., Shining in the Center: Central Gaze Cascade Effect on Product Choice, Journal of Consumer Research, 39, 4, pp. 848-866, (2012); Bartos V., Bauer M., Chytilova J., Matejka F., Attention Discrimination: Theory and Field Experiments with Monitoring Information Acquisition, American Economic Review, 106, 6, pp. 1437-1475, (2016); Belopolsky A.V., Theeuwes J., When Are Attention and Saccade Preparation Dissociated?, Psychological Science, 20, 11, pp. 1340-1347, (2009); Bettman J.R., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Constructive Consumer Choice Processes, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 3, pp. 187-217, (1998); Brandstatter E., Korner C., Attention in Risky Choice, Acta Psychologica, 152, October, pp. 166-176, (2014); Busemeyer J.R., Wang Y.-M., Model Comparisons and Model Selections Based on Generalization Criterion Methodology, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 44, 1, pp. 171-189, (2000); Chandon P., Hutchinson J.W., Bradlow E.T., Young S.H., Measuring the Value of Point-of-Purchase Marketing with Commercial Eye-Tracking Data, Visual Marketing: From Attention to Action, pp. 225-258, (2007); Chandon P., Hutchinson J.W., Bradlow E.T., Young S.H., Does In-Store Marketing Work?

How do people balance moral rights against moral wrongs when evaluating others' actions? Across 9 studies, we contrast the predictions of three conceptions of intuitive morality—outcome-based (utilitarian), act-based (deontologist), and person-based (virtue ethics) approaches. These experiments establish four principles: Partial offsetting (good acts can partly offset bad acts), diminishing sensitivity (the extent of the good act has minimal impact on its offsetting power), temporal asymmetry (good acts are more praiseworthy when they come after harms), and act congruency (good acts are more praiseworthy to the extent they offset a similar harm). These principles are difficult to square with utilitarian or deontological approaches, but sit well within person-based approaches to moral psychology. Inferences about personal character mediated many of these effects (Studies 1–4), explained differences across items and across individuals (Studies 5–6), and could be manipulated to produce downstream consequences on blame (Studies 7–9); however, there was some evidence for more modest roles of utilitarian and deontological processing too. These findings contribute to conversations about moral psychology and person perception, and may have policy and marketing implications. © 2020","Intuitive ethics; Moral judgment; Person perception; Reputation; Social cognition","Humans; Judgment; Morals; adult; article; Christian; conception; conversation; ethics; human; marketing; morality; perception; prediction; psychology; social cognition; decision making","","","","","University of Bath School of Management; Yale Cognition & Development Lab","We thank Frank Keil for his support, the Yale Cognition & Development Lab for useful comments, and the University of Bath School of Management for funding.

In the dynamic environment of multi-channel customer contact, organizational decision-makers often rely on robust but simplistic forecasting methods. Although forecasting literature indicates that incorporating additional information into time series predictions adds value by improving model performance, extant research in the call center domain barely considers the potential of sophisticated multivariate models. Hence, with an extended dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) approach, this study proposes a new reliable method for call center arrivals’ forecasting that is able to capture the dynamics of a time series and to include contextual information in form of predictor variables. The study evaluates the predictive potential of the approach on the call and e-mail arrival series of a leading German online retailer comprising 174 weeks of data. The analysis involves time series cross-validation with an expanding rolling window over 52 weeks and comprises established time series as well as machine learning models as benchmarks. The multivariate DHR model outperforms the compared models with regard to forecast accuracy for a broad spectrum of lead times. This study further gives contextual insights into the selection and optimal implementation of marketing-relevant predictor variables such as catalog releases, mail as well as postal reminders, or billing cycles. © 2021, The Author(s).","Call center arrivals; Customer relationship management; Dynamic harmonic regression; Forecasting; Machine learning; Time series analysis","","","","","","Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Landesentwicklung und Energie; Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Infrastruktur, Verkehr und Technologie, StMWi; Bayerische Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Landesentwicklung und Energie, StMWi","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Channel splits have changed and online conversations have exploded. Marketing budgets have decreased as a percentage of revenue, meaning marketing funds must be used more effectively and efficiently than ever. Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers. This paper shows that with the right ‘business translator’ — that is, a person or team operating as the ‘glue’ between data science and business performance — sophisticated data science becomes accessible to commercial teams looking to drive performance improvements. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Galaz V., Centeno M.

Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to identify and select empirical studies published in the last five years, between 2019 and 2023, in nine research databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, Emerald, Wiley Online, Sage, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar). Thus, 243 studies were included in the review. Results: The analyzed studies are mainly classified into four different themes of neuromarketing application: purchase decision, behavioral prediction, advertising effects, and customer retention. The main segments analyzed were e-commerce and retail. The predominance of quantitative studies and the need to control sociodemographic variables in the models is highlighted. In summary, there is a suggested need for more multimethod approaches that combine eye-tracking with quantitative and qualitative methods (retrospective interviews), as well as integrate it with other techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), facial biometrics, among others. Theoretical/Methodological Contributions: This research advances the understanding of the state of the art on eye-tracking and its application in neuromarketing, providing insights into methodological pathways. Originality/Relevance: Therefore, the main applications and emerging themes that can be explored in future studies are discussed. The proposal was previously registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022315763) and at the time of registration, there was no similar protocol. © 2024 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

Marketing persistence modeling is a well-established framework for the analysis of retail sales dynamics using a time series approach. However, dominant academic approaches to persistence modeling are rather complex, requiring sophisticated analytic and computing skills. We introduce a decision making approach that allows jointly testing and predicting the evolution of retail sales using a state-space model. We first propose a model, which incorporates the foundations of persistence modeling, and provide a simple estimation method. Secondly, we show a formal procedure for detecting persistence and, hence, selecting parameters to predict future data. An empirical investigation carried out over nearly 30000 Walmart retail sales, shows that our model provides significantly better prediction performance when compared to standard benchmarks. The combination of simplicity and efficiency makes our approach appealing not only for scholars but also for practitioners. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Marketing persistence; Model confident set; Prediction accuracy; State-space models","","","","","","","","Assimakopoulos V., Nikolopoulos K., The theta model: A decomposition approach to forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting, 16, 4, pp. 521-530, (2000); Banks G.C., Rogelberg S.G., Woznyj H.M., Landis R.S., Rupp D.E., Evidence on questionable research practices: The good, the bad, and the ugly, Journal of Business and Psychology, 31, 3, pp. 323-338, (2016); Bronnenberg B.J., Mahajan V., Vanhonacker W.R., The emergence of market structure in new repeat-purchase categories: The interplay of market share and retailer distribution, Journal of Marketing Research, 37, 1, pp. 16-31, (2000); Clarke D.G., Econometric measurement of the duration of advertising effect on sales, Journal of Marketing Research, 13, 4, pp. 345-357, (1976); Dekimpe M.G., Franses P.H., Hanssens D.M., Naik P.A., Time-series models in marketing, Handbook of marketing decision models, pp. 373-398, (2008); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., The persistence of Marketing Effects on Sales, Marketing Science, 14, 1, pp. 1-21, (1995); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., Empirical generalizations about market evolution and stationarity, Marketing Science, 14, 3_supplement, pp. G109-G121, (1995); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., Sustained spending and persistent response: A new look at long-term marketing profitability, Journal of Marketing Research, 4, pp. 397-412, (1999); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., Time-series models in marketing:: Past, Present and Future, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 17, 2-3, pp. 183-193, (2000); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., Time-series models in marketing: some recent developments, Marketing Journal of Research and Management, 1, 1, pp. 93-98, (2010); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., Silva-Risso J.M., Long-run effects of price promotions in scanner markets, Journal of Econometrics, 89, 1-2, pp. 269-291, (1998); Deleersnyder B., Geyskens I., Gielens K., Dekimpe M.G., How cannibalistic is the Internet channel?

To retain consumers, practitioners aim to predict which consumers intend to churn (ie leave), and to understand the reasons behind this intention. To address this need, this study uses data-mining techniques to develop a churn prediction model. The study aims to identify the information that is predictive of churn and, consequently, to shed light on the psychological reasons behind churn. The authors built eight predictive models using decision trees, random forest and logistic regression on a dataset composed of 81,813 consumers of an energy provider, each with one residential electricity contract. The logistic regression was found to outperform the other methods. The discussion focuses on the relevant predictors of churn by addressing a posteriori psychological explanations of consumers’ churn behaviour. The study provides new insights on the reasons why customers churn and, by addressing theoretical psychological explanations, provides a data-mining model with robustness to contextual changes. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Churn prediction model; Consumer psychology; Customer churn; Energy market; Machine learning","","","","","","","","Neslin S.A., Gupta S., Kamakura W., Lu J.X., Mason C.H., Defection detection: measuring and understanding the predictive accuracy of customer churn models, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 2, pp. 204-211, (2006); Thaichon P., Quach T.N., Integrated marketing communications and their effects on customer switching intention, Journal of Relationship Marketing, 15, 1–2, pp. 1-16, (2016); Chuang Y.F., Pull-and-suck effects in Taiwan mobile phone subscribers switching intentions, Telecommunication Policy, 35, 2, pp. 128-140, (2011); Ganesh J., Arnold M.J., Reynolds K.E., Understanding the customer base of service providers: an examination of the differences between switchers and stayers, Journal of Marketing, 64, 3, pp. 65-87, (2000); Verbeke W., Martens D., Mues C., Baesens B., Building comprehensible customer churn prediction models with advanced rule induction techniques, Expert System with Application, 38, 3, pp. 2354-2364, (2011); Kuo Y.F., Hu T.L., Yang S.C., Effects of inertia and satisfaction in female online shoppers on repeat-purchase intention:The moderating roles of word-of-mouth and alternative attraction, Managing Service Quality: An International Journal, 23, 3, pp. 168-187, (2013); Keaveney S.M., Parthasarathy M., Customer switching behavior in online services: an exploratory study of the role of selected attitudinal, behavioral, and demographic factors, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 29, 4, pp. 374-390, (2001); Dalvi P.K, Khandge S.K., Deomore A., Bankar A., Kanade V.A., Analysis of customer churn prediction in telecom industry using decision trees and logistic regression, the 2016 Symposium on Colossal Data Analysis and Networking (CDAN), (2016); Ahmed A.A.Q., Maheswari D., Churn prediction on huge telecom data using hybrid firefly based classification, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 18, 3, pp. 2-7, (2016); Mahajan V., Misra R., Mahajan R., Review of data-mining techniques for churn prediction in telecom, Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences, 39, 2, pp. 183-197, (2015); Holtrop N., Wieringa J.E., Gijsenberg M.J., Verhoef P.C., No future without the past?

We report on a series of experiments designed to test for and improve our understanding of the “precise first offer” (PFO) effect in bargaining and whether it likely reflects rational optimizing or equilibrium behavior. Our experiment varies whether decisions are incentivized and whether the PFO effect can emerge as an equilibrium of a cheap-talk signaling game. We find evidence of a PFO effect when subjects read a vignette and make unincentivized individual decisions. When monetary incentives are added to the vignette, we still find the PFO effect, but it is not robust. In a bilateral bargaining situation with a cheap-talk equilibrium, we can not find the PFO effect, which is inconsistent with the equilibrium predictions. Moreover, the PFO effect reemerges in a setting in which initial offers are generated by a random device and thus provides a strong refutation of the signaling model. Our evidence suggests that optimizing and equilibrium accounts of the PFO effect are inadequate.

Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a category of services that offers considerable potential for organisations to extract valuable insights from their data while reducing the requirement for heavy technical expertise. This article explores the use of MLaaS within the realm of marketing applications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of MLaaS implementations and their benefits within the domain of marketing. Furthermore, we present a platform that possesses the capability to be customised and expanded to address marketing’s unique requirements. Three modules are introduced: Churn Prediction, One-2-One Product Recommendation, and Send Frequency Prediction. When applied to marketing, the proposed MLaaS system exhibits considerable promise for use in applications such as automated detection of client churn prior to its occurrence, individualised product recommendations, and send time optimisation. Our study revealed that AI-driven campaigns can improve both the Open Rate and Click Rate. This approach has the potential to enhance customer engagement and retention for businesses while enabling well-informed decisions by leveraging insights derived from consumer data. This work contributes to the existing body of research on MLaaS in marketing and offers practical insights for businesses seeking to utilise this approach to enhance their competitive edge in the contemporary data-oriented marketplace. © 2024 by the authors.","churn prediction; machine learning; marketing; MLaaS; product recommendation; send frequency; service","","","","","","Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC; COMPETE 2020; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This article is a result of the project \u201CCria\u00E7\u00E3o de um N\u00FAcleo de I&D para a gera\u00E7\u00E3o de novo conhecimento nas \u00E1reas de Intelig\u00EAncia Artificial, Machine Learning, Intelligent Marketing e One-2-One Marketing\u201D, handled by the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation (COMPETE 2020) through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement.","Volume of Data/Information Created, Captured, Copied, and Consumed Worldwide from 2010 to 2020, with Forecasts from 2021 to 2025, (2021); Huang M.H., Rust R.T., A strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing, J.

Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.","decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization","Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Decision-focused learning; Differentiable greedy; Edge bundling; End to end; End-to-end learning; Graph visualization; Influence maximizations; Influential nodes; Maximization problem; Model prediction; Data visualization","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE).","Chen W., Wang C., Wang Y., Scalable Influence Maximization for Prevalent Viral Marketing in Large-Scale Social Networks, Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’10, pp. 1029-1038; Bond R., Fariss C., Jones J., Kramer A., Marlow C., Settle J., Fowler J., A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization, Nature, 489, pp. 295-298, (2012); Bedi M., Social networks, government surveillance, and the Fourth Amendment Mosaic Theory, BUL Rev, 94, (2014); Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’03, pp. 137-146; Sakaue S., Differentiable Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization: Guarantees, Gradient Estimators, and Applications, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 130, pp. 28-36, (2021); Anscombe F.J., Graphs in Statistical Analysis, Am.

As part of Amperity’s enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing ”out of the box”. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns. Empirical results show that our enhanced model consistently surpasses benchmark performances for twelve retail brands across six evaluation intervals from June 2020 to September 2022. © The Author(s) 2023. corrected publication 2023.","Churn prediction; Customer data platform; Customer lifetime value; Ensemble modeling; M31; Marketing analytics","","","","","","","","Bahnsen A.C., Aouada D., Ottersten B., A novel cost-sensitive framework for customer churn predictive modeling, Decision Analytics, 2, 1, (2015); Bauer J., Jannach D., Improved customer lifetime value prediction with sequence-to-sequence learning and feature-based models, 15, 5, (2021); Chamberlain B.P., Cardoso A., Liu C.H.B., Pagliari R., Deisenroth M.P., Customer lifetime value prediction using embeddings, (2017); Chen T., Guestrin C., Xgboost: A scalable tree boosting system, pp. 785-794, (2016); Maximizing customer lifetime value using stacked neural networks: An insurance industry application, In 2019 18Th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), pp. 541-544, (2019); Fader P., Hardie B., A Note on Deriving the Pareto/Nbd Model and Related Expressions, (2005); Fader P.S., Hardie B.G., The gamma-gamma model of monetary value, February, 2, pp. 1-9, (2013); Fader P., Hardie B., Lee K., Counting your customers the easy way: An alternative to the pareto/nbd model, Marketing Science, 24, pp. 275-284, (2005); Glady N., Baesens B., Croux C., A modified pareto/nbd approach for predicting customer lifetime value, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2, pp. 2062-2071, (2009); Gnanadesikan R., Methods for statistical data analysis of multivariate observations, (2011); Gupta S., Hanssens D., Hardie B., Kahn W., Kumar V., Lin N., Ravishanker N., Sriram S., Modeling customer lifetime value, Journal of Service Research - J SERV RES, 9, pp. 139-155, (2006); Herbert R., An empirical bayes approach to statistics, Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1, pp. 157-163, (1956); Jasek P., Vrana L., Sperkova L., Smutny Z., Kobulsky M., Modeling and application of customer lifetime value in online retail, Informatics, 5, (2018); Jasek P., Vrana L., Sperkova L., Smutny Z., Kobulsky M., Comparative analysis of selected probabilistic customer lifetime value models in online shopping, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 20, pp. 398-423, (2019); Johannemann J., Hadad V., Athey S., Wager S., Sufficient representations for categorical variables, (2019); Johnson S.C., Hierarchical clustering, Psychometrika, 32, 3, pp. 241-254, (1967); Kalm K., Scully R., Haghighi A., Fagan H., A Report on the Error Rates of Customer Misidentification and Why This is So Bad for Your Business, (2019); Martinez A., Schmuck C., Pereverzyev S., Pirker C., Haltmeier M., A machine learning framework for customer purchase prediction in the non-contractual setting, European Journal of Operational Research, (2018); Micci-Barreca D., A preprocessing scheme for high-cardinality categorical attributes in classification and prediction problems, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 3, 1, pp. 27-32, (2001); Mikolov T., Sutskever I., Chen K., Corrado G.S., Dean J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality, In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3111-3119, (2013); Platt J., Et al., Probabilistic outputs for support vector machines and comparisons to regularized likelihood methods, Advances in large margin classifiers, 10, 3, pp. 61-74, (1999); Schmittlein D.C., Morrison D.G., Colombo R., Counting your customers: Who are they and what will they do next?, Management Science, 33, 1, pp. 1-24, (1987); Sill J., Takacs G., Mackey L.W., Lin D., Feature-weighted linear stacking, (2009); Thai-Nghe N., Gantner Z., Schmidt-Thieme L., Cost-sensitive learning methods for imbalanced data, pp. 1-8, (2010); Vanderveld A., Pandey A., Han A., Parekh R., An engagement-based customer lifetime value system for e-commerce, pp. 293-302, (2016); Venkatesan R., Kumar V., A customer lifetime value framework for customer selection and resource allocation strategy, Journal of Marketing, 68, 4, pp. 106-125, (2004); Wang X., Liu T., Miao J., A deep probabilistic model for customer lifetime value prediction, (2019); Yan Y., Meyles S., Haghighi A., Suciu D., Entity matching in the wild: A consistent and versatile framework to unify data in industrial applications, Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 2287-2301, (2020); Zhang J., Dixit A., Friedmann R., Customer loyalty and lifetime value: An empirical investigation of consumer packaged goods, The Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 18, pp. 127-140, (2010)","Y.

It also tackles the endogenous issues regarding the strategic choice of platform types. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Heckman’s two-stage procedures to examine the relationship between the variables. The sample in this study comes from Compustat annual company and segment files. The sample used in the main analysis consists of 252 individual corporations globally and 3,528 firm-year observations from 2004–2017. Findings: The empirical results suggest that: (1) firms are more likely to develop physical platforms than virtual platforms when they possess higher levels of available slack, potential slack, research and development (R&D) capacity and marketing capacity; (2) in general, firms developing physical platforms perform better than firms developing virtual platforms after the endogeneity bias are controlled; and (3) firms that choose to develop physical platforms perform better than if they had chosen to develop virtual platforms. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the platform research literature by proposing the endogenous role of platform type choice in firm performance in the context of the retail industry. Prior conceptual and theoretical platform studies have seldom focused on the retail industry through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. This study also presents many opportunities for further explorations on the relationship between firm strategic choice and firm performance in the context of platform retail industry. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that firms must realize that their performance is not necessarily affected by these platform type choice determinants in terms of potential slack, available slack, R&D capacity and marketing capacity. By contrast, they should pay more attention to developing physical platforms if it is possible. The study findings indicate that although virtual platforms have grown rapidly because of the development of technology, firm performance is at all times superior when firms choose to develop physical platforms. Originality/value: Prior platform studies have focused on the topic of network structure, platform architecture, pricing strategy, platform leadership and platform design and governance within the context of video game industry, software industry, hardware industry and telecommunications industry. Seldom of them focus on other industries through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business strategy; Electronic commerce; Organizational capacity; Physical platform; Retail industry; Slack resource; Strategic management; Virtual platform","","","","","","","","Afuah A., Are network effects really all about size?

However, the abundance of user-generated content data makes it challenging to analyze and derive insights from it. As a result, the demand for sentiment analysis research has increased. This work intends to highlight the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis through a bibliometric analysis. To our knowledge, bibliometric research of sentiment analysis on user-generated content has never been conducted. The research methodology adopted for this study was essentially divided into four phases. Those phases include data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis and report writing. This bibliometric research successfully identified the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis. This study will give a baseline for future researchers to start another study. Big data, text analytics, text mining, tourism, covid-19, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, making predictions, and marketing decisions are among the most recent research interests for sentiment analysis of user-generated content.

Green cosmetics (GC) are products developed and marketed based on ecological sustainability and have shown increasing consumer appeal worldwide. The current research investigates the antecedents of green cosmetics consumption among Indian GC users, hitherto un-investigated comprehensively. Design/methodology/approach: The study is a cross-sectional pairwise comparison of green evaluation criteria for cosmetics using an expert panel of thirty Indian cosmetic users using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) and investigate the impact of a comprehensive list of antecedents on the multi-criteria category consumption decision. Findings: The study results indicate that perceived consumer effectiveness is the most critical factor for green cosmetics consumption in India, followed by brand trust, behavioural control, and environmental effectiveness. The least important factors are price and social norms. Research limitations/implications: As the GC category is at nascent stage in India the investigation is limited to the GC category innovators – a set of people high in intellectual and financial resources. The study is also limited to women users as the male cosmetic market in the country is still very small. Practical implications: The study results can help marketers in designing and implementing GC related marketing strategies to deliver higher customer value to the target segment. Academicians can use the study results for better prediction of category related behaviour of consumers. Social implications: The study results will help promote GC category adoption and usage which can benefit the environment and consumer health. Originality/value: The study contributes to literature and practice by assessing a comprehensive set of critical antecedents to GC adoption using a novel approach of F-AHP and an expert user panel. The study results offer insights to marketers that can be used to develop suitable strategies to convert non-GC users into GCs in India and similar markets, improving category penetration and benefitting marketers, retailers, users, and the environment. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Antecedents;

The PMTA authorisation represents the first time that FDA has authorised an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) for marketing in the USA. Using the FDA Decision Summary, the special communication identifies significant unanswered public health and scientific questions that prevent the authors from reaching FDA's conclusion that Vuse meets the Appropriate for the Protection of the Public Health (APPH) standard. The authors recommend FDA suspend the market authorisation and use these questions to re-evaluate the PMTA, and to prospectively monitor whether Vuse meets APPH standard. The special communication advances the ENDS harm reduction conversation because it calls for national tobacco regulators to develop an epidemiological prediction of ENDS impact on the population and to expand the scope of their analysis to evaluate the impacts of ENDS on congenital birth defects, abuse liability and non-flavour drivers of youth usage. Through learning from the American experience regulating Vuse, national tobacco regulators around the globe will be better equipped to evaluate the impact of ENDS on the public health.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Predicting share price behavior in the economy and financial marketing theory is crucial but complex. The Industrial Bank of Korea’s (IBK) share prices are also affected by hidden factors, including Korean international trade flow. The study aims to forecast hidden impacts on IBK share prices resulting from the international trade flow in Korea. Design/Methodology/Approach – Two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approaches are employed, one based on exports, and the other on imports, to identify trends and fluctuations in the hidden states influencing visible states. Findings – The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between IBK share prices and both exports and imports. Notably, increasing exports indicate a 50% probability of IBK share prices rising, while falling imports indicate a 56% chance of IBK share prices increasing. These results demonstrate how changes in exports and imports impact IBK’s share price in the Korean stock market. Research Implications – The research implications are valuable for short-and long-term investors in IBK shares and the Korean stock exchange. This research can help decision-makers identify the relationships between and within the visible/observed states that influence the stock price of IBK. © 2023 International Academy of Global Business and Trade.

Specifically, the authors use the mechanism of firms' international entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) to examine how owner CEO narcissism may influence SMEs' post-entry speed of internationalization (PSI), both directly and indirectly. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors draw on data from a two-wave questionnaire and on archival export data from 291 Chinese exporting SMEs in three municipalities and 17 provinces from 2019 to 2020. Findings: The results support the theoretical predictions that owner CEO narcissism shapes exporting SMEs' decisions on PSI, both directly and indirectly, through the mediation of firm-level IEO. Originality/value: The study extends emerging research on the role of CEO narcissism in the upper echelons literature into the international marketing (IM) context. It also offers new insights into what drives exporting SMEs' IM decision-making from a psychological microfoundations perspective. Furthermore, the authors theoretically establish and empirically demonstrate the key role of a firm's IEO as a mediator to complement the existing literature's focus on the direct influence of CEO narcissism on firms' internationalization decisions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","IM decision-making;

This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Credit scoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power-law distribution; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence","","","","","","Top Innovation Graduate Student Cultivation Project Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71671048); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Guangdong University of Technology, GDUT, (262515006); Guangdong University of Technology, GDUT","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71671048]; Guangdong Construction of High-Level Colleges for Postgraduate Study Abroad Project in Guangdong University of Technology [grant number 262515006]; and Top Innovation Graduate Student Cultivation Project Fund.","Ahelegbey D.F., Giudici P., Hadji-Misheva B., Latent factor models for credit scoring in P2P systems, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 522, pp. 112-121, (2019); Baesens B., Van Gestel T., Viaene S., Stepanova M., Suykens J., Vanthienen J., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 6, pp. 627-635, (2003); Bayer J., Customer segmentation in the telecommunications industry, Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management, 17, 3-4, pp. 247-256, (2010); Benkedjouh T., Medjaher K., Zerhouni N., Rechak S., Health assessment and life prediction of cutting tools based on support vector regression, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 26, 2, pp. 213-223, (2015); Candel A., Parmar V., LeDell E., Arora A., Deep Learning with H2O, pp. 1-21, (2016); Chang S.-Y., Yeh T.-Y., An artificial immune classifier for credit scoring analysis, Applied Soft Computing, 12, 2, pp. 611-618, (2012); Chester D.L., Why two hidden layers are better than one, Proc.

Gathering data from two different sources, Flickr and Twitter, textual and visual contents are used to perform different analytics tasks to generate insights on tourist behaviour and the affective aspects of the destination image. Design/methodology/approach: This work adopts a method based on a multimodal approach on BSD and analytics, considering multiple BSD sources, different analytics techniques on heterogeneous data types, to obtain complementary results on the Salento region (Italy) case study. Findings: Results show that the generated insights allow DMOs to acquire new knowledge about discovery of unknown clusters of points of interest, identify trends and seasonal patterns of tourist demand, monitor topic and sentiment and identify attractive places. DMOs can exploit insights to address its needs in terms of decision support for the management and development of the destination, the enhancement of destination attractiveness, the shaping of new marketing and communication strategies and the planning of tourist demand within the destination. Originality/value: The originality of this work is in the use of BSD and analytics techniques for giving DMOs specific insights on a destination in a deep and wide fashion. Collected data are used with a multimodal analytic approach to build tourist characteristics, images, attitudes and preferred destination attributes, which represent for DMOs a unique mean for problem-solving, decision-making, innovation and prediction. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data analytics; Big data analytics; DMO; Tourism destination management; Tourist behaviour","","","","","","Albania; NEST","The approach described in this paper is adopted in the NEST (Networking for smart tourism development, INTERREG-IPA CBC Italia-Albania-Montenegro – Project n. 96-1· call for standard project – co-financed by the European Union under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II)) project, which aims at enabling a cross-border cooperation between Albania, Italy and Montenegro, in order to create a common branding of the Adriatic-Ionian area as a smart tourism destination at a macro regional level and to develop common tourist routes and products.","Alvarez M.D., Campo S., The influence of political conflicts on country image and intention to visit: a study of Israel's image, Tourism Management, 40, pp. 70-78, (2014); Ammirato S., Felicetti A.M., Della Gala M., Raso C., Cozza M., Smart tourism destinations: can the destination management organizations exploit benefits of the ICTs?

In this research, conducted in the market for in vitro fertilization services, the authors empirically assess differences in quality of care between clinics that offer MBG programs and those that don't, to investigate whether MBG programs can serve a purpose consistent with signaling and insurance theories. The analysis is conducted on a unique longitudinal data set that includes information on clinic-level treatment, outcome statistics, clinic characteristics, and marketing practices for fertility clinics in the United States, state-level insurance mandates, competition environments, and demographic and geographic characteristics. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogeneity of MBG decisions made by fertility clinics, the authors find that MBG clinics, on average, offer better treatment outcomes in terms of success rates while undertaking lower risks.

When early information search influences choice in favor of that information, it is called primacy; the equivalent for later information search is called recency. However, research that disentangles primacy and recency effects during multi-attribute product choice, as well as studies on the cognitive processes underlying primacy and recency effects are lacking. I address this gap with two choice-based conjoint experiments combined with eye tracking and by means of multilevel mediation analysis. Consistent with my prediction that to counterbalance the impact of decision irrelevant information on choice through early information search by later information search is mentally too costly, I find that “spatial position” biases choice due to primacy rather than recency. This bias, however, is small. This suggests that for decision irrelevant information, the causal influence of attention on choice generalizes to more complex decisions, though with little impact. Consistent with my prediction that the level of information elaboration moderates the mediation process, increasing task motivation decreases the dominance of primacy. © 2023 The Author.

Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods","","","","","","","","Birant D, Data mining using RFM analysis, Knowledge-oriented applications in data mining (IntechOpen), (2011); Chang CJ, A Decision Support System for Audit Staff Scheduling of Multiple and Large-Scaled Engagements, Rev Bus Inf Syst, 6, pp. 27-40, (2002); De Haan E, Wiesel T, Pauwels K, The effectiveness of different forms of online advertising for purchase conversion in a multiple-channel attribution framework, Int J Res Mark, 33, pp. 491-507, (2016); Dodin B, Huang Chan K, Application of production scheduling methods to external and internal audit scheduling, Eur J Oper Res, 52, pp. 267-279, (1991); Edvardsson B, Gustafsson A, Roos I, Service portraits in service research: a critical review, International J Serv Ind Manage, 16, pp. 107-121, (2005); Grewala D, Roggeveen AL, Understanding Retail Experiences and Customer Journey Management, J Retailing, 96, pp. 3-8, (2020); Han DL, Tang LC, Huang HC, A Markov model for single-leg air cargo revenue management under a bid-price policy, Eur J Oper Res, 200, pp. 800-811, (2010); He B, Shi Y, Wan Q, Et al., Prediction of customer attrition of commercial banks based on SVM model, Pro Comput Sci, 31, pp. 423-430, (2014); Huang CY, Shen YC, Chiang IP, Et al., Characterizing Web users’ online information behavior, J Am Society Inf Sci Technol, 58, pp. 1988-1997, (2007); Klein R, Sebastian K, Steinhardt C, Et al., A review of revenue management: Recent generalizations and advances in industry applications, Eur J Oper Res, 284, pp. 397-412, (2020); Kraus M, Feuerriegel S, Oztekin A, Deep learning in business analytics and operations research: Models, applications and managerial implications, Eur J Oper Res, 281, pp. 628-641, (2020); Lemon KN, Verhoef PC, Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey, J Mark, 80, (2016); Mainak S, Bruyn AD, LSTM Response Models for Direct Marketing Analytics: Replacing Feature Engineering with Deep Learning, J Interact Mark, 53, pp. 80-95, (2021); Strauss AK, Klein R, Steinhardt C, A review of choice-based revenue management: Theory and methods, Eur J Oper Res, 271, pp. 375-387, (2018); Sun C, Adamopoulos P, Ghose A, Et al., Predicting stages in omnichannel path to purchase: A deep learning model, Inf Syst Res, 33, pp. 429-445, (2022)","T.-C.

It describes the strategic decision-making process of a firm as a performance feedback process and argues that performance shortfall, i. e., firms′ failing to achieve their aspirations, would make decision makers launch problemistic search to seek solutions to settling the problem of performance shortfall, consequently leading to organizational changes. Previous studies have established theoretical relationship between performance shortfalls and various kinds of organizational changes. However, no consensus has been reached about the effect of performance shortfalls. On one hand, many studies support the classic predictions of the behavioral theory of the firm and it′s found that performance shortfalls would lead to organizational changes of the firm. On the other hand, some studies indicate contrary evidence that performance shortfalls would reduce firms′ tendency to make organizational changes. This study holds that the way a firm responds to performance shortfall depends on decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfall and on the characteristics of that organizational change. To make up for the research gap described above, this study incorporates managerial ability into the behavioral theory of the firm and focuses on the quantity and the quality of firms′ patent applications with inherent tension. Specifically, this study examines how performance shortfall influences firms′ patenting strategies involving the quantity and the quality of patent applications and how managerial ability moderates the relationships between performance shortfall and patenting strategies. This study investigates managerial ability, because it would influence the performance feedback process of the two patenting strategies by altering decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfalls. This study focuses on firms′ patenting strategies for the following reasons. First, patenting strategies are common and important strategies for manufacturing firms to respond to performance shortfalls. Second, there is often a tension between the quantity and the quality of patent applications; therefore, decision makers have to weigh up those two options. Investigating the performance feedback processes of them may reveal the different effects of performance shortfall on organizational changes. This study uses a sample of Chinese A-share manufacturing listed firms in the period of 2011—2017. The data used in this study are from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR) and Wind Database (WIND), which have been widely employed in empirical studies on Chinese firms. To alleviate the potential effect of outliers, this study winsorizes variables with possible outliers at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their distributions. This study employs fixed effect models for panel data to test hypotheses. Fixed effect models can solve the problem that the explanatory variables are correlated with unobserved individual effects. This study uses Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to correct the problems of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation. The measurement of the quantity of patent applications is natural logarithm for the total number of patent applications of a firm. The quality of patent applications is measured as the ratio of the number of invention patent applications to the total number of patent applications. Performance shortfall means performance falls below the aspiration level. This study uses return on assets (ROA) to measure firm performance and focuses on social aspiration. Social aspiration is the average performance of all the other firms in focal firm′s industry. This study uses two-step data envelopment analysis (DEA) to obtain the measurement of managerial ability. As to control variables, this study controls R&D intensity, marketing intensity, unabsorbed slack resources, firm size, income tax ratio, the independence of the board, the size of top management team, ownership concentration, proportion of state-owned shares, positive performance discrepancy, industry dummy variables, and year dummy variables. This study suggests that there is a negative relationship between performance shortfalls and the quantity of patent applications so that the more the performance falls short of the performance aspiration, the smaller the quantity of patent applications would be. In addition, managerial ability would undermine this negative relationship. Moreover, there is a positive relationship between performance shortfalls and the quality of patent applications so that the more the performance falls below the performance aspiration, the higher the quality of patent applications would be, and managerial ability would strengthen this positive relationship. © (2023).

Moreover, this research investigates marketing firms' proper marketing strategies across different shipping channels. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted three studies using a large sample (N = 703) recruited from a diverse pool (students and adults) that examined multiple products (camera and car) across different shopping channels (online vs offline). Study 1a (n = 251) and Study 1b (n = 252) examined the effect of an online versus offline channel on consumers' decision-making using a one-factor (shopping channel: online vs offline) between-subjects design. Meanwhile, Study 2 (n = 200) investigated the effective strategies that firms should employ across different shopping channels using a 2 (shopping channel: online vs offline) × 2 (mental simulation: outcome vs process) between-subjects design. Participants in the online condition evaluated the product on a computer screen, whereas participants in the offline condition evaluated the real product assuming a real-world retail store setting. Findings: The three studies supported the predictions that shopping channels (online vs offline) affect consumers' psychological distance and, in turn, affect their decision process. Specifically, results reveal that the online (offline) channel increases (decreases) psychological distance and leads consumers to pay more attention to a product's desirability (feasibility) aspects. Originality/value: Given that many firms sell the same products through multiple channels, the findings of this research offer insightful theoretical and practical implications. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construal level; Decision-making; Offline; Online; Psychological distance; Shopping channel","","","","","","","","Akbar S., James P.T., Consumers' attitude towards online shopping factors influencing employees of crazy domains to shop online, Journal of Management and Marketing Research, 14, pp. 1-11, (2014); Alter A.L., Oppenheimer D.M., Zemla J.C., Missing the trees for the forest: a construal level account of the illusion of explanatory depth, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 99, 3, pp. 436-451, (2010); Arce-Urriza M., Cebollada J., Tarira M.F., The effect of price promotions on consumer shopping behavior across online and offline channels: differences between frequent and non-frequent shoppers, Information Systems and e-Business Management, 15, 1, pp. 69-87, (2017); Bae S., Lee T., Gender differences in consumers' perception of online consumer reviews, Electronic Commerce Research, 11, 2, pp. 201-214, (2011); Castano R., Sujan M., Kacker M., Sujan H., Managing consumer uncertainty in the adoption of new products: temporal distance and mental simulation, Journal of Marketing Research, 45, 3, pp. 320-336, (2008); Chen Y.H., Hsu I.C., Lin C.C., Website attributes that increase consumer purchase intention: a conjoint analysis, Journal of Business Research, 63, 9-10, pp. 1007-1014, (2010); Chu J., Arce-Urriza M., Cebollada-Calvo J.J., Chintagunta P.K., An empirical analysis of shopping behavior across online and offline channels for grocery products: the moderating effects of household and product characteristics, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 24, 4, pp. 251-268, (2010); Dai B., Forsythe S., Kwon W.S., The impact of online shopping experience on risk perceptions and online purchase intentions: does product category matter?, Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 15, 1, pp. 13-24, (2014); Dhar R., Kim E.Y., Seeing the forest or the trees: implications of construal level theory for consumer choice, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 17, 2, pp. 96-100, (2007); Dittmar H., Long K., Meek R., Buying on the internet: gender differences in on-line and conventional buying motivations, Sex Roles, 50, 5, pp. 423-444, (2004); Dzyabura D., Jagabathula S., Offline assortment optimization in the presence of an online channel, Management Science, 64, 6, pp. 2767-2786, (2018); Escalas J.E., Imagine yourself in the product: mental simulation, narrative transportation, and persuasion, Journal of Advertising, 33, 2, pp. 37-48, (2004); Flavian C., Gurrea R., Orus C., Combining channels to make smart purchases: the role of webrooming and showrooming, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 52, (2020); Forster M., Gerger G., Leder H., Everything's relative?

By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts. Experiments are carried out with a dataset from one of the top streaming service companies, and results display overall better performance compared to various standalone methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Embeddings; Gradient boosting decision tree; Popularity prediction; Streaming service","Cost reduction; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; E-learning; Forecasting; IPTV; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Video recording; Video streaming; Categorical variables; Historical data; Historical view; Hybrid machine learning; Online video streaming; Popularity predictions; Streaming service; Video contents; artificial neural network; comparative study; data set; Internet; machine learning; marketing; performance assessment; prediction; Learning systems","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2017-0-00705); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government( MSIP ) (No. 2017-0-00705 , Development of Media Streaming system with Machine Learning using QoE(Quality of Experience)) ","Bartlett P.L., Hazan E., Rakhlin A., Adaptive online gradient descent, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 65-72, (2007); Chen F., Zhang C., Wang F., Liu J., Wang X., Liu Y., Cloud-assisted live streaming for crowdsourced multimedia content, IEEE Trans Multimedia, 17, 9, pp. 1471-1483, (2015); Chen J., Chen C., Using particle swarm optimization algorithm in multimedia cdn content placement, 2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, pp. 45-51, (2012); Chen L., Zhou Y., Chiu D.M., Smart streaming for online video services, IEEE Trans.

However, existing approaches face difficulties analyzing consumer preferences over different attributes of alternatives (restaurants, hotels, etc.), which hinders product/service providers from comprehensively understanding consumer choice decisions. To address this issue, we solve for the consumer preferences over the attributes represented by attribute weights based on consumers’ historical data, including text comments and overall ratings. Specifically, for each comment and a corresponding rating, we first employ sentiment analysis to calculate values of the attributes, and then develop a quadratic programming model to solve for the weights. Based on a stream of a consumer's text comments and overall ratings, we can correspondingly obtain a stream of weights indexed by the comment time. We then model this stream of weights as hesitant judgments and employ a hesitant multiplicative programming method to solve for the final weights that fit the consumer's preferences over attributes at the highest satisficing level. In the application of recommendation, our approach not only provides insights into the consumer's preferences but also has higher prediction power compared with some state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer preference; Decision analysis; Hesitant judgment; Pairwise comparisons; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis","Decision making; Decision theory; Marketing; Quadratic programming; Consumers' preferences; Hesitant judgment; Multi attribute decision making; Pair-wise comparison; Preference analysis; Product service; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis; Service provider; Social media; Sentiment analysis","","","","","Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation, (20GLC046); Program for Young Excellent Talents; University of International Business and Economics, UIBE, (19YQ08); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72002033); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (9222027, M21025); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21FGLB040)","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and editors for their constructive and detailed comments on the manuscript.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an online customer satisfaction survey to clients of a firm and with a comparative valuation with current competitors by customer. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis, obtaining β for each variable by relating the variables to the SOP, presenting the relative effect of the variables and the best global explanation of the model. Findings: This new model has good prediction accuracy and shows a clear impact of different relative satisfaction indicators and, to a minor degree, business and relationship characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this model is that it is based on data from only one company, but it should have value in other sectors and provide full insight through its transversal application. Originality/value: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers and determined how the improvements in customer satisfaction translate into business growth. The study shows that the relative evaluation of satisfaction carries different meanings for customers, while all of them are better than absolute satisfaction. It includes a more understandable indicator than other prior relative indicators, the difference in satisfaction and is more effective. Additionally, it guides how to take advantage of the knowledge of relative customer satisfaction before competitors and demonstrates the courses of action with the potential best results. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business-to-business marketing;

This has led to new insights into persuasive message design. In general, persuasive advertisement messaging can be viewed as a combination of context, i.e., a message, and additional affiliated components such as images, video, and special graphics. It is composed out of two main attribute categorizations: (1) textual content such as a product description or affiliated message and (2) sensible content such as product image, color, or even scent. In a competitive market in which consumers are constantly exposed to a hyper-abundance of products that also contain sensible attributes, it is crucial to design persuasive messages that will maximally appeal to desired consumers and evoke their positive response. Yet only a few studies have focused on the effective design of persuasive advertisement messages characterized by two integrated elements. As such, this research focuses on effective persuasive message design with integrated product scent and color attributes. We demonstrate how a machine learning process can be utilized to generate optimal persuasive messages by estimating the contribution of each message attribute to the final class attribute: the purchase intention response. Our results show that several prediction algorithms can enhance consumer response value. In addition, correlations between several attributes affiliated with the message can be derived by graph theory-based estimation. This research thus provides insight into attribute values important for management decisions, with implications for effective persuasive message design.

Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

The authors explore the single and compounded effect of the motivational salience of food’s intrinsic reinforcing value tied to its sugar content and that of two marketing food cues, price and in-store display, on actual consumer purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above hypotheses in two perceived “healthy” product categories with a wide distribution of sugar content. The authors estimate a within-category model using three years of retail transaction data to test the effect on weekly sales. Findings: The authors confirm the single effect of each of food’s and marketing cues’ motivational salience as well as their compounded effect with high-motivational-salience food being less price elastic and more susceptible to in-store display activities. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the need to complement current reliance on unhealthy/healthy perception with finer grained objective evidence linked to the formulation of the food itself and the marketing applied to them. Practical implications: The present study findings may help marketing managers and policymakers develop better targeted pricing and display strategies for low- and high-motivational-salience food, attempting to strike a better balance between consumer welfare and commercial performance. Originality/value: This paper is one of the few that links real-world market outcomes to predictions derived from a unique combination of consumer neuroscience and neurobiology of food, advancing data-driven decisions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer neuroscience; Food preference; Merchandising; Pricing; Public policy","","","","","","","","Ailawadi K.L., Ma Y., Grewal D., The club store effect: Impact of shopping in warehouse club stores on consumers' packaged food purchases, Journal of Marketing Research, 55, 2, pp. 193-207, (2018); Andre Q., Chandon P., Haws K., Healthy through presence or absence, nature or science?

Specifically, the paper offers a novel perspective to predict repeated choice decisions in food consumption, which is termed as “pattern-seeking” – a consumption choice pattern that involves a coherent repetitive sequence of sub-groupings or coherently concentrated sub-groupings of options. Design/methodology/approach: Eight experimental studies that contrast the existing theoretical predictions regarding repeated choices (e.g. primacy effect, recency effect, variety vs consistency) against pattern-seeking were conducted using hypothetical and actual food choices. Findings: The results of experimental studies show that an explicit decision pattern (i.e. pattern-seeking) emerges as the most significant predictor of repeated choice in the food consumption domain. Research limitations/implications: This study offers a novel perspective on how consumers make repeated choices in the domain of food consumption. Practical implications: The results show that consumers prefer food consumption with a pattern (vs non-pattern). Thus, it would be better to generate marketing activities that allow customers to satisfy their pattern-seeking more easily. Originality/value: This study advances the literature on repeated food choices by demonstrating that people possess an inherent preference for patterns in food consumption. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer preference; Decision-making; Food consumption; Pattern seeking; Repeated choices","","","","","","","","Anderson N.H., Barrios A.A., Primacy effects in personality impression formation, The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 63, 2, pp. 346-350, (1961); Baghi I., Antonetti P., High-fit charitable initiatives increase hedonic consumption through guilt reduction, European Journal of Marketing, 51, 11-12, pp. 2030-2053, (2017); Bouisson J., Routinization preferences, anxiety, and depression in an elderly French sample, Journal of Aging Studies, 16, 3, pp. 295-302, (2002); Castro I.A., Morales A.C., Nowlis S.M., The influence of disorganized shelf displays and limited product quantity on consumer purchase, Journal of Marketing, 77, 4, pp. 118-133, (2013); Chapman G.B., Preferences for improving and declining sequences of health outcomes, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 13, 2, pp. 203-218, (2000); Chintagunta P.K., Inertia and variety seeking in a model of brand-purchase timing, Marketing Science, 17, 3, pp. 253-270, (1998); Cialdini R.B., Trost M.R., Newson J.T., Preference for consistency: the development of a valid measure and the discovery of surprising behavioral implications, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69, 2, pp. 318-328, (1995); Drolet A., Inherent rule variability in consumer choice: changing rules for change’s sake, Journal of Consumer Research, 29, 3, pp. 293-305, (2002); Epstein S., The stability of behavior: I.

The extensive research led to a scattered literature landscape. To organize the field quantitatively, we conduct bibliometric performance analyses and a bibliographic coupling analysis. Results show an increased interest in scenario research since 2009 and clear distinctions between strategic and operational as well as methodological and applied research. Future research can be expected to further enhance the method towards robust decision making and to combine it with methods searching for most likely scenarios, such as prediction markets, crowdsourcing, and superforecasting. Additionally, cognitive and behavioral aspects of using the scenario technique might draw further attention. The scenario technique is expected to be applied across all industries and will probably play an increasing role in currently underrepresented business functions such as marketing and innovation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bibliographic coupling;

The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy. After applying the decomposition part, the results have RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values of 49.59%, 22.58%, and 21.99% lower than those of the individual prediction part, respectively. This research presents a novel approach for market participants in the soybean industry for risk response. It gives a new perspective on agricultural product prices in sustainable agricultural marketing, while also providing practical tools for developing public policies and decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","CEEMDAN; CNN-GRU-Attention; fuzzy entropy; soybean spot price","China; cluster analysis; entropy; fuzzy mathematics; soybean; sustainability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71573042, 71973028)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 71573042 and 71973028.","Yao H., Zuo X., Zuo D., Lin H., Huang X., Zang C., Study on soybean potential productivity and food security in China under the influence of COVID-19 outbreak, Geogr.

However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies. Managerial implications are then discussed to guide the decision-making of traditional TV broadcasters and advertisers. © 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.","Bayesian updating theory; Dynamic learning; Forgetting; Marketing strategy evaluation","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71602089); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (11507817); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20160785); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (NR2019015)","This research was financial supported by NSFC (No. 71602089 ), Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (No. 11507817 ), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province , China (No. BK20160785 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( NR2019015 ).

The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

Dynamic pricing has been studied from the airline’s point of view, with a focus on demand forecasting and price differentiation. Early demand forecasting on a specific route can assist an airline in strategically planning flights and determining optimal pricing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A feedforward neural network was employed in the current study. Two hidden layers, consisting of 18 and 12 neurons, were incorporated to enhance the network’s capabilities. The activation function employed for these layers was tanh. Additionally, it was considered that the output layer’s functions were linear. The neural network inputs considered in this study were flight path, month of flight, flight date (week/day), flight time, aircraft type (Boeing, Airbus, other), and flight class (economy, business). The neural network output, on the other hand, was the ticket price. The dataset comprises 16,585 records, specifically flight data for Iranian airlines for 2022. Findings: The findings indicate that the model achieved a high level of accuracy in approximating the actual data. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to predict the optimal ticket price for various flight routes with minimal error. Practical implications: Based on the significant alignment observed between the actual data and the tested data utilizing the algorithmic model, airlines can proactively anticipate ticket prices across all routes, optimizing the revenue generated by each flight. The neural network algorithm utilized in this study offers a valuable opportunity for companies to enhance their decision-making processes. By leveraging the algorithm’s features, companies can analyze past data effectively and predict future prices. This enables them to make informed and timely decisions based on reliable information. Originality/value: The present study represents a pioneering research endeavor that investigates using a neural network algorithm to predict the most suitable pricing for various flight routes. This study aims to provide valuable insights into dynamic pricing for marketing researchers and practitioners. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airlines; Dynamic pricing; Neural network; Price prediction;

Given this, we introduce uplift modeling as a relevant prescriptive analytics tool. In particular, the uplift logit leaf model offers a segmentation-based algorithm that combines predictive performance with interpretability. Applied to a real-world data set of 6432 customers of a European software provider, the uplift logit leaf model achieves superior performance relative to three other popular uplift models in our study. The accessibility of output gained from the uplift logit leaf model also is showcased with a case study, which reveals relevant managerial insights. This new tool thus delivers novel insights in the form of customized, global, and segment-level visualizations that are especially pertinent to industrial marketing settings. Overall, the findings affirm the viability of uplift modeling for improving decisions related to B2B customer retention management. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Churn prediction; Customer retention; Interpretability;

Telemarketing is one of the most common interactive techniques of direct marketing, widely used by financial institutions such as banks to sell long-term deposits. In this study, we develop a BN model that predicts the likelihood that a potential client subscribes to a long-term deposit, which is considered an output variable. The causal relationship among client attributes and outcomes has been identified using the augmented Naïve Bayes approach, a well-known supervised learning algorithm. The impact of each client's attribute on the likelihood of subscribing is predicted. Further, we carry out multiple simulation scenarios using BN’s unique features (forward and backward propagation) to provide more in-depth discussions and analysis on predicting the likelihood of subscription for clients with particular characteristics. © 2021 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","decision making;

This paper studies how competitive retailers optimally design their product line if preferences at the store depend on whether the choice set draws consumer attention to the quality or price of a product. Before making a purchase decision, a consumer chooses among retailers without (fully) anticipating that her preferences at the store are malleable. We show that this setup can align evidence on retailer marketing practices and the existence of loss leaders with the experimental literature on decoy effects: in equilibrium, retailers use loss leaders to attract the consumer to the store and decoy products to draw consumer attention at the store to more profitable alternatives featuring a higher price (inducing a profitable upsell) or lower production cost (inducing a profitable downsell). We embed and compare the predictions of three recent specifications of choice-set dependent attention - namely, Salience, Focusing, and Relative Thinking. All three specifications predict that firms construct choice environments that utilize decoy effects to up- or downsell the consumer. Because they differ in how attention can be directed using the product line, however, they differ in their predictions of how the decoy will be positioned in the price-quality space.  © 2020 INFORMS.","Context; Decoys; Downselling; Focusing; Naïveté; Relative thinking; Retailer competition; Salience; Upselling","Forecasting; Product design; Profitability; Sales; Specifications; Context sensitive; Price quality; Product-lines; Production cost; Purchase decision; Costs","","","","","","","Ali SN, Learning self-control, Quart.

Recent advances in this form of artificial intelligence has been suggested to allow content creators and managers to transcend their tasks from creation towards editing, thus overcoming a common problem: the tyranny of the blank screen. In this research, we address this topic by proposing a novel system design that will suggest engagement-driven message features as well as automatically generate critical and fully written unique Tweet message components for the goal of maximizing the probability of relatively high engagement levels. Our multi-methods design relies on the use of econometrics, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics, all of which are widely used in the emerging fields of Business and Marketing Analytics. Our system design is intended to analyze Tweet messages for the purpose of generating the most critical components and structure of Tweets. We propose econometric models to judge the quality of written Tweets by way of engagement-level prediction, as well as a generative probability model for the auto-generation of Tweet messages. Testing of our design demonstrates the need to take into account the contextual, semantic, and syntactic features of messages, while controlling for individual user characteristics, so that generated Tweet components and structure maximizes the potential engagement levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian statistics; Business analytics; Marketing analytics; Natural language generation; Tweet generation; Tweet suggestion","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Economics; Managers; Semantics; Statistics; Systems analysis; Bayesian statistics; Component generation; Critical component; Econometric model; Engagement levels; Probability modeling; Syntactic features; User characteristics; Structural design","","","","","","","Zadeh A.H., Sharda R., Modeling brand post popularity dynamics in online social networks, Decis.

The customer character model (i.e restricted model) is compared to a full model consisting of the 4 Cs of capacity, collateral, credit, and character of churn prediction. The results reveal that there is a difference between the full model and the customer character model. Additionally, different supervised classification methods, such as logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision trees (DTs), and random forests (RFs), are applied and compared in terms of multiple predictive performance measures. The RF classification measures report the strongest performance. Additionally, different classification methods suggest the importance of different customer character variables. Therefore, from a practical perspective, effective borrower character screening is recommended to determine customer profiles more accurately for the purposes of target marketing and customer retention. This study also deepens understanding of subprime credit markets and reveals additional insights to credit screening using machine learning techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","4 Cs; Auto loans; Churn; Classification techniques; Credit screening; Machine learning; Subprime; Supervised learning","","","","","","","","Abu-Nimeh S.D., Nappa X., Wangnair S., A comparison of machine learning techniques for phishing detection, Proceedings of the Anti-Phishing Working Groups 2Nd Annual Ecrime Researchers Summit, pp. 60-69, (2007); Agarwal S., Ambrose B.W., Chomsisengphet S., Determinants of automobile loan default and prepayment, Economic Perspectives, 32, 3, pp. 17-27, (2008); Ahn Y., Kim D., Lee D.-J., Customer attrition analysis in the securities industry: A large-scale field study in Korea, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 38, 3, pp. 561-577, (2019); Ali O.G., Ariturk U., Dynamic churn prediction framework with more effective use of rare event data: The case of private banking, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 17, pp. 7889-7903, (2014); Assis C., Subprime Car Loans aren’t Subprime Mortgages Yet Still Worry Jamie Dimon and Now, John Oliver, (2016); Axelton K., How to Get a Used Car Loan, Experian, (2020); Barboza F., Kimura H., Altman E., Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); Braun M., Schweidel D.A., Modeling customer lifetimes with multiple causes of churn, Marketing Science, 30, 5, pp. 881-902, (2011); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Buckinx W., Van den Poel D., Customer base analysis: Partial defection of behaviorally loyal clients in a non-contractual FMCG retail setting, European Journal of Operational Research, 164, 1, pp. 252-268, (2005); Butler A.W.E.J., Mayerweston J., Racial Discrimination in the Auto Loan Market, (2020); Chawla N., Data mining for imbalanced datasets: An overview, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 875-886, (2009); Chen K., Hu Y., Hsieh Y., Predicting customer churn from valuable B2B customers in the logistics industry: A case study, Information Systems and E-Business Management, 13, 3, pp. 475-494, (2015); Chiang D.A., Wang Y.F., Lee S.L., Lin C.J., Goal-oriented sequential pattern for network banking churn analysis, Expert Systems with Applications, 25, 3, pp. 293-302, (2003); Clarke K.A., The phantom menace: Omitted variable bias in econometric research, Conflict Management and Peace Science, 22, 4, pp. 341-352, (2005); Courchane M.J., Surette B.J., Zorn P.M., Subprime borrowers: Mortgage transitions and outcomes, The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 29, 4, pp. 365-392, (2004); Coussement K., De Bock K.W., Customer churn prediction in the online gambling industry: The beneficial effect of ensemble learning, Journal of Business Research, 66, 9, pp. 1629-1636, (2013); Coussement K., Lessmann S., Verstraeten G., A comparative analysis of data preparation algorithms for customer churn prediction: A case study in the telecommunication industry, Decision Support Systems, 95, pp. 27-36, (2017); Coussement K., Van den Poel D., Churn prediction in subscription services: An application of support vector machines while comparing two parameter-selection techniques, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 1, pp. 313-327, (2008); Used Car Market Report & Outlook Forecast Higher Used-Vehicle Sales for 2018 and a Decline in New-Car Sales, (2018); De Caigny A., Coussement K., De Bock K.W., A new hybrid classification algorithm for customer churn prediction based on logistic regression and decision trees, European Journal of Operational Research, 269, 2, pp. 760-772, (2018); Delen D., A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management, Decision Support Systems, 49, 4, pp. 498-506, (2010); Denison D.G., Mallick B.K., Smith A.F., A Bayesian CART algorithm, Biometrika, 85, 2, pp. 363-377, (1998); Dogrusubasi N.A., February.

However, there is virtually no theoretical framework or systematic evidence that provides insights to platforms on how their business customers use these marketing tools. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework and apply it to an empirical setting to understand how business customers choose between two service offerings (paid search and hot shop) provided by an e-commerce platform. A unique aspect of our modeling framework is that we incorporate two types of heterogeneous strategic considerations in sellers’ choice decisions of marketing tools: competitor and consumer reactions. To capture seller consideration of competition, we adapt the cognitive hierarchy framework by modeling sellers’ differing abilities to predict how competition affects their decisions. To capture seller consideration of consumer response, we first specify a sales-response model in which sales are affected by the marketing tools used and then incorporate the response parameters in sellers’ payoff functions. Our empirical analysis indicates that these two types of strategic considerations are both important. Our estimation results show that, in making decisions on which marketing tool(s) to use, sellers tend to differentiate themselves from the competition. We also find that sellers with a higher rating tend to be more strategic. This finding provides a useful metric associated with firms’ strategic ability, which is often difficult to quantify, and helps researchers to test theoretical predictions related to firms’ strategic thinking using field data. We perform two comparative statics exercises to derive managerial insights. The first exercise offers a benchmark analysis to help platforms evaluate which targeted promotion strategies are most effective. The second exercise indicates that an increase in seller strategic ability would reduce the overall seller usage of marketing tools, and we offer specific suggestions to help platform managers increase the use of their marketing tools. © 2021 INFORMS.","behavioral economics; business-to-business marketing; choice modeling; cognitive hierarchy; competition; competitive analysis; electronic commerce; marketing tools; sales response parameters","","","","","","","","Adlakha S, Johari R, Mean field equilibrium in dynamic games with strategic complementarities, Oper.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a new index, called the sustainability index, based on the stakeholder perspective by employing a corporate credit risk index, an evaluation of a firm's corporate governance, corporate financial performance and firm age. The authors then apply both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Analysis and Fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (FsQCA) to obtain the optimal models for firms' sustainability. Findings: The OLS analysis shows that the variables including financial leverage, slack, innovation capability, manufacturing capability and human capital that have significant influences on the sustainability of firms. Our FsQCA analysis obtains configurations of several solutions for firm sustainability and concludes that the fit of combinations of institutional factors and/or internal resources and capabilities of a firm is related to its sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The limitations in our new index include these: first, one may add more key metrics to measure the index; second, the findings do not provide any necessary nor a sufficient condition to get sustainability for sure. The limitations of using multiple regression analysis are that it is not able to reveal the combinations of causal conditions that can lead to the outcome in the real world as well as to the sustainability of a firm in our study. To overcome the limitations, the authors apply fsQCA analysis to identify combinations of causal conditions to a firm's sustainability in our study. Practical implications: Introducing the sustainability index enables us to find out all factors influencing the sustainability of a firm. The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world. Their analysis enables managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. For example, the authors’ fsQCA analysis shows that low marketing capability will lead to the high sustainability of the firm. This information helps managers to make the decision or plan to achieve good results toward their businesses and get better allocate their resources and get a better investment. Social implications: The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world and enable managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. A correct prediction can assist companies in developing their future operations, which would enhance their competitiveness vis-à-vis rivals during this time of global economic volatility, which, in turn, enables firms to perform better and employ more employees that could help the entire society. Originality/value: The sustainability index the authors developed in our paper is new in the literature and the findings obtained by both OLS Regression Analysis and FsQCA are new in predicting a firm's sustainability. The authors’ findings are useful for academics, managers and policymakers in predicting and maintaining a firm's sustainability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate sustainability; Factors of sustainability; Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis; Prediction model; Sustainability index","","","","","","Hang Seng University of Hong Kong; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (12500915); China Medical University Hospital, CMUH; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (106-2410-H-468-002, 107-2410-H-468-002-MY3); Asia University, AU; Feng Chia University, FCU","The second author would also like to thank Robert B.

Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","COVID Twitter data; Machine learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Conventional machines; COVID twitter data; Feature engineerings; Learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction; Streaming texts; Text analysis; Forecasting","","","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","The authors would like to thank Ali Hussain Khan and Asif Iqbal Middya for their contribution in developing the CitizenSense application.

The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information. The resultant data aids in creating autonomous systems that consider the input from customers and prepare restaurant strategies. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Accuracy; Aspect-based; Classification; Document-based; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Uncertain feedback pool","Data mining; Decision making; Information retrieval systems; Lakes; Machine learning; Accuracy; Aspect-based; Decision-making process; Document-based; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Smart classification; Specific tasks; Uncertain feedback pool; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Chen H., Salem A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages, ACM Transact Inf Syst, 26, 3, pp. 1-34, (2008); Boire R., Data Mining Process.

Several outcomes and dimensions of benefit beyond utility feed into HTA processes. Objective: We analyse a proprietary dataset of HTA outcomes in 7 countries, to (a) test whether HTA decision-making is grounded in welfarist or extra-welfarist approaches; and (b) empirically determine the factors associated with positive HTA outcomes, the time to achieve these and establish the magnitude of inter-country differences in assessment processes. Methods: Data were extracted from publicly available HTA reports on drugs that received marketing authorisation between 2009 and 2018 (N = 1415). The outcomes of interest were the probability of positive HTA outcomes and the time-to-HTA outcome; these were examined with respect to clinical, regulatory, product- and disease-related, evidence uncertainty and contextual variables. Econometric models utilising survival analysis and multinomial logistic regression were specified. Findings: Positive HTA outcomes accounted for 87.3% of the sample (n = 1235), of which 71% (n = 1004) were restricted. Drugs with positive HTA outcomes were subject to clinical restrictions (n = 652, 46%), financial risk-sharing (n = 439, 31%) or had been rejected at least once (n = 282, 20%). Significant predictors of positive HTA outcomes were orphan drugs with cancer indications, high quality of evidence linked to clinical and economic evidence uncertainties which had been overcome, and contextual considerations, particularly innovativeness and unmet need. Comparative analyses revealed systematic differences between countries in their propensity to accept the same drugs, particularly oncology and orphan drugs. Conclusions: Our results are contextual and reinforce arguments in favour of explicitly accounting for social value judgements, establishing separate assessment frameworks for highly uncertain products, adopting risk mitigation strategies for novel therapies with early phase evidence, and sharing of HTA practices across settings. Lastly, HTA agencies have adopted an extra-welfarist approach to value assessment and resource allocation. © 2023 The Authors","Affordability; Cost-effectiveness; Drug pricing; Extra-welfarism; Health technology assessment; Priority setting; Social value judgements; Uncertainty","Algorithms; Biomedical Technology; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Heuristics; Humans; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; Retrospective Studies; Technology Assessment, Biomedical; antineoplastic agent; new drug; orphan drug; algorithm; decision making; drug development; efficiency measurement; health care; health policy; heuristics; marketing; OECD; policy approach; resource allocation; strategic approach; technology adoption; uncertainty analysis; welfare economics; algorithm; Article; Australia; biomedical technology assessment; Canada; comparative study; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; drug cost; drug indication; drug marketing; econometric model; England; France; Germany; health care access; health equity; heuristics; human; malignant neoplasm; marketing authorization; multinomial logistic regression; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; outcome assessment; prediction; Quebec; resource allocation; retrospective study; risk management; Scotland; social value; survival analysis; Sweden; uncertainty; algorithm; cost benefit analysis; medical technology; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development","","","","","Anna-Maria Fontrier","We are grateful to comments received by a number of colleagues in earlier versions of the paper: Alistair McGuire, Jaime Caro, Jaime Espin, Joan Rovira, Michael Drummond, Douglas Lundin, Americo Cicchetti, Jean Mossman, Ilias Kyriopoulos, Karen Facey, Sean Sullivan, Mackenzie Mills, Olina Efthymiadou, Anwen Zhang, Laia Maynou-Pujolras, Anna-Maria Fontrier, two anonymous referees and the editor of the Journal.

Researchers and practitioners have attempted to understand customer purchase behavior, but it remains elusive due to customers' heterogeneous and complex decision-making processes. This study addresses a gap in existing research by combining two types of factors affecting purchase behavior: past customer characteristics and current website browsing behavior. This study employs recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) to extract variables of customer characteristics and utilizes graph metrics to comprehensively measure browsing patterns. Based on these variables, this study conducts predictive analysis for purchase behavior and clustering analysis for session-level customer segmentation. Our findings reveal that integrating customer characteristics and browsing patterns significantly enhances purchase prediction and proposes a novel customer segmentation. This study not only provides theoretical and methodological contributions to decision support and e-commerce literature but also offers practical insights for real-time personalized marketing strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering analysis; Customer decision journey; Customer purchase behavior; Graph metrics; Predictive analysis; RFM","Decision making; Decision support systems; Electronic commerce; Sales; Browsing patterns; Clustering analysis; Customer decision journey; Customer decisions; Customer purchase behavior; Customers segmentations; E- commerces; Graph metrics; Monetary value; Recency, frequency, and monetary value; Predictive analytics","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2022R1F1A1073133); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No. NRF-2022R1F1A1073133).

The research examined the antecedents to the adoption of mobile tourism shopping (MTS) via an integrated model, consisting of the Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, consumer perception of merchant ethics, consumer decision-making styles, and characteristics of mobile applications. The results were empirically validated via the PLS-SEM-ANN method. The findings indicated that mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use, application quality, and service quality have significant positive correlations with the intention to use MTS, whereas privacy concern has displayed a significant negative relationship. Moreover, source reliability, application reputation, perfectionism, and novelty-fashion consciousness were revealed to be statistically insignificant to the development of adoption intention toward MTS. Furthermore, the ANN results have indicated the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute in the prediction of ANN Model A. The research has generated valuable theoretical implications and practical insights. For one, the advantages that come with the adoption of MTS and the security measures taken by the service providers should be highlighted to the prospects via effective marketing messages to nurture confidence, which can subsequently drive adoption. © 2021 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","artificial neural network analysis; consumer decision-making; Mobile commerce; privacy concern; tourism","Decision making; Mobile computing; Neural networks; Artificial neural network analysis; Consumer decision making; Consumer decision-making styles; Consumer perception; Integrated modeling; Mobile applications; Mobile Technology; Privacy concerns; Technology acceptance model; Tourism industry; Mobile commerce","","","","","","","Tan G.W.H., Lee V.H., Hew J.J., Ooi K.B., Wong L.W., “The interactive mobile social media advertising: An imminent approach to advertise tourism products and services?”, Telematics and Informatics, Elsevier, 35, 8, pp. 2270-2288, (2018); Sarkar S., Khare A., Sadachar A., Influence of consumer decision-making styles on use of mobile shopping applications, Benchmark An Int J, 27, 1, pp. 1-20, (2019); Hew J.J., Leong L.Y., Tan G.W.H., Ooi K.B., Lee V.H., The age of mobile social commerce: an artificial neural network analysis on its resistances, Technol Forecast Soc Change, 144, pp. 311-324, (2019); Hew J.J., Leong L.Y., Tan G.W.H., Lee V.H., Ooi K.B., Mobile social tourism shopping: a dual-stage analysis of a multi-mediation model, Tour Manag, Elsevier Ltd, 66, pp. 121-139, (2018); Hew J.J., Tan G.W.H., Lin B., Ooi K.B., Generating travel-related contents through mobile social tourism: does privacy paradox persist?, Telemat Inform, Elsevier Ltd, 34, 7, pp. 914-935, (2017); Dorcic J., Komsic J., Markovic S., Mobile technologies and applications towards smart tourism–state of the art, Tour Rev, 74, 1, pp. 82-103, (2019); Douglas A., Mobile business travel application usage Are South African men really from Mars and women from Venus?, J Hosp Tour Technol, 10, 3, pp. 269-285, (2019); Mahrous A.A., Hassan S.S., Achieving superior customer experience: an investigation of multichannel choices in the travel and tourism industry of an emerging market, J Travel Res, SAGE Publications Ltd, 56, 8, pp. 1049-1064, (2017); Ooi K.B., Tan G.W.H., Mobile technology acceptance model: an investigation using mobile users to explore smartphone credit card, Expert Syst Appl, 59, pp. 33-46, (2016); Tan G.W.H., Ooi K.B., Gender and age: do they really moderate mobile tourism shopping behavior?, Telemat Inform, Elsevier, 35, 6, pp. 1617-1642, (2018); Anwar A., Thongpapanl N., Ashraf A.R., Strategic imperatives of mobile commerce in developing countries: the influence of consumer innovativeness, ubiquity, perceived value, risk, and cost on usage, J Strateg Mark, 29, 8, pp. 722-742, (2021); Elbeltagi I., Agag G., E-retailing ethics and its impact on customer satisfaction and repurchase intention: a cultural and commitment-trust theory perspective, Internet Res, 26, 1, pp. 288-310, (2016); Mokhlis S., An investigation of consumer decision-making styles of young-adults in Malaysia, Int J Bus Manag, 4, 4, (2009); Tan G.W.H., Lee V.H., Hew J.J., Ooi K.B., Wong L.W., The interactive mobile social media advertising: an imminent approach to advertise tourism products and services?, Telemat Inform, Elsevier, 35, 8, pp. 2270-2288, (2018); Celik H., Customer online shopping anxiety within the unified theory of acceptance and use technology (UTAUT) framework, Asia Pacific J Mark Logist, 28, (2016); Shukla A., Sharma S.K., Evaluating consumers’ adoption of mobile technology for grocery shopping: an application of technology acceptance model, Vision, 22, 2, pp. 185-198, (2018); Tew H.-T., Tan G.W.-H., Loh X.-M., Lee V.-H., Lim W.-L., Ooi K.-B., Tapping the next purchase: embracing the wave of mobile payment, J Comput Inf Syst, pp. 1-9, (2021); Mohd Suki N., Determinants of consumers’ purchase intentions of organic vegetables: some insights from Malaysia, J Food Prod Mark, Routledge, 24, 4, pp. 392-412, (2018); Solomon M.R., Zaichkowsky J.L., Polegato R., Consumer behavior: buying, having, and being, (2008); Hasan B., Perceived irritation in online shopping: the impact of website design characteristics, Comp Human Behav, Elsevier Ltd, 54, pp. 224-230, (2016); McDowell W.C., Wilson R.C., Kile C.O., An examination of retail website design and conversion rate, J Bus Res, 69, 11, pp. 4837-4842, (2016); Tsao W.C., Hsieh M.T., Lin T.M.Y., Intensifying online loyalty!

Companies increasingly use algorithms to generate predictions for marketing decisions, such as which consumers to target with which offers. Such algorithmic decision-making promises to make marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective. Not surprisingly, machine learning is a trending topic for marketing researchers and practitioners. However, machine learning also introduces important challenges to the marketing landscape. We discuss this development by outlining recent progress and future research directions of machine learning in marketing. Specifically, we provide an overview of typical machine learning applications in marketing and present a guiding framework. We position the articles in the Journal of Business Research's Special Issue on “Machine Learning in Marketing” within this framework and conclude by putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Algorithm; Machine learning; Marketing; Privacy; Research agenda","","","","","","","","Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction machines: The simple economics of artificial intelligence, (2018); Airani R., Karande K., How social media effects shape sentiments along the twitter journey?

Phenomenon such as out of stock and slow sales has been common in recent years. These issues can be managed only when the occurrence of the sales volume is predicted in advance, and sufficient warnings can be executed in time. Thus, keeping in mind the importance of the sales prediction system, the purpose of this paper is to propose an effective sales prediction model and make digital marketing strategies with the machine learning model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the consumer purchasing behavior decision theory, we discuss the factors affecting product sales, including external factors, consumer perception, consumer potential purchase behavior and consumer traffic. Then we propose a sales prediction model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, using the time-series prediction that ensures the effective prediction of sales about each product in a short time on online stores based on the sales data in the previous term or month or year. The proposed M-GNA-XGBOOST model serves as an adaptive prediction model, for which the instant factors and the sales data of the previous period are the input, and the optimal computation is based on the proposed methodology. The adaptive prediction using the proposed model is developed based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The model inherits the advantages among the algorithms with better accuracy and forecasts the sales of each product in the store with instant data characteristics for the first time. Findings: The analysis using Jingdong dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is enhanced and the accuracy that instant data as input is found to be better compared with the model that lagged data as input. The root means squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed model are found to be around 11.9 and 8.23. According to the sales prediction of each product, the resource can be arranged in advance, and the marketing strategy of product positioning, product display optimization, inventory management and product promotion is designed for online stores. Originality/value: The paper proposes and implements a new model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, to predict sales of each product for online stores. Our work provides reference and enlightenment for the establishment of accurate sales-based digital marketing strategies for online stores. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Deep learning; Integration model;

Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy. In this study, we propose a model that predicts audience numbers on the opening Saturday using market research data obtained through online and offline surveys to help distributors develop better marketing strategies. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Artificial intelligence; Box office; Decision support system; Machine learning; Marketing","","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea, (2018R1D1A1A02045842)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, Republic of Korea ( 2018R1D1A1A02045842 ).

For this, the authors are using a machine learning technique in a dataset of direct marketing, which is available at IBM Watson Analytics in the IBM community. In the results, first, among all variables, customer lifetime value, coverage, employment status, income, marital status, monthly premium auto, months since last claim, months since policy inception, renew offer type, and the total claim amount is shown to influence direct marketing response. However, others have no significance. Second, for the full model, the accuracy rate is 0.864, which implies that the error rate is 0.136. Among the patients who predicted not having a direct marketing response, the accuracy that would not have a direct marketing response was 87.23%, and the accuracy that had a direct marketing response was 66.34% among the patients predicted to have a direct marketing response. © 2023 IGI Global.

We argue that the impact of prior buying on unplanned purchases is moderated by the decision frame (separate vs. integrated). We conducted a series of four sequential scenario-based experimental studies to support our theoretical predictions. Consequently, our study revealed that travelers within a separate decision frame exhibited a stronger compensatory motive, leading to a higher unplanned purchase when prior spending was low. In practice, this research has managerial implications using compensatory consumption marketing strategies. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","choice architecture; Compensatory consumption; decision frame effect; psychological marketing strategy; reference price; unplanned purchase","","","","","","","","Abrate G., Nicolau J.L., Viglia G., The impact of dynamic price variability on revenue maximization, Tourism Management, 74, pp. 224-233, (2019); Allard T., White K., Cross-domain effects of guilt on desire for self-improvement products, Journal of Consumer Research, 42, 3, pp. 401-419, (2015); Atalay A.S., Meloy M.G., Retail therapy: A strategic effort to improve mood, Psychology & Marketing, 28, 6, pp. 638-659, (2011); Badu-Baiden F., Kim S., Wong I.A., A cross-cultural multilevel investigation on memorable destination local food consumption experience and food personality traits, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 40, 4, pp. 275-293, (2023); Beatty S.E., Ferrell M.E., Impulse buying: Modeling its precursors, Journal of Retailing, 74, 2, pp. 169-191, (1998); Belk R.W., Ger G., Askegaard S., The fire of desire: A multisited inquiry into consumer passion, Journal of Consumer Research, 30, 3, pp. 326-351, (2003); Bigne E., Fuentes-Medina M.L., Morini-Marrero S., Memorable tourist experiences versus ordinary tourist experiences analysed through user-generated content, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Management, 45, pp. 309-318, (2020); Cheng Y.H., Chuang S.C., Huang M.C.J., Weng S.T., What triggers travel spending?

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method, with data collection carried out using a survey method by giving questionnaires to respondents. The respondents' criteria are active students, at least in semester three, who have studied at Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education in Indonesia, using a sampling technique with accidental sampling. Data analysis used Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling to determine the estimated results or model predictions. Findings: The results showed a significant direct effect of experiential marketing, Islamic branding and word of mouth on college decisions. There is an indirect effect between experiential marketing and Islamic branding on college decisions through word of mouth, but the word-of-mouth variable could not mediate the relationship between experiential marketing and Islamic branding on college decisions perfectly. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of the results of the study is that it uses respondents who are and have participated in learning activities on the Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education, where the Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education has added value compared to other private campuses. The added value on the Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education is the overall learning activity based on Kemuhammadiyahan Islam in Indonesia.

The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components. It was a detailed study of the current state of brand marketing strategies and customer satisfaction, found key indicators of brands that could improve customer satisfaction, and presented corresponding suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies. It shows that. It has the importance of good guidance and references to improve customer satisfaction in the industry. © 2021","Big Data; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Factor Analysis; Machine learning; Meta-combined approach","Big data; Consumer behavior; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Finance; Philosophical aspects; Sales; Strategic planning; Surveys; Behavior evaluations; Brand equity; Brand marketing; Customer perspectives; Customers' satisfaction; Equity analysis; Factors analysis; Marketing research; Marketing strategy; Meta-combined approach; Machine learning","","","","","Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China","This work was supported by Qing Lan Project, Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence (No.CM20183002) and Major Cultivating Projects of CZIMT (2019ZDXM09).","Argyris Y.A., Wang Z., Kim Y., Yin Z., The effects of visual congruence on increasing consumers’ brand engagement: An empirical investigation of influencer marketing on instagram using deep-learning algorithms for automatic image classification, Computers in Human Behavior, 112, (2020); Cui F., Hu H., Xie Y., An intelligent optimization method of E-commerce product marketing, Neural Computing & Applications, 33, pp. 4097-4110, (2021); Ezenwafor E.C., Ayodele A.A., Chukwudi Ireneus Nwaizugbo.

In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

CRM often involves a for-profit business agreeing to contribute a specified amount to a cause when the business’s customers engage in revenue-generating exchanges. Despite the central role that price is likely to play in a consumer’s decision to purchase or not to purchase an offer associated with a CRM campaign, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, very few have examined price framing effects in a CRM context. This paper aims to explore the effect of rightmost digits manipulation in prices on participation intentions for CRM campaigns. Design/methodology/approach: In Study 1, 241 college students participated in an online experiment for class credit. The experiment used a 3 (price level: low, medium and high) × 2 (price ending: 99 ending and no ending) between-subjects design. The dependent variable was participation intention, and several moderators and mediators were considered. PROCESS was used to test the moderated mediation. In Study 2, 351 subjects participated in an online experiment with a design similar to the earlier study. In Study 2, however, new mediators were added and the moderated mediation was tested using SPSS PROCESS macro. Findings: This research shows that price ending impacts the effectiveness of CRM as a tactic on consumers’ purchase intentions. Consistent with the authors’ prediction, this study shows that consumers exposed to a 99-ending CRM offer are more likely to participate in the offer compared to consumers exposed to a no-ending priced offer. Offer attractiveness, elaboration and corporate social responsibility were also shown to have a strong effect on participation intentions. Practical implications: This research indicates that for moderately priced products, 99-ending prices led to an increased influence on consumer purchase intentions; on the other hand, no-ending/even-ending prices were more effective for high-priced products. Thus, the use of the right digit effect by managers in a CRM context as way of increasing consumers’ participation likelihood is likely to be more successful for moderately priced offers. Originality/value: This research extends previous work on CRM and right digit effect in pricing. This study’s findings, in both Studies 1 and 2, demonstrate that the effectiveness of CRM campaigns on consumer choice is dependent on the offer price ending. Consumers exposed to the no-ending priced CRM offers tend to be affected less by CRM campaigns compared to consumers exposed to 99-ending offers, who perceive the offer as more attractive. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","99 ending; Cause-related marketing; Framing; Pricing; Right digit effect","","","","","","","","Adkins S., Cause Related Marketing: Who Cares Wins, (1999); Andreoni J., Giving with impure altruism: applications to charity and Ricardian equivalence, Journal of Political Economy, 97, 6, pp. 1447-1458, (1989); Andreoni J., Pure altruism and donations to public goods: a theory of warm-glow giving, The Economic Journal, 100, 401, pp. 464-477, (1990); Berger I., Cunningham P., Kozinets R., Consumer persuasion through cause related advertising, Advances in Consumer Research, 26, (1999); Bhattacharya C.B., Sen S., Consumer-company identification: a framework for understanding consumers ‘relationships with companies’, Journal of Marketing, 67, 2, pp. 76-88, (2003); Brenner G., Brenner R., Memory and markets, or why are you paying $299 for a widget?, Journal of Business, 55, 11, (1982); Brown T.J., Dacin P., The company and the product: corporate associations and consumer product responses, Journal of Marketing, 61, 1, pp. 68-84, (1997); Chang C., To donate or not to donate?

Consequently, creating an approach to predict precisely and identify churn-leading causes is a part of retention strategies in customer relationship management. The approach that has been utilized in this research to predict customer churn combines decision tree (DT) and multinomial regression (MR) to classify customers with no limitation of binary classification in the churn prediction context. A customer club dataset of a commercial bank case as a real churn problem is used in this study to benchmark the hybrid forecasting approach against its building blocks. The results showed that the hybrid forecasting approach outperformed DT and MR with an average accuracy of 87.66%, 90.74% micro-average, and 90.44% macro-average of AUC. Further analysis of the model performance per class indicated that the hybrid approach's misclassification error for the churn class decreased significantly, which is the most costly error in churn problems. Moreover, due to the structure of hybrid forecasting approach, more interoperability is obtained by assessing the impact of features in different segments, resulting in transforming them into actionable insights. The proposed approach is applied to the banking industry to prevent financial loss by detecting leading churn causes. Accordingly, after predicting the risk of customer churn, marketers and managers can determine appropriate actions that will have the most significant retention impact on each customer by applying proactive retention marketing. © World Scientific Publishing Co.","banking industry;

We contribute to the scarce research on the commercialization activities of consumer innovators by comparing the consumers’ price decisions with the pricing of firms. Our predictions build on the baseline assumption that the price decisions of consumers are influenced by the same motivations that originally prompt them to innovate. We use a sequential mixed-method approach with a quantitative main study and follow-up qualitative research. The quantitative results draw on a matched-pair analysis of 4,242 computer games released on the online game platform Steam. We find that consumer innovators charge lower prices than firms for comparable games and that consumers and firms show different inclinations in aligning prices with the games’ development costs and perceived quality. The subsequent interview study with 29 hobbyist game developers provides clear support for the motivational explanations of consumers’ pricing decisions. The findings contribute to research on consumer innovation marketing and nascent entrepreneurship. They also improve the understanding of welfare effects resulting from increasing commercial activities of consumers. © 2020","Computer games; Consumer innovators; Innovation; Marketplaces; Pricing; User innovation","Computer games; Electronic commerce; Base-line assumptions; Consumer innovations; Development costs; On-line marketplaces; Perceived quality; Pricing decision; Qualitative research; Quantitative result; Costs","","","","","Friedrich Naumann Stiftung","We acknowledge research funding from the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom for this study.

Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site. Lastly, tourism bodies and businesses could increase their partnerships with local custodians to add cultural value and understand the visitor experience. © 2020 by the authors.

To help businesses understand their current and future performance, which can help them survive and thrive in the world of e-commerce, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that conducts performance prediction and evaluation of the e-commerce industry by combining the Grey model, i.e., GM (1, 1) and data envelopment analysis, i.e., the Malmquist-I-C model. For each e-commerce company, GM (1, 1) is applied to predict future values for the period 2020–2022 and Malmquist-I-C is applied to calculate the efficiency score based on output variables such as revenue and gross profit and input variables such as assets, liabilities, and equity. The top 10 e-commerce companies in the US market are used to demonstrate model effectiveness. For the entire research period of 2016–2022, the most productive e-commerce marketplace on average was eBay, followed by Best Buy and Lowe’s; meanwhile, Groupon was the worst-performing e-commerce business during the studied period. Moreover, as most e-commerce companies have progressed in technological development, the results show that the determinants for productivity growth are the technical efficiency change indexes. That means, although focusing on technology development is the key to e-commerce success, companies should make better efforts to maximize their resources such as labor, material and equipment supplies, and capital. This paper offers decision-makers significant material for evaluating and improving their business performance. © 2020 by the authors.

While many firms focus on customer satisfaction metrics for this purpose, dual-process theories in psychology and neuroscience show that customer decisions are based on two processes. This suggests that metrics which measure the impulsiveness of purchase decisions might effectively complement customer satisfaction metrics. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics make distinct but strong predictions of consumer choices. Satisfaction and impulsiveness influence choice in different ways. While impulsiveness relates to choice directly, the satisfaction-choice path is mediated by loyalty intention. Moreover this relationship is moderated by product involvement such that impulsiveness metrics provide a better prediction for low-involvement than for high-involvement situations. Finally, a field study of 750 customers of 101 firms demonstrates these relationships at a firm level, indicating that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics have equally strong but distinct relationships with shareholder value. Therefore firms may be able to benefit from complementing customer satisfaction metrics with customer impulsiveness metrics. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.","Customer metrics; Customer satisfaction; Financial impact; Impulsiveness","","","","","","Robert H.

Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance. Most customer segmentation approaches based on customer value fail to account for the factor of time and the trend of value changes in their analysis. In this article, we classify customers based on their value using the RFM model and K-means clustering method. Then, an assessment of changes over several periods of time is carried out. The originality of this research lies in its incorporation of time and trend of customer value changes in improving the accuracy of predictions based on the past behavior of customers. For this purpose, we used the POS customer transactions. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Customer lifetime value; RFM model; Segmentation; Temporal data mining","","","","","","","","Bauer C.L., A direct mail customer purchase model, Journal of Direct Marketing, 2, 3, pp. 16-24, (1988); Berson A., Smith S., Thearling K., Building Data Mining Applications for CRM, (1999); Bose I., Chen X., Quantitative models for direct marketing: A review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Bottcher M., Hoppner F., Spiliopoulou M., On exploiting the power of time in data mining, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 10, 2, pp. 3-11, (2008); Bottcher M., Spott M., Nauck D., Kruse R., Mining changing customer segments in dynamic markets, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 1, pp. 155-164, (2009); Bramer M., Principles of Data Mining, 131, (2007); Chang H.-C., Tsai H.-P., Group RFM analysis as a novel framework to discover better customer consumption behavior, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 12, pp. 14499-14513, (2011); Chang H.H., Tsay S.F., Integrating of SOM and K-Mean in data mining clustering: An empirical study of CRM and profitability evaluation, Journal of Information Management, 11, 4, pp. 161-203, (2004); Chen M.-C., Chiu A.-L., Chang H.-H., Mining changes in customer behavior in retail marketing, Expert Systems with Applications, 28, 4, pp. 773-781, (2005); Cheng C.-H., Chen Y.-S., Classifying the segmentation of customer value via RFM model and RS theory, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3, pp. 4176-4184, (2009); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Morison R., Analytics at Work: Smarter Decisions, Better Results, (2010); Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques: Concepts and Techniques, (2011); Hosseini S.M.S., Maleki A., Gholamian M.R., Cluster analysis using data mining approach to develop CRM methodology to assess the customer loyalty, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 5259-5264, (2010); Hu Y.-H., Huang T.C., Kao Y.-H., Knowledge discovery of weighted RFM sequential patterns from customer sequence databases, Journal of Systems and Software, 86, 3, pp. 779-788, (2013); Huang T.C., Mining the change of customer behavior in fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns, Applied Soft Computing, 12, 3, pp. 1068-1086, (2012); Hughes A., Strategic Database Marketing, (1994); Hwang H., Jung T., Suh E., An LTV model and customer segmentation based on customer value: A case study on the wireless telecommunication industry, Expert Systems with Applications, 26, 2, pp. 181-188, (2004); Kim S.-Y., Jung T.-S., Suh E.-H., Hwang H.-S., Customer segmentation and strategy development based on customer lifetime value: A case study, Expert Systems with Applications, 31, 1, pp. 101-107, (2006); Kotler P., Marketing Management, (2001); Yen D.C., Customer relationship management: An analysis framework and implementation strategies, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 41, 3, pp. 82-97, (2001); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Integrating AHP and data mining for product recommendation based on customer lifetime value, Information & Management, 42, 3, pp. 387-400, (2005); Marcus C., A practical yet meaningful approach to customer segmentation, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 15, 5, pp. 494-504, (1998); Roddick J.F., Spiliopoulou M., A survey of temporal knowledge discovery paradigms and methods, Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions On, 14, 4, pp. 750-767, (2002); Song H.S., Kim S.H., Mining the change of customer behavior in an internet shopping mall, Expert Systems with Applications, 21, 3, pp. 157-168, (2001); Stone B., Successful Direct Marketing Methods, NTC Business Books, pp. 37-57, (1995); Tsai C.-Y., Chiu C.-C., A purchase-based market segmentation methodology, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, 2, pp. 265-276, (2004); Turban E., Sharda R., Aronson J.E., King D.N., Business Intelligence: a Managerial Approach, (2008); Verhoef P.C., Spring P.N., Hoekstra J.C., Leeflang P.S.H., The commercial use of segmentation and predictive modeling techniques for database marketing in the Netherlands, Decision Support Systems, 34, 4, pp. 471-481, (2003); Wei J.-T., Lin S.-Y., Wu H.-H., A review of the application of RFM model, African Journal of Business Management, 4, 19, pp. 4199-4206, (2010)","M.

Although prior studies generally agree on the importance of online WOM, we have little knowledge of the interplay between online user reviews and professional reviews. This paper empirically investigates a mediation model in which online user reviews mediate the impact of professional reviews on online user decisions. Using software download data, we show that a higher professional rating not only directly promotes software download but also results in more active user-generated WOM interactions, which indirectly lead to more downloads. The indirect impact of professional reviews can be as large as 20 percent of the corresponding total impact. These findings deepen our understanding of online WOM effect, and provide managerial suggestions about WOM marketing and the prediction of online user choices.

Previous research has used across-chain scanner panel data to develop optimal price cuts targeted to individual households but whether such a targeting strategy will work with only within-chain data is unknown. The purpose of this research is to address this specific question. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use scanner panel data from multiple categories to create across-chain and within-chain purchase histories for the same consumers. They then estimate models of purchase decisions on the two datasets and compare their performance. Findings: Within-chain data fares significantly worse on both fit and prediction criteria. Retailers' upside to customizing is minimal compared to those reported for manufacturers. Finally, customized prices based on the within-chain model significantly underperform the promise of across-chain data. Research limitations/implications: Store choice is not modelled. Research also needs to be replicated in other contexts. The authors conclude that limited purchase histories may not yield accurate enough estimates of marketing mix responsiveness, and that across-chain purchase histories are essential for effective targeted price cuts. Practical implications: Loyalty card data may be useful for other purposes, like experimenting with segment-specific discounts, but its value in customizing prices at individual level is limited without adding other sources of information. Originality/value: Previous research on price customization has been based almost exclusively on across-store data. However, retailers only have access to their own chain-specific data. This is the first study to comprehensively compare price customization based on within- and across-chain purchase data and show that the upside potential for price customization based on the former information set is quite limited. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","and quantity models; choice; Incidence; Loyalty cards; Retailing; Scanner panel data; Targeted price cuts","","","","","","University of Southern California","","Ailawadi K.L., Neslin S.A., The effect of promotion on consumption: Buying more and consuming it faster, Journal of Marketing Research, 35, 3, pp. 390-398, (1998); Andrews R.L., Ainslie A., Currim I.S., An empirical comparison of logit choice models with discrete versus continuous representations of heterogeneity, Journal of Marketing Research, 39, 4, pp. 479-487, (2002); Basuroy S., Mantrala M.K., Walters R.G., The impact of category management on retailer prices and performance: Theory and evidence, Journal of Marketing, 65, 4, pp. 16-32, (2001); Bronnenberg B.J., Kruger M.J., Mela C.F., The IRI marketing data set, Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 745-748, (2008); Bucklin R.E., Lattin J.M., A model of product category competition among grocery retailers, Journal of Retailing, 68, 3, pp. 271-293, (1992); Bucklin R.E., Gupta S., Siddarth S., Determining segmentation in sales response across consumer purchase behaviors, Journal of Marketing Research, 35, 2, pp. 189-197, (1998); Dube J.-P., Hitsch G.J., Rossi P.E., Vitorino M.A., Category pricing with state-dependent utility, Marketing Science, 27, 3, pp. 417-429, (2008); Ghitelman D., Category management key to rebuilding retail business, Supermarket News, 51, 26, (2003); Grewal D., Ailawadi K., Gauri D., Hall K., Kopalle P., Robertson J., Innovations in retail pricing and promotions, Journal of Retailing, 87, 1, (2011); Gupta S., Impact of sales promotions on when, what, and how much to buy, Journal of Marketing Research, 25, 4, pp. 342-355, (1988); Iyengar R., Ansari A., Gupta S., Leveraging information across categories, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, 1, 4, pp. 425-465, (2003); Meyer-Waarden L., The effects of loyalty programs on customer lifetime duration and share of wallet, Journal of Retailing, 83, 2, pp. 223-236, (2007); Pancras J., Sudhir K., Optimal marketing strategies for a customer data intermediary, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 4, pp. 560-578, (2007); Park Y.-H., Fader P.S., Modeling browsing behavior at multiple web sites, Marketing Science, 23, 3, pp. 280-303, (2004); Rossi P.E., McCulloch R.E., Allenby G.M., The value of purchase history data in target marketing, Marketing Science, 15, 4, pp. 321-340, (1996); Rubiano S.A., Some supermarket shoppers object to personal nature of using loyalty cards, The Indianapolis Star, (2004); Sharp B., Sharp A., Loyalty programs and their impact on repeat-purchase loyalty patterns, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 14, pp. 473-486, (1997); Tellis G.J., Zufryden F.S., Tackling the retailer decision maze: Which brands to discount, how much, when and why?, Marketing Science, 14, 3, pp. 271-299, (1995); van Heerde H.J., Gupta S., Wittink D.R., Is 75 percent of the sales promotion bump due to brand switching?

In this article, an interdisciplinary approach is utilized to investigate this successful rate of adoption. Diffusion of innovation theory as well as services marketing theory and recent research on adoption of technology are integrated into the theoretical approach. The data gathering is twofold: a survey on the perceived attributes of the innovation was carried out and document data were gathered from government sources. This study shows that a 100 per cent rate of adoption can be achieved with (1) negative perception of the attributes of the innovation; (2) an authority innovation-decision; (3) use of mass communication and interpersonal communication channels; (4) communication in social networks that are not interconnected; and (5) active change agents on a comprehensive and large scale.

Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed. The proposed model can be applied as an effective decision-support tool for green building pricing and formulating marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Consumer behavior; Decision-support model; Green building; Price premium","","","","","","","","Ali H.H., Al Nsairat S.F., Developing a green building assessment tool for developing countries–Case of Jordan, Building and Environment, 44, 5, pp. 1053-1064, (2009); Attalla M., Hegazy T., Predicting cost deviation in reconstruction projects: Artificial neural networks versus regression, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 129, 4, pp. 405-411, (2003); Building Research Establishment Global, (2008); Chan E.H., Qian Q.K., Lam P.T., The market for green building in developed Asian cities—The perspectives of building designers, Energy Policy, 37, 8, pp. 3061-3070, (2009); Chau C.K., Tse M.S., Chung K.Y., A choice experiment to estimate the effect of green experience on preferences and willingness-to-pay for green building attributes, Building and Environment, 45, 11, pp. 2553-2561, (2010); Cheng C.L., Evaluating water conservation measures for Green Building in Taiwan, Building and Environment, 38, 2, pp. 369-379, (2003); Council, U.

Unlike most research focused on individual consumption, this study takes a broader perspective on joint consumption. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework and the developed research questions are based on an extensive literature review. Findings – This research identifies five major challenges for group decisions: allocation of responsibilities, preference prediction, preference aggregation, conflicts and mutual influences. For each challenge, this study summarizes existing findings and highlights important areas for continued investigation, related to a marketing-oriented understanding of consumers. This article concludes with implications for both managers and researchers. Originality/value – The identified key determinants of group decisions aggregate findings from multidisciplinary literature and can help marketing researchers and managers understand the relevant but underresearched issues of decision making in groups. Furthermore, this study includes relevant moderators, such as individual and group characteristics, and reveals problematic research gaps. In turn, it offers questions and ideas for additional research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Group consumer behavior; Group decision; Joint consumption","","","","","","","","Adamowicz W., Hanemann M., Swait J., Johnson R., Layton D., Regenwetter M., Reimer T., Sorkin R., Decision strategy and structure in households: A ‘groups’ perspective, Marketing Letters, 16, 3, pp. 387-399, (2005); Alba J.W., Hutchinson J.W., Knowledge calibration: What consumers know and what they think they know, Journal of Consumer Research, 27, 2, pp. 123-156, (2000); Aribarg A., Arora N., Kang M.Y., Predicting joint choice using individual data, Marketing Science, 29, 1, pp. 139-157, (2010); Austin B.A., Immediate Seating – a Look at Movie Audiences, (1989); Bagozzi R.P., On the concept of intentional social action in consumer behavior, Journal of Consumer Research, 27, 3, pp. 388-396, (2000); Bagozzi R.P., Socializing marketing, Marketing ZFP – Journal of Research and Management, 27, 2e, pp. 101-111, (2005); Bagozzi R.P., Alternative approaches for thinking about and modeling consumer decisions in relationships, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 22, 3, pp. 315-319, (2012); Barsade S.G., The ripple effect: Emotional contagion and its influence on group behavior, Administrative Science Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 644-677, (2002); Batson C.D., Powell A.A., Altruism and prosocial behavior, Handbook of Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology, 5, pp. 463-484, (2003); Bearden W.O., Netemeyer R.G., Teel J.E., Measurement of consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence, Journal of Consumer Research, 15, 4, pp. 473-481, (1989); Beatty S.E., Talpade S., Adolescent influence in family decision making: A replication with extension, Journal of Consumer Research, 21, 2, pp. 332-341, (1994); Belch M.A., Willis L.A., Family decision at the turn of the century: Has the changing structure of households impacted the family decision-making process?, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 2, 2, pp. 111-124, (2001); Belk R., Sharing, Journal of Consumer Research, 36, 5, pp. 715-734, (2010); Belk R.W., Coon G.S., Gift giving as agapic love: An alternative to the exchange paradigm based on dating experiences, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 3, pp. 393-417, (1993); Bettman J.R., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Constructive consumer choice processes, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 3, pp. 187-217, (1998); Blood R.O., Wolfe D.M., Husbands and Wives: The Dynamics of Married Living,, (1960); Bodapati A.V., Recommendation systems with purchase data, Journal of Marketing Research, 45, 1, pp. 77-93, (2008); Bohlmann J.D., Rosa J.A., Bolton R.N., Qualls W.J., The effect of group interactions on satisfaction judgments: Satisfaction escalation, Marketing Science, 25, 4, pp. 301-321, (2006); Bonds-Raacke J.M., Using cluster analysis to examine husband-wife decision making, Psychological Record, 56, 4, pp. 521-550, (2006); Bretherton I., Attachment theory: Retrospect and prospect, Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50, 1-2, pp. 3-35, (1985); Brewer M.B., Gardner W., Who is this ‘we’?

This paper proposes decision costs as one explanation: whether a person buys at a price depends on whether she carefully considers the offer, which itself depends on price. A simple model predicts that deliberation costs (1) increase sensitivity to low prices; (2) can prevent cost-sharing from targeting products to buyers with high value; and (3) can have larger effects on poorer people. The principal contribution of this paper is a field experiment that sold hand-washing soap in rural India. Participants were randomly assigned to be offered soap for either a low or very low price, which was experimentally crossed with assignment to a control group or to a treatment that required deliberation. Results matched predictions of the model: the treatment decreased price sensitivity relative to the control group, and increased targeting of product take-up by need. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral economics; Cognitive limits; Cost sharing; Deliberation costs; Development economics; Field experiment; Handwashing with soap; Pricing; Social marketing","","","","","","","","Banerjee A., Mullainathan S., Limited Attention and Income Distribution.

In the meantime, many organizational purchase decisions are structured around which independent supplier to buy from, rather than a typical make-or-buy decision. This study extends existing research on TCA by applying this theoretical framework to explore why organizational buyers make purchases from among independent suppliers. The article posits that (1) two forms of relationship governance—buyer trust and market (i.e., the relative dependence between the buyer and supplier)—help explain the differences in buyer decision-making uncertainty involving independent suppliers, which further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase; and that (2) trust further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase due to its effect on customer perceived value. The empirical study based on organizational purchasing decisions lends support to the predictions of the relationship governance theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","business-to-business marketing;

When the data generating process differs from the assumed distribution, the resulting model is misspecified. To hedge against such a misspecification risk, the extant theory recommends using the sandwich estimator. This approach, however, only corrects the variance of estimated parameters, but not their values. Consequently, the sandwich estimator does not affect any managerial outcomes such as marketing budgeting and allocation decisions. To overcome this drawback, we present the minimax framework that does not necessitate distributional assumptions to estimate dynamic models. Applying minimax control theory, we derive an optimal robust filter, illustrate its application to a unique advertising data set from the Canadian Blood Services, and contribute several novel findings. We discover the compensatory effect: Advertising effectiveness increases and the carryover effect decreases as robustness increases. We also find that the robust filter uniformly outperforms the Kalman filter on the out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we uncover the existence of a profit-volatility trade-off, similar to the returns-risk trade-off in finance, whereby the volatility of profit stream decreases at the expense of reduced total profit as robustness increases. Finally, we prove that, unlike for-profit companies, managers of nonprofit organizations should optimally allocate budgets opposite the advertising-to-sales ratio heuristic; that is, advertise more (less) when sales are low (high). © 2017 INFORMS.","Dynamic games; Kalman filter; Nonprofit marketing; Optimal control; Robust estimation; Sandwich estimator","","","","","","University of California, Irvine University of Michigan; McGill University, MGU; Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, RU; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, EPFL; Tsinghua University, THU","The authors thank seminar participants at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, McGill University, Rutgers University, Tsinghua University, the University of California Davis Statistics Department, University of Alberta, University of California, Irvine University of Michigan, and University of South Carolina for their helpful suggestions.

Responses from 284 Arizona farmers and ranchers were used to examine (i) the importance producers placed on different types of weather data for production and marketing decisions; (ii) which producer characteristics accounted for differences in the importance they placed on weather data; (iii) producer use of weather data for specific production and marketing decisions; and (iv) which factors distinguish weather data users from nonusers.Amodel of demand for weather information was developed and used to specify count data and discrete choice multivariate regression models. The intensity of weather data use was greater among producers with diversified agricultural production. Diversified producers were more likely to use data for timing of planting, cultivation, and harvest. Weather data use was lower among producers with greater reliance on off-farm income. Producers who rated government risk-management programs as important also found more weather data types important and used weather data for more decisions.

Second, it will attempt to compare the differing opinions different customers from several countries possess. Finally, it is to relate, link and model the influence these opinions may have on the country selection made by the tourist. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is drawn from a sample of approximately 1,600 customers/tourists who visited Crete island. Those in the sample were from ten different countries of origin. The research attempts to shed some light on the importance of travellers' beliefs by using the multinomial logistic model that tested whether it can produce results for prediction and comparisons. Findings – Results suggest that tourist beliefs can be categorized in three factors, namely country's characteristics, tradition and hygiene that are differentiated among nationality groups. No robust support is provided for any relationship between travellers' values and country selection and thus arguing for further research in tourism marketing and policy. Practical implications – By using the findings of this work, hotel managers and tour operators can identify the multicultural diversity of international tourists. Originality/value – This work addresses the ways with which customers by using their personal beliefs select destinations (countries). It diverts from the mainstream relevant literature that focuses almost solely on the level of satisfaction or the level of service the customer enjoys. One of the issues that remains rather neglected is the importance that personal characteristics and attributes of the tourist/customer influence the final decision on where to spend his/her holidays. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Greece; Personal beliefs; Tourism marketing; Values","","","","","","","","Ahmed Z.U., Johnson J.P., Country-of-origin and brand effects on consumers' evaluations of cruise lines, International Marketing Review, 19, 3, pp. 279-302, (2001); Ahmed Z.V., Krohn F., Understanding the unique consumer behavior of Japanese tourists, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 1, 3, pp. 73-86, (1992); Argyle M., Henderson M., Bond M., Iizuka Y., Contarello A., Cross-cultural variations in relationships rules, International Journal of Psychology, 21, pp. 287-315, (1986); Atkinson A., Answering the eternal question: what does the customer want?, The Cornell Hotel & Restaurant Administration Quarterly, August, pp. 12-14, (1988); Baloglu S., McCleary K.W., US international pleasure travelers' images of four Mediterranean destinations: a comparison of visitors and nonvisitors, Journal of Travel Research, 38, 2, pp. 144-152, (1999); Bauer T., Jago L., Wise B., The changing demand for hotel facilities in the Asia Pacific region, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 12, 4, pp. 313-322, (1993); Baum T., Images of tourism past and present, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 8, 4, pp. 25-30, (1996); Brown A., The UK Environment, (1992); Burton S., The framing of purchase for services, The Journal of Services Marketing, 4, Fall, pp. 55-67, (1990); Carman J.M., Values and consumption patterns: closed loop, Advances in Consumer Research, pp. 403-407, (1977); Choi Y.T., Chu R., Levels of satisfaction among Asian and Western travellers, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 17, 2, pp. 116-131, (2000); Chon K., Tourism destination image modification process, Tourism Management, March, pp. 68-72, (1991); Donthu N., Cherian J., Impact of strength of ethnic identification on Hispanic shopping behaviour, Journal of Retailing, 70, Winter, pp. 383-394, (1994); Dritsakis N., An Economic Analysis of Foreign Tourism to Greece, (1995); Eroglu S.A., Machleit K.A., Effects of individual and product-specific variables on utilising country of origin as a product quality cue, International Marketing Review, 6, 6, pp. 27-52, (1989); Font X., Walmsley A., Cogotti S., McCombes L., Hausler N., Corporate social responsibility: the disclosure-performance gap, Tourism Management, 33, pp. 1544-1553, (2012); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, 1, pp. 39-50, (1981); Frias D.M., Rodriguez M.A., Castaneda J.A., Sabiote1 C.M., Buhalis D., The formation of a tourist destination's image via information sources: the moderating effect of culture, International Journal of Tourism Research, 14, 5, pp. 437-450, (2012); Green T.J., TQM and organisational culture: how do they link?, Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, 23, 2, pp. 141-157, (2012); Gimenez-Espin J.A., Jimenez-Jimenez D., Martinez-Costa M., Organizational culture for total quality management, Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, pp. 1-15, (2012); Gyimothy S., Odysseys: analysing service journeys from the customer's perspective, Managing Service Quality, 10, 6, pp. 389-396, (2000); Hall M.C., Weiler B., What's special about special interest tourism?, Special Interest Tourism, Weiler and Hall, (1992); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values, (1980); Homer P.M., Kahle L.R., A structural equation test of the value-attitude-behaviour hierarchy, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54, 4, pp. 638-646, (1988); Hoon Y., Honey, I shrunk the budget, PATA Travel News, October, (1992); Hudson S., Hudson P., Miller G.A., The measurement of service quality in the tour operating sector: a methodological comparison, Journal of Travel Research, 42, 3, pp. 305-312, (2004); Ilbery B., Kneafsey M., Product and place: promoting quality products and services in the lagging rural regions of the European Union, European Urban and Regional Studies, 5, pp. 329-341, (1998); Ingelsson P., Eriksson M., Lilja J., Can selecting the right values help TQM implementation?

Despite its economic impact on the sport industry, relatively few studies have examined phenomena associated with March Madness bracketology. The few existing studies have focused on making accurate tournament predictions rather than examining bracketology in ways that might assist sport marketers. To fill this void, the current study applied loss aversion theory to the decision-making process of NCAA tournament bracket participants. The purpose of the study was to develop a framework for understanding how emotional loss aversion might influence the decision of highly and lowly identified fans to choose against one's favorite team when it is likely to lose the game. © 2017, © 2017 Global Alliance of Marketing & Management Associations (GAMMA).","loss aversion; NCAA Men's Basketball Championship; sport fan emotion; sport marketing; team identification","","","","","","","","Abdellaoui M., Bleichrodt H., Paraschiv C., Loss aversion under prospect theory: A parameter-free measurement, Management Science, 53, pp. 1659-1674, (2007); Bagozzi R.P., Baumgartner H., Pieters R., Goal-directed emotions, Cognition and Emotion, 12, pp. 1-26, (1998); Baumgartner H., Pieters R., Bagozzi R.P., Future-oriented emotions: Conceptualization and behavioral effects, European Journal of Social Psychology, 38, pp. 685-696, (2008); Biggest sports betting event?

The decision to pay these dividends to shareholders concerns several other groups of people, such as financial managers, consulting firms, individual and institutional investors, government and monitoring authorities, and creditors, just to name a few. The prediction and modelling of this decision has received a significant amount of attention in the corporate finance literature. However, the methods used to study the aforementioned question are limited to the logistic regression method without any implementation of the advanced and expert methods of data mining. These methods have proven their superiority in other business-related fields, such as marketing, production, accounting and auditing. In finance, bankruptcy prediction has the vast majority among data-mining implementations, but to the best of the authors’ knowledge such an implementation does not exist in dividend payment prediction. This paper satisfies this gap in the literature and provides answers that help to understand the so-called ‘dividend puzzle’. Specifically, this paper provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that data-mining methods perform better in accuracy measures against the traditional methods used. The prediction of dividend policy determinants provides valuable benefits to all related parties, as they can manage, invest, consult and monitor the dividend policy in a more effective way.

The general theory of behavioral strategy includes a set of tenets that describes alternative configurations of decision processes and objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments associating with different outcomes involving specific price-points. This article explicates these tenets and discusses empirical studies which support the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytical tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, ethnographic decision-tree-modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis). The general theory of behavioral pricing involves the blending of cognitive science, complexity theory, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices. Consequently, behavioral pricing theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only price-setting. Capturing and reporting contextually-driven alternative routines to price setting by a compelling set of tenets represent what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory. The general theory serves as a useful foundation for advances in pricing theory and improving pricing practice. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioral; Configuration; Empiricism; Pricing; Theory","","","","","","","","Bazerman M.H., Moore D., Judgment in managerial decision making, (2008); Byrne D., Complexity theory and the social sciences, (1998); Byrne D., Complexity, configurations and cases, Theory, Culture and Society, 22, 5, pp. 95-111, (2005); Cyert R.M., March J.G., A behavioral theory of the firm, (1963); Davis J.P., Eisenhardt K.M., Bingham C.B., Optimal structure, market dynamism, and the strategy of simple rules, Administrative Science Quarterly, 54, pp. 413-452, (2009); Eichenwald K., The informant, (2001); Fishburn P.C., Lexicographic orders, utilities and decision rules: A survey, Management Science, 20, pp. 1442-1471, (1974); Fiss P., Building better causal theories: A fuzzy set approach to typologies in organization research, Academy of Management Journal, 54, pp. 393-420, (2011); Fitzsimons G.J., Death to dichotomizing, Journal of Consumer Research, 35, 1, pp. 5-8, (2008); Friedman M., The methodology of positive economics, Essays in positive economics, (1966); Tacit knowledge; Gendler T.S., Galileo and the indispensability of scientific thought Experiment, The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 49, pp. 397-424, (1998); Gigerenzer G., From tools to theories: A heuristic of discovery in cognitive psychology, Psychological Review, 98, pp. 254-267, (1991); Gigerenzer G., Brighton H., Homo heuristicus: Why biased minds make better inferences, Topics in Cognitive Science, 1, pp. 107-143, (2009); Bounded rationality: The adaptive toolbox, (2001); Gigerenzer G., Todd P.M., Simple heuristics that make us smart, (1999); Gladwell M., The tipping point, (2002); Gladwin C.H., The role of a cognitive anthropologist in a farming systems program which has everything, The role of anthropologists and other social scientists in interdisciplinary teams developing improved food production technology, Los Banos, the Philippines: IRRI, (1982); Gladwin C.H., Contributions of decision tree methodology to a farming systems program, Human Organization, 42, 2, pp. 146-157, (1983); Gladwin C.H., Ethnographic decision tree modeling, (1989); Gladwin C., A theory of real-life choice: Applications to agricultural decisions, Agricultural decision making: Anthropology contributions to rural development, (1980); Howard J.A., Morgenroth W.M., Information processing model of executive decision, Management Science, 14, pp. 416-428, (1968); Joskow P.L., Email correspondence with Arch G.

A significant body of the literature has been dedicated to the first two components, and in particular, to purchase/non-purchase prediction modelling. However, in the current paper, we do not address these two components, but rather we focus on the third component. To this end, data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique and particularly cross-efficiency formulation of the best practice frontier Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) (Charnes et al., 1978) (BPF-CCR) is used to determine those customers who should be put on the first priorities of marketing mailing list. In addition, the cross-efficiency formulation of worst practice frontier CCR (WPF-CCR) is developed to exclude the worst customers from mailing list and save the mailing expenses for the best practice ones. Using a numerical example, the application of the proposed model is demonstrated.

Citrus farmers are not informed about expected prices. This information is crucial to make business decisions. For the farmers is necessary to take into account the spatial and temporal arbitrage of citrus harvest and storage, which may improve citrus farmer's position in marketing chain and reduce the influence of intermediaries. The aim of the paper is to verify using of SARIMA models as a tool of Agricultural Marketing Information System for citrus price forecasting in Lattakia region, R. A. Syria. The SARIMA model were tested for citrus wholesale prices prediction at Lattakia market in the paper. SARIMA model was applied on the empirical data, obtained from the actual Marketing Information System in the Lattakia Region. Results showed that SARIMA model (2,1,0) (1,0,1)12 is suitable for seasonal prices prediction. This method is suitable to be part of AMIS. The data was processed in software Minitab.","Citrus fruits; Decision-making; Lattakia; Marketing information system; SARIMA model; Syria","Ladhiqiyah; Latakia; Syrian Arab Republic; Citrus; agricultural market; decision making; empirical analysis; fruit; information system; marketing; numerical model; price determination","","","","","","","Adanacioglu H., Yercan M., An analysis of tomato prices at wholesale level in Turkey: an application of SARIMA model, 8, 4, pp. 52-75, (2012); Aker J., Mbiti I., Mobile phones and economic development in Africa, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24, 3, pp. 207-232, (2010); Box G.E.P., Jenkins G.M., Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, reviseded Holden-Day, (1970); (2012); Chandran K.P., Pandey N.K., Potato price forecasting using seasonal ARIMA approach, Potato Journal, 34, pp. 137-138, (2007); Chuan W., Junye Z., Min H., Measurement of the Fluctuation Risk of the China Fruit Market Price based on VaR, 1, pp. 212-218, (2010); Csoto M., Information flow in agriculture - through new channels for improved effectiveness, Journal of Agricultural Informatics, 1, 2, pp. 25-34, (2010); Deepak M.P., Gopal B.T., Are marketing intermediaries exploiting mountain farmers in Nepal A study based on market price, marketing margin and income distribution analyses, Agricultural Systems, 94, 2, pp. 151-164, (2007); Dinar A., Extension Commercialization: How much to charge for extension services, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 78, 1, pp. 1-12, (1996); Felipe dos I.J.S., Mol A.L.R., Almeida de V.S., Brito de M.C., Application of ARIMA models in soybean series of prices in the north of Paraná, 8, pp. 78-91, (2012); Hossain M.Z., Samad Q.A., Ali M.Z., ARIMA model and forecasting with three types of pulse prices in Bangladesh: A case study, Int.

On one hand, it presents opportunity for manufacturers and sellers to be highlighted for their good work, but at the same time, there remains a possibility of negative review impacting goodwill and reputation. Hence, it is important for managers to identify factors that impact consumers’ intentions to write online reviews. This research delves into this aspect by trying to identify the factors that impact reviews writing intentions of consumers for restaurants. The study extends the theory of planned behaviour with additions of variables such as ego involvement, taking vengeance and helping a restaurant. For this, 252 valid responses were obtained, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. Results indicate that perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, ego involvement and taking vengeance are significant predictors of intention to write online reviews for the restaurants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behaviour; E-WOM; Intentions to write online reviews; Theory of planned behaviour","consumption behavior; integrated approach; marketing; modeling; prediction; retailing","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organ.

Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profit. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible. The prediction results of M-GFDT and the method itself are useful for helping advertisers to optimize their ad strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filter; Online ads","Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Trees (mathematics); Tunneling (excavation); Decision tree classifiers; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filters; High-accuracy; Marketing message; Online ads; Potential customers; Two-stage methods; Pulse shaping circuits","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, (2018A030313795); National Nature Science Foundation of China, (71731006); Scientific and Technological Projects of Tianhe District of Guangzhou, (2018CX007)","This research was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 71731006; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, Grant No. 2018A030313795; and Scientific and Technological Projects of Tianhe District of Guangzhou, Grant No. 2018CX007.

The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer’s personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers’ communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents. Theoretical implications of the findings request questioning the use of the personality traits as an interim stage in decision-making predictions. In addition, these findings fill the gap in the field of communication preference based on personality traits and personality estimators. The data set has been previously used for the doctoral thesis research. For the purpose of this research, data was re-coded and analyzed using different approach, namely binomial logistic regression. © 2018, Technical University of Liberec.

In most of the Asian countries, it is a challenging task to perform EDM due to the diverse characteristics of the educational data. In this study, we have performed students’ educational performance prediction, pattern analysis and proposed a generalized framework to perform rigorous educational analytics. To validate our proposed framework, we have also conducted extensive experiments on a real-world dataset that has been prepared by the transcript data of the students from the Marketing department of a renowned university in Bangladesh. We have applied six state-of-the-art classification algorithms on our dataset for the prediction task where the Random Forest model outperforms the other models with accuracy 94.1%.

Drawing on institutional theory, we develop predictions that link the use of performance measures to the influence of functional subunits in strategic decision making. Our research model tests the effects of two types of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence: (1) decision-facilitating use and (2) use for accountability. Moreover, we propose that the effects of using performance measures for these two purposes depend on the reliability and functional specificity of the measures the functional subunits use. We empirically test our hypotheses and a research question with survey data from 192 marketing directors of German firms. We find that the effect of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence depends on the two properties of the performance measures. We find no significant effects when these properties are not considered. However, decision-facilitating use of performance measures has a positive effect on functional strategic decision influence when the measures are specific to the functional subunit. With respect to the use of performance measures for accountability we find countervailing effects, as the effect on functional strategic decision influence is positive when the measures are more reliable but negative when they are more specific to the functional subunit. We discuss these findings in light of existing evidence and theory. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Abernethy M.A., Bouwens J., van Lent L., Determinants of control system design in divisionalized firms, The Accounting Review, 79, pp. 545-570, (2004);

This study aims to determine the determinants of prices in top-quality wine market. The authors also seek to estimate the role for country of origin, grape, producing region and winery in prices. And, finally, the authors try to show how countries, regions and wineries can help increase their position in international rankings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors try to answer: What factors explain the price of top-quality wines (defined as best rated in a standardized ranking)? To some extent, in the hands of producers influence prices, which imply long-term decisions or large investments in land and marketing. Other variables that consumer value does affect prices. The authors try also to detect undervalued or overvalued wines, grapes, regions, wineries or producer countries. The authors estimate an econometric model of hedonic prices using a 14-year sample of the Wine Spectator’s 100 top-rated wines for the American market between 2003 and 2016, totaling 1,400 observations. The sample is a great cross-section because each wine is unique. Findings: The authors’ contribution is twofold: the determination of the price explanatory values and the identification and attribution of price differences by country, grape, region and winery. Also, the authors detected grapes, countries, regions and wineries which are overvalued or undervalued with respect to the average prediction of the model. Research limitations/implications: The findings are useful to understand the role of price explanatory variables, as well as for making policy and managerial decisions. From the model, collective or managerial actions can be derived to increase particular wines’ positions in international rankings. The proxy for “quality” in the study is not the only possible definition. Practical implications: In some cases, managerial choices could be conditioned by the policies or history. There is some room for collective action and public policies to improve regions’ and countries’ reputation. Social implications: There are clear synergies for policies that can raise the prestige of countries and regions and their spillovers on the brand name reputation of individual wineries. Originality/value: The results, policy and managerial implications are of interest for business, countries interested in improving their position in international rankings and for consumers to make more informed decisions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Econometric model; Economic sectors; Economics; Hedonic model; Pricing; Quality assessment; Quality ratings; Wine prices","","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas","Universidad del Centro de Estudios Macroeconomicos de Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and","Berrios R., Saens R., (2012); Bicknell K., Friesen L., MacDonald I., A hedonic price analysis for the New Zealand wine industry: preliminary result, (2005); Bombrun H., Sumner D.A., What Determines the Price of Wine?

We find customer experience (CX) to be important in improving attribution outcomes (e.g., conversion rates) by combining clickstream and survey data to understand consumers’ decision processes.

The scientific forecasting on the total value of imports and exports of top traded commodities in Taiwan are needed as the essential inputs to determine whether new top traded commodities should be imported or exported, and to make right decision toward activities in various functional areas such as building new container terminals, operation plans, marketing strategies, as well as finance and accounting [1]. Taking the original data of the amount of import and export commodity during the years from 2007 to 2013, the author tries to establish a mathematical model of Grey forecasting to make a prediction of the total value of imports and exports of top commodities in Taiwan for the next 05 coming years from 2014 to 2018. The analysis results show that the usage of Grey forecasting models resulted in a very low mean absolute percentage error, which demonstrate its applicability in practice to provide accurate forecasts. This research also indicates that for the future period of time (2014-2017), there will be a steady increase in both exports and imports value of all top commodities. The current study may offer a good idea for the control and scheduling for the terminal operators in decision making and planning. © 2019, International Journal of Analysis and Applications.

On the one hand, the creation of companies can be an effective solution of the unemployment. On the other hand, business development is an essential factor of economic growth. Thus, the development of a country is correlated with its business development. However, business results are not always guaranteed. For this reason, controlling a number of factors related to results is an absolute necessity. Our research aims at studying a set of elements contributing to the results of the success and failure of Turkish companies. For this purpose, we considered a sample of 46 companies, which is subdivided into two sub-samples, the first represents the “Successful companies ""; this category represents 74% of the total sample. The second represents the remaining 26% formed the “Failure companies”. Empirical results highlight the importance of factors related to; the Business plan, the innovation, the marketing strategy, and the human resources. However, ignoring these factors lead to the business failure. Therefore, the prediction of success or failure factors will deliver key information to decision-makers on the mistakes to be avoided and the precautions to be taken. © BEIESP.","Business plan; Failure; Human Research; Innovation; Marketing; Success; Turkish Companies","","","","","","","","Achanga P., Shehab E., Roy R., Nelder G., Critical success factors for lean implementation in SMEs, Journal of Manufaeturing Teehnology Management, 17, 4, pp. 460-471, (2006); Ashley D.B., Lurie C.S., Jaselskis E.J., Determinants of Construction Project Success, Project Management Journal, 18, 2, pp. 69-80, (1987); Baker B.N., Murphy D.C., Fisher D., Factors affecting project success, Projeet Management Handbook, (1988); Bissonnette L., The key factors of success in the management of tourism projects, Master’s thesis., (1996); Cooper R.G., Profitable product innovation: The critical success factors, The International Handbook on Innovation., (2003); De Wit A., Measurment of project success, International Journal of Project Management, 6, 3, pp. 164-170, (1988); Fryer K., Antony J., Douglas A., Critical success factors of continuous improvement in the public sector: A literature review and sorne key findings, The TQM Magazine, 19, 5, pp. 497-517, (2007); Mattesich P., Marta M.-C., Monsey B., Collaboration: What makes it work., (2001); Morrison A., Lynch P., Johns N., International tourism networks, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 16, 3, pp. 198-204, (2004); Nguyen L.D., Ogunlana S.O., Lan D.T.X., A study on project success factors in large-scale construction projects in Vietnam, Engineering,Construction and Architectural Management, pp. 404-413, (2004); Pinto J.K., Sievin D.P., Critical success factors across the life cycle project, International Journal of Project Management, 17, 4, pp. 57-70, (1986); Prefontaine L., Ricard L., Si cotte H., New models of collaboration for the delivery of public services: State of play, Research report prepared for CEFRIO, (2001); Prefontaine L., Ricard L., Sicotte H., New models of collaboration for the delivery of public services: Findings and challenges, Research report prepared for CEFRIO, (2002); Reed M.G., Power relations and community-based tourism planning, Annals of Tourism Research, 24, 3, pp. 566-591, (1997); Zwikael O., Globerson S., From critical success factors to critical success processes, International Journal of Production Research, 44, 17, pp. 3433-3449, (2006)","","","Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication","","","","","","22773878","","","","English","Int.

Opinions and the emotions that are embedded in them, play a key role in decision-making processes, with different effects depending on the negative or positive valence of the mood. When the choice depends on some important features (i.e., time, money, reliability/efficacy, etc.) and on other opinions (which come from previous experience), could be crucial to make the best decision. Inferring opinions and emotions enclosed in the written language is a complex task which cannot rely on body languages (posture, gestures, vocal inflections), rather than discovering concepts with an affective valence. The role of opinions extracted by the social content is crucial to support consumers' decision process; in addition, thanks opinions and emotions, it is possible to evidence improvements on existing decision supports and show how the opinion-mining techniques can be incorporated into these systems. This paper presents a tentative contribution that addresses this issue: it introduces a framework for extracting the emotions and the sentiments expressed in the textual data. The sentiments are expressed by a positive or negative polarity, the emotions are based on the Minsky's conception of emotions, that consists of four affective dimensions, each one with six levels of activations [1]. Sentiments and emotions are modeled as fuzzy sets; particularly, the intensity of the emotions has been tuned by fuzzy modifiers, which act on the linguistic patterns recognized in the sentences. The approach has been tested on some sets of documents categories, revealing interesting performance on the global framework processing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Conforming purchase behavior; Dynamic group influence; Group dynamics; Group marketing; Group norms","","","","","","","","Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The social influence of brand community: Evidence from European car clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, JULY, pp. 19-34, (2005); Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe T., Including others in the self: Extensions to own and Partner's group memberships, Individual Self, Relational Self, Collective Self, pp. 89-108, (2001); Bearden W.O., Etzel M.J., Reference group influence on product and brand purchase decisions, Journal of Consumer Research, 9, 2, pp. 183-194, (1982); Bolton L.E., Reed A., Sticky priors: The perseverance of identity effects on judgment, Journal of Marketing Research, 41, NOVEMBER, pp. 397-410, (2004); Brehm S.S., Brehm J.W., Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control, (2013); Brewer M.B., The social self: On being the same and different at the same time, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 17, OCTOBER, pp. 475-482, (1991); Brewer M.B., The psychology of prejudice: Ingroup love and outgroup hate?, Journal of Social Issues, 55, 3, pp. 429-444, (1999); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications, (2005); Cendrowski S., Nike's New Marketing Mojo, (2012); Cialdini R.B., Goldstein N.J., Social influence: Compliance and conformity, Annual Review of Psychology, 55, 1, pp. 591-621, (2004); Cialdini R.B., Trost M.R., Social influence: Social norms, conformity and compliance, The Handbook of Social Psychology, 2, pp. 151-192, (1998); Marketing Spend Facts and Stats 2014, (2015); Cova B., Kozinets R.V., Shankar A., Consumer Tribes, (2012); Crano W.D., Milestones in the psychological analysis of social influence, Group Dynamics, 4, 4, pp. 68-80, (2000); Cruz M.G., Henningsen D.D., Williams M.L.M., The presence of norms in the absence of groups?, Human Communication Research, 26, 1, pp. 104-124, (2000); Deutsch M., Gerard H.B., A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgment, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 51, 3, pp. 629-636, (1955); Dholakia U.M., Bagozzi R.P., Pearo L.K., A social influence model of consumer participation in network-and small-group-based virtual communities, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 21, 3, pp. 241-263, (2004); Escalas J.E., Bettman J.R., Self-construal, reference groups, and brand meaning, Journal of Consumer Research, 32, 3, pp. 378-389, (2005); Fehr E., Fischbacher U., Social norms and human cooperation, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8, APRIL, pp. 185-190, (2004); Festinger L., Schachter S., Back K., Social Pressures in Informal Groups: A Study of Human Factors in Housing, (1974); Fiske A.P., The four elementary forms of sociality: Framework for a unified theory of social relations, Psychological Review, 99, 4, pp. 689-723, (1992); Goldstein N.J., Cialdini R.B., Griskevicius V., A room with a viewpoint: Using social norms to motivate environmental conservation in hotels, Journal of Consumer Research, 35, 3, pp. 472-482, (2008); Grier S.A., Deshpande R., Social dimensions of consumer distinctiveness: The influence of social status on group identity and advertising persuasion, Journal of Marketing Research, 38, MAY, pp. 216-224, (2001); Guynn J., Facebook Groups Reaches 1 Billion Users, (2016); Hogg M.A., Turner J.C., Intergroup behaviour, self-stereotyping and the salience of social categories, British Journal of Social Psychology, 26, 4, pp. 325-340, (1987); Iyengar R., Van Den Bulte C., Valente T.W., Opinion leadership and social contagion in new product diffusion, Marketing Science, 30, MARCH-APRIL, pp. 195-212, (2011); Kaplan M.F., Miller C.E., Group decision making and normative versus informational influence: Effects of type of issue and assigned decision rule, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, 2, pp. 306-313, (1987); Komito L., The net as a foraging society: Flexible communities, Information Society, 14, 2, pp. 97-106, (1998); Kozinets R.V., E-tribalized marketing?

This information is valuable as it enables the identification of the area/part of the picture that attracts people's attention, which can be used as a consideration when making decisions in the future, for example in marketing. For this reason, in this study, a Neural Network (NN) model was developed to predict the fixation points of a picture. Specifically, the authors experimented with various transfer and training functions in the NN in order to determine which causes the fewest errors.

An experiment involving 308 college students who face actual purchase decisions shows that predictions of attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual behavior can be improved through the use of the augmented model for both hedonic and utilitarian products.

One of the possible applications of DEA-DA is in the marketing research area. This paper uses cluster analysis to cluster customers into two clusters: Gold and Lead. Then, to predict cluster membership of new customers, DEA-DA is applied. In DEA-DA, an arbitrary parameter imposing a small gap between two clusters (η) is incorporated. It is shown that different η leads to different prediction accuracy levels since an unsuitable value for η leads to an incorrect classification of DMUs. We show that even the data set with no overlap between two clusters can be misclassified. This paper proposes a new DEA-DA model to tackle this issue. The aim of this paper is to illustrate some computational difficulties in previous DEA-DA approaches and then to propose a new DEA-DA model to overcome the difficulties. A case study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.","cluster analysis; data envelopment analysis; data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA); discriminant analysis","Cluster analysis; Data envelopment analysis; Discriminant analysis; Forecasting; Sales; Cluster memberships; Data set; Decision making unit; Marketing research; Prediction accuracy; Small gaps; Decision making","","","","","Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (14-31593S); European Social Fund, ESF, (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/ 20.0296)","Acknowledgements—The authors wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers for valuable suggestions and comments.

However, in the last decade olive oil sector is supporting very low commercial margins and it has important problems of profitability. In a context where retail distribution plays an essential role in final price fixing and, therefore, in the total shared amount by all sector agents, the effectiveness of buy-and-sale strategies along the chain influences the commercial results of the different agents. In particular, the main income of olive oil producers comes from oil marketing in the market of origin, which integrates the maximum percentage of dealings (80%). The commercial operations in this market are the references for price negotiations in other levels of the agri-food chain, for example, with distributors. In this scene, Andalusia has a predominant role because it concentrates the Spanish production of olive oils (72,40%). So, the trading operations in this area determine, in part, the national price level and they have a high influence in worldwide prices. Due to its position as a supplier row material, the market of origin is playing a key role in the incomes of all the agents in the chain. For this reason, the study of price formation, its dynamic and the variables that can influence in this process, is needed in order to know the price evolution and therefore, to decide the best moment to buy and sell. In this sense, from our point of view, in the literature is possible to underline two main characteristics that could influence in price's evolution. (1) The prices of different quality levels are very similar Price's differences are small and this fact contrasts with the public strategy to improve the quality of Spanish olive oil production (quality programmes from national and regional government and the European Union). And (2), in the last decade, these differences between qualities are constant and with a similar evolution. So, it could be possible to predict price's evolution only with the price of a quality and adding some cents in order to know the price of the rest. Based on the social context and the development of databases in the market of origin in Andalusia, the objective of this paper is to analyse the casual relationship between the prices of three qualities that are sold in origin: extra virgin, virgin and lampante. The methodology used to study the price evolution and its relationships is based on the cointegration theory, the Error Correction Model and it is completed with the study of short-run relationships through Granger's causality, variance decomposition of forecast errors and impulse response functions. Analysis includes 106 monthly data of each price series for the most instability period in the market of origin (since January'01 to October'09). This information was provided by the Foundation for the Promotion and Development of the Olive Grove and Oil, based on the POOLred System of origin prices. This system collects the features of bulk olive oil transactions of a sample of Andalusian olive oil mills that represents 55.30% of Spanish olive oil production. It is currently the main price reference in this sector. Results show that, in long term, origin is a strong integrated market and it is in equilibrium because the prices of three qualities move together during all the period. However, in short term it is possible to highlight the virgin olive oil as a leader in the market. It is the quality more independent and with more influence over the rest. So, price movements of virgin quality could predict the evolution of the other price's qualities. These outcomes are coherent with the role of virgin quality in the market of origin. Virgin olive oil is the quality with more number of commercial operations in the market. This volume is a consequence of its versatility, because can be used as direct consumption product, to mix with other olive oils or to refine. On the one hand, the direct consumption of virgin quality, similar to the virgin extra olive oil could be an influence in the price of the last one, adopting a role of direct competitor. In this sense, the use of extra virgin as a bait product for distributors reduces the differences between both prices and increase the competency. Furthermore, the consumer's confusion between different qualities of olive oils favours this situation. On the other hand, because a part of virgin's production is used to refne in order to produce olive oil, its prices could be a reference for the price of lampante. At the same time, the strategy of quality implemented by public administration is increasing the volume of virgin and extra virgin olive oils produced in Andalusia and, therefore, the numbers of commercial operations with these qualities in the market of origin. So, when quality production exceeds consumption, a part of these olive oils is destined to elaborate low quality olive oil and it increases price competition. In sum, the large number of operations and its versatility transform the virgin olive oil into the quality more important in the market of origin, from the point of view of price influences. This conclusion is useful to develop managerial strategies, specifically in the forecasting of price behaviour in the market. Because the prediction of price evolution in origin market is affected by several subjective aspects (crop level or weather prevision, for example), the use of an objective predict variable, as a virgin olive oil price, could improve the results of the models. Particularly, these results affect to the study of prices in order to request to government the intervention of the market through private storage system (Spanish Ministry of Agricultural and European Union). Furthermore, in general these results are useful for the development of agri-food policies by sector institutions, which analyse the prices in the market of origin in order to make decision about funding and grant. Finally, this paper could be a starting point to analyse causal relationship between different olive oils in the two main market of the agri-food chain (origin and final market), with the objective to know what variables have to be included in price's forecast models.","Causality; ECM; Olive oils; Price; Quality","","","","","","","","Breusch T.S., Testing for autocorrelation in dynamic linear models, Australian Economic Paper, 17, 31, pp. 334-355, (1978); Calatrava J., Gonzalez-Roa M.C., El consumo y la demanda de aceites de oliva en España: Informe de resultados del proyecto CAO98-017, DESA.

The incentive-compatible decision on credit term is made endogenously and in coordination to ensure Pareto optimality for both the supplier and the retailer. Our model factors in financing, marketing, operations, default risk, and risk attitude coherently, treating trade credit as their intersectional nexus. We introduce the uncertainty due to the possible default of the retailer on the accounts payable into our model. The in-kind nature of trade credit is in line with the two-stage lottery method employed in this paper to capture the consequences of default on trade credit effectively. We find that financing capacity encourages the supplier to extend the credit term: a larger market demand rate prompts the supplier to extend a longer credit term, but a higher holding cost for the retailer shortens the length of the credit term received. More risk-averse suppliers tend to grant shorter term, but the impact of risk attitude is insignificant. Empirically, we find evidence supporting our main theoretical predictions by employing a panel sample of manufacturing companies covering 1998–2007 from the COMPUSTAT database. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bilevel programming; Default risk; Economic ordering quantity (EOQ); Trade credit; Two-stage lottery","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (70825003, 71172014)","Acknowledgments We acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Grant Numbers: 71172014 and 70825003).","Aggarwal S.P., Jaggi C.K., Ordering policies of deteriorating items under permissible delay in payments, J Oper Res Soc, 46, pp. 658-662, (1995); Allen F., Qian J., Qian M., Law, finance, and economic growth in China, J Financ Econ, 77, (2005); Altman E.I., Financial ratios, discriminant analysis and the prediction of corporate bankruptcy, J Financ, 23, pp. 589-609, (1968); Arellano M., Bover O., Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-components models, J Econometr, 68, (1995); Benishay H., Parameters and relations of stochastically lagged and disaggregative time series, Econometrica, 36, pp. 155-171, (1968); Bias B., Gollier C., Credit and credit rationing, Rev Finan Stud, 10, pp. 903-937, (1997); Burkart M., Ellingsen T., In-kind finance:a theory of trade credit, Am Econ Rev, 94, pp. 569-590, (2004); Chapman C.B., Cooper D.F., Page M.J., Ward S.C., Credit policy and inventory control, J Oper Res Soc, 35, pp. 1055-1065, (1984); Ferris J.S., A transactions theory of trade credit use, Quart J Econ, 94, pp. 243-270, (1981); Goyal S.K., Economic Order quantity under conditions of permissible delay in payments, J Oper Res Soc, 36, pp. 335-338, (1985); Haley C.W., Higgins R.C., Inventory policy and trade credit financing, Manag Sci, 20, pp. 464-471, (1973); Jaber M.Y., Osman I.H., Coordinating a two-level supply chain with delay in payments and profit sharing, Comput Ind Eng, 50, pp. 385-400, (2006); Kouvelis P., Zhao W., Financing the newsvendor: supplier vs. bank, and the structure of optimal trade credit contracts, Oper Res, 60, pp. 566-580, (2012); Lee Y., Stove J., Production risk, asymmetric information, and trade credit, J Financ Quant Anal, 28, pp. 285-300, (1993); Long M., Malitz I., Ravid A., Trade credit, quality guarantees and production marketability, Financ Manag, 22, pp. 117-127, (1993); Mateut S., Bougheas S., Mizen P., Trade credit, bank lending and monetary policy transmission, Eur Econ Rev, 50, pp. 603-629, (2006); Meltzer A.H., Mercantile credit, monetary policy, and size of firms, Rev Econ Stat, 42, pp. 429-437, (1960); Munson C.L., Rosenblatt M.J., Coordinating a three-level supply chain with quantity discounts, IIE Trans, 33, pp. 371-384, (2001); Nadiri M., The determinants of trade credit in the US total manufacturing sector, Econometrica, 37, pp. 408-423, (1969); Peterson M.A., Rajan R.G., Trade credit: theories and evidence, Rev Financ Stud, 10, pp. 661-691, (1997); Pratt J.W., Risk aversion in the small and in the large, Econometrica, 32, pp. 122-136, (1964); Schwartz R.A., An economic model of trade credit, J Financ Quant Anal, 9, pp. 643-657, (1974); Segal U., The Ellsberg paradox and risk aversion: an anticipated utility approach, Int Econ Rev, 28, pp. 175-202, (1987); Segal U., Two-stage lotteries without the reduction axiom, Econometrica, 58, pp. 349-377, (1990); Smith J.K., Trade credit and informational asymmetry, J Financ, 42, pp. 863-872, (1987)","X.

This paper considers the act of responding positively to a phenomenon by sharing it with others, something exemplified by the online social media acts of choosing to 'like' on Facebook, 'retweet' on Twitter, or by a similar mechanism on websites such as LinkedIn, Flickr or Pinterest. Using a threshold model of influence, simulations are run on four network structures where a critical mass chooses to share a phenomenon that eventually either goes viral or does not. The data collected are examined to determine whether an individual node can make an accurate prediction about the state of the entire network just from information on the behavior of their neighbors. The intention is to study what it is in terms of network structure that makes an individual good at sensing the zeitgeist, or 'spirit of the age'. Findings show that those best placed to predict are 'important' as measured by network centrality, and members of numerous communities. The characteristics of the critical mass are important in determining the spread of a phenomenon and it is possible for an individual node to predict an outcome as well as an observer who has access to the state of every node in the network. Potential applications might be found in monitoring the success of marketing campaigns, or in organizations wishing to keep abreast of current trends in a situation where data on network structure is available but data on the activity of network members is limited. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Consensus decision; Simulation; Social network; Viral marketing","Commerce; Forecasting; Marketing; Social networking (online); Accurate prediction; Consensus decision; Marketing campaign; Network centralities; Network structures; Online social medias; Simulation; Viral marketing; Computer simulation","","","","","","","Abrahams A.S., Jiao J., Fan W., Wang G.A., Zhang Z., What's buzzing in the blizzard of buzz automotive component isolation in social media postings, Decision Support Systems, 54, 4, pp. 871-882, (2013); Abrahams A.S., Jiao J., Wang G.A., Fan W., Vehicle defect discovery from social media, Decision Support Systems, 54, 1, pp. 87-97, (2012); Aral S., Walker D., Creating social contagion through viral product design: A randomized trial of peer influence in networks, Management Science, 57, 9, pp. 1623-1639, (2011); Aral S., Walker D., Identifying influential and susceptible members of social networks, Science, 337, 6092, pp. 337-341, (2012); Bainbridge W.S., The Warcraft Civilization, (2010); Bakshy E., Karrer B., Adamic L.A., Social influence and the diffusion of user-created content, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce.

Real-world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the ""right"" model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a ""generic"" model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward ""automating"" the crucial task of choice model selection. © 2013 INFORMS.","Choice models; Marketing mix; Nonparametric choice; Preference list; Revenue prediction; Utility preference","Commerce; Marketing; Risk perception; Choice model; Marketing mix; Non-parametric; Preference lists; Utility preference; Forecasting","","","","","","","Anderson S.P., De Palma A., Thisse J.F., Discrete Choice Theory of Product Differentiation, (1992); Belobaba P.P., Hopperstad C., Boeing/MIT Simulation Study: PODS Results Update 1999 AGIFORS Reservations and Yield Management Study Group Sympos, (1999); Ben-Akiva M.E., Lerman S.R., Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand, (1985); Berry S., Levinsohn J., Pakes A., Automobile prices in market equilibrium, Econometrica, 63, 4, pp. 841-890, (1995); Bierlaire M., BIOGEME: A free package for the estimation of discrete choice models, Proc. 3rd Swiss Transportation Res.

This is true despite the problems caused by some academic journal articles’ use and abuse of theory development. The argument for this crucial role of theory in marketing practice explains reasons why many practitioners dislike academic research and related theory development, as well as points out where practitioners’ criticisms are valid. Design/methodology/approach – Delineation of problems in journal articles and some research notes the overall value of work for marketing practice and (indirectly) points out the important value of practitioner-focused research publications. Findings – While marketing practitioners are wrong to condemn all theory development as useless, too often in too many ways, researchers and journals deserve it. Yet, despite the problems, marketing practice needs marketing theory. Originality/value – This paper points out an ongoing common myopia of marketing practice, whereby practitioners miss out on the value of theory development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Marketing education; Practitioner decision making; Pragmatic prediction; Theory","","","","","","","","Armstrong J.S., Unintelligible management research and academic prestige, Interfaces, 10, 2, pp. 80-86, (1980); Broyles S.J., Subliminal advertising and the perpetual popularity of playing to people's paranoia, Journal of Consumer Affair, 40, 2, pp. 392-406, (2006); Fitzsimons G.J., Death to dichotomizing, Journal of Consumer Research, 35, 1, pp. 5-8, (2008); France K.R., Bone P.F., Policy makers' paradigms and evidence from consumer interpretation of dietary supplement labels, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 39, pp. 27-51, (2005); Gossage H.L., Rotzoll K., Graham J., Mussey B., Is There Any Hope for Advertising, (1987); Gould S.J., The Mismeasure of Man, (1981); Gould S.J., The Flamingo's Smile: Reflections in Natural History, (1985); Hofstede G., The cultural relativity of the quality of life concept, Academy of Management Review, 9, 3, pp. 389-398, (1984); Mandal B., Use of food labels as a weight loss behavior, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 44, 3, pp. 516-527, (2010); Maslow A.H., A theory of human motivation, Psychological Review, 50, 4, pp. 370-396, (1943); Maslow A.H., Motivation and Personality, (1954); Moore T., Subliminal advertising: What you see is what you get, Journal of Marketing, 46, 2, pp. 38-47, (1982); Moore T., The case against subliminal manipulation, Psychology and Marketing, 5, pp. 297-316, (1988); Ogilvy D., Confessions of an Advertising Man, (1963); Rotfeld H.J., Fear appeals and persuasion: Assumptions and errors in advertising research, Current Issues and Research in Advertising, 11, 1, pp. 21-40, (1988); Rotfeld H.J., Marketing wisdom of Dagwood, Hagar or Charlie Brown, AMS Quarterly, 2, (1998); Rotfeld H.J., The textbook effect: Conventional wisdom, myth, and error in marketing, Journal of Marketing, 64, 2, pp. 122-126, (2000); Rotfeld H.J., Convenient abusive research, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 37, 1, pp. 191-194, (2003); Rotfeld H.J., Mistaking precision for reality, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 41, 1, pp. 187-191, (2007); Rotfeld H.J., Stafford M.R., Toward a pragmatic understanding of the advertising and public policy literature, Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising, 29, 1, pp. 67-80, (2007); Rotfeld H.J., The stealth influence of covert marketing and much ado about what may be nothing, Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, 27, 1, pp. 63-68, (2008); Rotfeld H.J., Editors talking, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 44, pp. 615-619, (2010); Sabbane L.I., Lowrey T.M., Chebat J.C., The effectiveness of cigarette warning label threats on non-smoking adolescents, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 43, 2, pp. 332-345, (2009); Schiffman L., Kanuk L., Consumer Behavior, (2009); Smith K.H., Stutts M.A., The influence of individual factors on the effectiveness of message content in antismoking advertisements aimed at adolescents, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 40, 2, pp. 261-293, (2006); Tangari A.H., Burton S., Howlett E., Cho Y.N., Thyroff A., Weighing in on fast food consumption: The effects of meal and calorie disclosures on consumer fast food evaluation, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 44, 3, pp. 431-462, (2010); Wolburg J.M., College students' responses to antismoking messages: Denial, defiance and other boomerang effects, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 40, 2, pp. 294-323, (2006)","H.J.

Neuromarketers assert that people's bodies are, for marketing purposes, more truthful than the words they utter, promising direct access to formerly concealed aspects of consumer desire. This article situates the promise to bypass the vagaries of discourse with techniques for reading the body within the broader context of a changing information environment and the forms of reflexive awareness of the partial and constructed character of narrative forms of representation. It explores the uptake by neuromarketers of recent theories that posit emotional responses as integral to the process of rational decision making. This uptake repositions marketers as adjuncts to rational deliberation rather than threats to it and the forms of autonomy and citizenship with which it is associated. However, the article argues that neuromarketers’ claims to bypass mediation and the impasses of representation break down upon further examination. In the end, an examination of the recent literature on the topic indicates that neuromarketers – like data miners – are more interested in potentially useful correlations than in underlying explanations. Their portrayal of neuromarketing as a technique for accessing what consumers’ ‘really’ feel amounts to a misreading of their own project, which might be more properly understood as the development of techniques for making probabilistic predictions about the behaviour of populations. © 2012, Edinburgh University Press.

The purpose of this monitoring is to provide an advantage in terms of on-farm management decision making, crop marketing planning, and support for policy decision-making. We identified here which VI's can be used to predict soybean grain yield (GY) by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and remote multispectral sensor. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in three sites during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons in Brazil. The VI's were measured together with the plant stand assessment at 25 days after emergency (DAE) when the plants were at V4 phenological stage. The processing of the VI models was performed based on the imaging reflectance factor data performed in the field. For statistical data analyses, a correlation network was used to express the relationship between GY and VI's graphically. Path analysis was performed for identifying the cause-and-effect relationship between VI's and GY. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm was generated considering GY as a dependent variable. At last, the relative deviation coefficient was used to illustrate the differences between the VI's in the construction of the decision tree and GY. Our results showed potential for predicting soybean yield based on UAV and the multispectral sensor coupled. SAVI and NDVI indices stood out for predicting yield, where the regions with the highest values of these indices can obtain the highest yield observed in the field, providing an advantage in management at the property level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree; Glycine max; Path analysis; Precision agriculture; Spatial variability","","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","The authors would like to thank the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul and CAPES.

The world has been making remarkable efforts to make everything green and cleaner by the help of the advanced technology, including transportation. The technology especially the E marketing, social media, etc. focuses on orienting people to believe that hybrid and electrical vehicles generate less pollution, will save money and reduce dependence on natural sources of fuel. This research aims to inspect the relationship between Stimuli Factors, Electrical Vehicles' (Ev) and Hybrid Vehicles' (Hv) Consumers and Response Purchase Decisions (S-O-R), in addition to inspect the moderation effects of Psychological Inputs on S-O-R relationship in Vehicle industry of Jordan. The current research used quantitative method to gather accessible data from the sample of the study. Variables used in this study include HVs & EVs consumers, Stimuli factors (marketing inputs, external environment) and positive psychological inputs and response purchase decisions. Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach as a statistical method was used to analyze the data. Results indicate that all the relations had a positive significant, except the interactional relationship between Stimuli factors which includes marketing inputs, external environment, and positive psychological inputs, affect response purchase decisions. In other words, the mediation (HVs & EVs consumers) shows valuable change for the prediction of response purchase decisions while, moderated effect of psychological inputs did not make change. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Drawing on research with British police, we contextualize these algorithmic processes within actual police practices, focusing on protest policing. Although aspects of algorithmic decision-making have become prominent in police practice, our research shows that they are embedded within a continuous human–computer negotiation that incorporates a rooted claim to ‘professional judgement’, an integrated intelligence context and a significant level of discretion. This context, we argue, transforms conceptions of threats. We focus particularly on three challenges: the inclusion of pre-existing biases and agendas, the prominence of marketing-driven software, and the interpretation of unpredictability. Such a contextualized analysis of data uses provides important insights for the shifting terrain of possibilities for dissent. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Big data; dissent; predictive policing; protest; social media","","","","","","Media Democracy Fund; Open Society Foundations Sometimes referred; Ford Foundation; Open Society Foundations","Funding text 1: This article is based on the project ‘Managing “Threats”: Uses of Social Media for Policing Domestic Extremism and Disorder in the UK’ funded by the Media Democracy Fund, the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations Sometimes referred to as ‘big social data’ (cf.

In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a fuzzy inference system (FIS) are designed for marketing mix model. By using the P4 principle (price, product, place, promotion) and by combining it with the marketing experts' knowledge, good results were achieved using ANFIS. This system as an advisor with high accuracy can reduce the human errors and play a significant role in decision making by corporate managers.

Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, United States","The purchasing process consists of multiple, non-isolated phases that describe the interactions between consumers and products. One of these phases is the evaluation of alternatives, in which the consumer compares the benefits that will be obtained from each product or service depending on a set of criteria. Recently, the rise of online ecosystems has fueled the development of new purchasing-decision prediction models (PDPM) based on the shared opinions, concerns, and expectations of customers. Commonly, these PDPMs are constructed as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, where experts ascertain the consumer's purchasing criteria, as well as the importance of them, by means of surveys and their own experience. Although relying on experts may be appropriate for identifying criteria, this approach is not suitable for assessing the importance of said criteria due to the large volume of information available on the Web. Furthermore, the preferences of consumers in online ecosystems evolve constantly. In this regard, we consider that the information about purchase-criteria importance should be derived exclusively from the opinions of consumers. However, the attitude and thought-process leading to purchases contain inherent relationships that consumers are not able to express explicitly; consequently, we explore the possibility to make use of the synergies between criteria along user preferences. This paper proposes a new PDPM that estimates the importance of the criteria and values the alternatives by only considering the opinions expressed by consumers in digital ecosystems, while using an expert-defined set of criteria. The proposed approach extracts the weights of both criteria and alternatives and determines the implicit synergies within them without the need of additional input. Lastly, it uses the Choquet integral for weight and valuation aggregation and determines a purchase ranking. This model has been tested in real examples, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2018","Aggregation operators; Choquet integral; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Synergy criteria","Decision theory; Ecosystems; Integral equations; Learning to rank; Marketing; Mathematical operators; Operations research; Predictive analytics; Purchasing; Sentiment analysis; Aggregation operator; Choquet integral; Digital ecosystem; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Prediction model; Purchase criteria; Purchasing decisions; Synergy criteria; Sales","","","","","","","Hocevar K.P., Flanagin A.J., Metzger M.J., Social media self-efficacy and information evaluation online, Comput.

The present study examines how ethics influences a person's decision to adopt cloud computing, and how in turn ethical behaviours affect technology innovations. Based on social cognitive theory, this paper proposes that a higher ethical and entrepreneurial orientation will lead to a person adopting cloud computing. Moreover, the marketing, learning and outcome expectancy a person has about cloud computing will positively affect their intention to adopt this technology. The predictions are tested through a survey, which indicates that ethics and marketing are important determinants of a person's behavioural intention towards technology innovations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.","Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity","Aircraft manufacture; Consumer behavior; Purchasing; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Online product reviews; Product returns; Product reviews; Product uncertainties; Purchase decision; Regression discontinuity; Return probabilities; Theoretical modeling; Sales","","","","","","","Anderson E.T., Hansen K., Simester D., The option value of returns: Theory and empirical evidence, Marketing Sci, 28, 3, pp. 405-423, (2009); Anderson M., Magruder J., Learning from the crowd: Regression discontinuity estimates of the effects of an online review database, Econom.

Data mining methods provides the insurance industry with numerous advantages: shorter data processing times, more sophisticated methods for more accurate data analysis, better decision-making, etc. Insurance companies use data mining methods for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to fraud prevention. The process of insurance premium pricing was one of the first applications of data mining methods in insurance industry. The application of the data mining method in this paper aims to improve the results in the process of non-life insurance premium ratemaking. The improvement is reflected in the choice of predictors or risk factors that have an impact on insurance premium rates. The following data mining methods for the selection of prediction variables were investigated: Forward Stepwise, Decision trees and Neural networks. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used for premium ratemaking, as the main statistical model for non-life insurance premium pricing today in most developed insurance markets in the world. © 2020, University of Rijeka.

This special issue presents 10 papers that provide overviews of important aspects of the recent adoption literature, or identify gaps and opportunities in the literature. Adoption research has been innovative in a number of ways, including its recognition of adoption decision making as a process, not an event; its emphases on heterogeneity and learning; and its strong multidisciplinary flavor. There is scope for further innovation through efforts to enhance predictions of adoption, better understanding the balance between profit and non-profit motivations, and better recognizing the influence on adoption of characteristics of the innovations, not just characteristics of the potential adopters and their contexts. Opportunities for policy include effort to support women farmers' adoption of beneficial innovations in developing countries, and use of tools and approaches from marketing in public extension programs. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association","adoption of innovations; agricultural extension; agricultural policy; behavior change; technology change","","","","","","","","Chavas J.-P., Nauges C., Uncertainty, Learning and Technology Adoption in Agriculture, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 42-53, (2020); Heiman A., Ferguson J., Zilberman D., Marketing and Technology Adoption and Diffusion, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 21-30, (2020); Huffman W.E., Human Capital and Adoption of Innovations: Policy Implications, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 92-99, (2020); Llewellyn R., Brown B., Predicting Adoption of Innovations by Farmers: How Is it Different in Smallholder Agriculture?, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 100-112, (2020); Montes de Oca Munguia O., Llewellyn R., The Adopters Versus the Technology: Which Matters More When Predicting or Explaining Adoption?, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 80-91, (2020); Norton G.W., Alwang J., Changes in Agricultural Extension and Implications for Farmer Adoption of New Practices, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 8-20, (2020); Pannell D.J., Claassen R., The Roles of Adoption and Behavior Change in Agricultural Policy, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 31-41, (2020); Rogers E.M., Diffusion of Innovations, (2003); Rola-Rubzen F., Paris T.R., Hawkins J., Sapkota B., Improving Gender Participation in Agricultural Technology Adoption in Asia: From Rhetoric to Practical Action, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 113-125, (2020); Streletskaya N.A., Bell S.D., Kecinski M., Li T., Banerjee S., Palm-Forster L.H., Pannell D.J., Agriculture Adoption and Behavioral Economics: Bridging the Gap, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 54-66, (2020); Suri T., Selection and Comparative Advantage in Technology Adoption, Econometrica, 79, 1, pp. 159-209, (2011); Weersink A., Fulton M., Limits to Profit Maximization as a Guide to Behavior Change, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, 42, 1, pp. 67-79, (2020)","D.

Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%–6% in transactions’ prices. Our results lend ample support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic behavior. © 2016 INFORMS.","Airline industry; Decision support; Information availability; Revenue management; Strategic consumers","","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J., Curley S., Zhang J., Recommender systems, consumer preferences, and anchoring effects, Recsys, 2011, pp. 35-42, (2011); Alderighi M., Gaggero A.A., Piga C.A., The effect of code-share agreements on the temporal profile of airline fares, Transportation Res.

This was done for a database, obtained from a large Korean mobile telephone service provider, of 533 customer calls to call centers in 2009. After eliminating calls not containing customer complaints or comments, the remaining 383 comments were classified by an expert panel into four domains and 27 complaint categories. The four domains were Transaction-related (189 comments, 49%), Product-related (120 comments, 31%), Customer Service or Support-related (38 comments, 10%) and Customer Outreach and Marketing-related (36 comments, 9%). The comments were then randomly assigned to either a training set (257 cases, 67%) or test set (126 cases, 33%). The training set was used to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier that correctly predicted the domain 75% of the time and the specific subcategory 51% of the time for the test set. Prediction accuracy was strongly related to prediction strength for both sets of predictions, suggesting that simple filtering strategies where difficult to understand comments are flagged for expert review and easy comments are automatically classified are both technically feasible and likely to be practically valuable. Several strong predictors were also identified that corresponded to categories more detailed than those originally assigned. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.","Bayesian inference; Call center agent; Customer complaints; Decision support; TextMiner","Bayesian networks; Classifiers; Decision support systems; Inference engines; Sales; Bayesian inference; Call centers; Customer complaints; Decision supports; TextMiner; Taxonomies","","","","","","","Baumeister R.F., Bratslavsky E., Finkenauer C., Vohs K.D., Bad Is Stronger Than Good, Review of General Psychology, 5, 4, pp. 323-370, (2001); Bitner M.J., Booms B.H., Tetreault M.S., The service encounter: Diagnosing favorable and unfavorable incidents, Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 71-84, (1990); Bosch V.G., Enriquez F.T., TQM and QFD: Exploiting a customer complaint management system, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 22, 1 SPEC.

The main aim of the paper is the assessment of Lattakia market price dynamics and to verify the use of regression and OLS models as tools of an Agricultural Marketing Information System (AMIS) for citrus price forecasting in the Lattakia region. To this end, five indicators were applied to the data set and two models for citrus wholesale price prediction on the Lattakia markets were tested in the paper. These indicators and models were applied to empirical data, obtained from an actual Marketing Information System in the Lattakia Region. The results showed high volatility in the prices between the markets and over different months and the regression model with an index of determination R² = 0.90 was identified as suitable for seasonal price predictions (short term forecasting), while the least square method was a good tool for annual price prediction (long term). © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

We collect and combine several unique datasets to study the impact of air pollution on consumers’ choices of passenger vehicles in China. Exploiting cross-city variation, we find that air pollution levels negatively affect the sales of fuel-inefficient cars on average. This relationship, though, is U-shaped over the observed air pollution levels, in that fuel-inefficient car purchases rise with air pollution beyond some threshold. Furthermore, a city’s income level is a significant factor in this non-monotonic relationship, in the sense that consumers of higher-income cities are less likely to suffer this reversal. All these results are consistent with the literature’s theoretical predictions of hope. The rich findings of our study yield important implications to both marketers and policy makers. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Applied industrial organization; Choice model; Consumer behavior; Environmental economics; Green marketing; Hope","","","","","","","","Berry S.T., Estimating discrete-choice models of product differentiation, RAND Journal of Economics, 25, 2, pp. 242-262, (1994); Berry S.T., Waldfogel J., Free entry and social inefficiency in radio broadcasting, RAND Journal of Economics, 30, 3, pp. 397-420, (1999); Bonini S., Hintz G., Addressing consumer concerns about climate change, (2008); Chen Y., Jin G.Z., Kumar N., Shi G., The promise of Beijing: evaluating the impact of the 2008 Olympic Games on air quality, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 66, 3, pp. 424-443, (2013); Einav L., Seasonality in the U.S. motion picture industry, RAND Journal of Economics, 38, 1, pp. 127-145, (2007); Goldstein N.J., Cialdini R.B., Griskevicius V., A room with a viewpoint: using social norms to motivate environmental conservation in hotels, Journal of Consumer Research, 35, 3, pp. 472-482, (2008); Hardin G., The tragedy of the commons, Science, 162, 3859, pp. 1243-1248, (1968); Kotler P., Reinventing marketing to manage the environmental imperative, Journal of Marketing, 75, 4, pp. 132-135, (2011); Lloyd W.F., Two lectures on the checks to population, Available on Google Books, (1833); MacInnis D.J., de Mello G., The concept of hope and its relevance to product evaluation and choice, Journal of Marketing, 69, 1, pp. 1-14, (2005); Mazar N., Zhong C.B., Do green products make us better people?, Psychological Science, 21, 4, pp. 494-498, (2010)","J.

The current study contributes to this topic by providing empirically based prescriptive advice to drive better measurement model specification. Specifically, the decision-making procedures developed by this study can complement theoretical reasons for a model choice as well as help determine a correct model choice when theories are equivocal or non-existent. This study combines actual and simulated data to show that model fit statistics alone cannot determine which model specification is correct, but also that a correct measurement model will generate more accurate predictions within a model which in turn will offer more accurate managerial recommendations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","formative measures;

Yet, B to B organizations remain cautious in their social media pursuits, in part based on a stated lack of understanding for best practices. The purpose of the current work is to take initial steps to address this challenge by identifying specific social media message features that influence online users’ engagement with B to B organizations. Methodology/Approach: This work examines the Twitter feeds of the top 50 social B to B brands (as reported by Brandwatch in 2015) to examine the effects of message features (hashtags, text difficulty, embedded media, and message timing) on user engagement, captured in terms of Twitter likes and retweets. Findings: We argue that message features that enhance fluency (e.g., images) should enhance engagement. In contrast, those that disrupt fluency (e.g., hasthags) should result in lower levels of engagement. Consistent with these predictions, we find that hashtags and text difficulty correlate to lower levels of engagement whereas embedded media in the form of images and video correlate to higher levels of engagement. Also consistent with the proposed fluency framework, we find that tweets from B to B organizations generate greater engagement on evenings and weekends. Research Implications: This research applies a fluency lens to identify specific message features that influence online engagement. In doing so, it highlights fluency as a powerful construct for understanding the drivers of B to B social media brand engagement. More generally, this work suggests fluency as a valuable conceptual lens for developing effective B to B social media strategies. This research also speaks to the complexity of B to B social media strategies–organizations must go beyond content and platform decisions, to also consider the specific features of the message. Practical Implications: Social media is becoming more and more important to B to B organizations and is as yet an underutilized engagement tool. The current work offers initial strategies regarding message features that business practitioners can incorporate into their content development strategies to strengthen engagement. Specifically, efforts should be made to attain high levels of fluency in B to B social media content development. Originality/Value/Contribution of the Paper: The current work offers initial insights as to the importance of understanding not only how social media topics/content influence engagement, but also the influence of message features (e.g., hashtags, embedded media). In doing so, it highlights fluency as a novel conceptual lens for developing more effective B to B social media strategies.

More than $300 billion in U.S. sales are affected annually by RPM agreements. Adopting a marketing perspective and analyzing trends in distribution arrangements and marketing channel systems, the authors offer predictions regarding the antitrust treatment of RPM following the Supreme Court’s decision in Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc. (2007). This research furthers the understanding of the role of the prior Colgate doctrine in establishing the existence of an RPM agreement and the impact of the new Leegin factors for assessing the competitive effects of RPM.

The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers' self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers' private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathie managers' self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions, the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity endorsement. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Consumer preference predictions;

While the adversarial arrival models are too pessimistic, many of the stochastic (such as i.i.d. or random-order) arrival models do not realistically capture uncertainty in predictions. A significant cause for such uncertainty is the presence of unpredictable traffic spikes, often due to breaking news or similar events. To address this issue, a simultaneous approximation framework has been proposed to develop algorithms that work well both in the adversarial and stochastic models; however, this framework does not enable algorithms that make good use of partially accurate forecasts when making online decisions. In this article, we propose a robust online stochastic model that captures the nature of traffic spikes in online advertising. In our model, in addition to the stochastic input for which we have good forecasting, an unknown number of impressions arrive that are adversarially chosen. We design algorithms that combine a stochastic algorithm with an online algorithm that adaptively reacts to inaccurate predictions. We provide provable bounds for our new algorithms in this framework. We accompany our positive results with a set of hardness results showing that our algorithms are not far from optimal in this framework. As a byproduct of our results, we also present improved online algorithms for a slight variant of the simultaneous approximation framework. Copyright © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

The literature has introduced the individual-level and the segment-based predictive modeling approaches for this purpose. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and performs in certain cases. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach which predicts customers’ individual purchase behaviors and reduces the limitations of these two methods by combining the advantages of them. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hybrid approach is established based on individual-level and segment-based approaches and utilizes the historical transactional data and predictive algorithms to generate predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in the domain of supermarket shopping by using real-world data and using five popular machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests. Findings: A comparison of results shows that the proposed hybrid approach substantially outperforms the individual-level and the segment-based approaches in terms of prediction coverage while maintaining roughly comparable prediction accuracy to the individual-level method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that logistic regression performs better than the other classifiers in predicting customer purchase behavior. Practical implications: The study concludes that the proposed approach would be beneficial for enterprises in terms of designing customized services and one-to-one marketing strategies. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to adopt a hybrid approach combining individual-level and segment-based approaches to predict customers’ individual purchase behaviors. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer behavior models;

Using technology-enabled online community data, this study examines whether ‘pre-launch’ brand favourability can predict community's post-launch purchase decisions, by introducing a new construct called community-based brand equity (CoBBE). This study also investigates whether CoBBE can predict future sales of new products. Weekly data are collected for eight weeks before and after product launch from a movie-based online community for a period of 16 months. The results show that community-based variables such as pre-launch brand awareness level, brand favourability and brand strength have a significant influence on 1) community members' post-release purchase decisions both in the opening week as well as the entire lifetime of products, and 2) satisfaction level. The study also finds that CoBBE is a significant predictor of future market sales, thus showing the usefulness of CoBBE as an early warning diagnostic tool which will enable movie studios to gain early brand-related insights as well as to make early corrective actions when needed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Brand awareness; Brand equity; Brand favourability; Online community; Sales prediction","Forecasting; Marketing; Online systems; Social networking (online); Brand awareness; Brand equity; Brand favourability; Community-based; Corrective actions; Diagnostic tools; On-line communities; Purchase decision; equity; prediction; technology adoption; World Wide Web; Sales","","","","","","","Anderson R.E., Consumer dissatisfaction: the effect of disconfirmed expectancy on perceived product performance, J.

Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Environment; Ethical products; Green marketing; Self-accountability; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Aronson E., Fried C.B., Stone J., Overcoming denial and increasing the intention to use condoms through the induction of hypocrisy, American Journal of Public Health, 81, 12, pp. 1636-1638, (1991); Auger P., Devinney T., Do what consumers say matter?

To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109-126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate. This study's results indicate that the inclusion of social effects increases the predictive power of the customer churn model (Nitzan and Libai, Journal of Marketing 75(6):24-38, 2011), thus contributing to our understanding of the role social networks play in customer decisions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Co-experience network;

Organizations that formerly concentrated on transactional sales thus confront a new challenge associated with managing service usage—retention and extracting value from investments in smart technology. This study combines a marketing and an information systems perspective in a field study conducted jointly with a large European car manufacturer. Understanding the renewal decision for IT-based service contracts requires knowledge from both disciplines. The paper shows that combining behavioral predictor variables stemming from marketing research and technology-related perceptual variables stemming from technology acceptance research increases the explanatory power and prediction accuracy of forecasting models for customer renewal decisions. Specifically, the authors show that perceptions of usefulness become more important the longer customers use IT-based services and the more services they use within the service contract. © 2017","Contract renewal; Customer churn; Free trial; IT-based service; Retention; Smart services","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., Nature and operation of attitudes, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 27-58, (2001); Albarracin D., Wallace H.M., Glasman L.R., Survival and change of attitudes and other social judgments: A model of judgment activation and comparison, Advances in experimental social psychology, 36, pp. 251-315, (2004); Babin B.J., Darden W.R., Griffin M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 4, pp. 644-656, (1994); Baron S., Patterson A., Harris K., Beyond technology acceptance: Understanding consumer practice, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 17, 2, pp. 111-135, (2006); Bart I., Venkatesh S., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

The main purpose of this paper was to compare three different quantitative forecasting methods and develop a monthly short term sales forecasting model specifically on shoes of A-Shoe Company, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Twelve months (December 2013 - November 2014) sales data (of different types of pair of shoes) was collected from the company. From quantitative forecasting methods, a time-series model, that is, moving average, weighted moving average, and exponential smoothing were used to predict monthly sales forecast for the month of December 2014. Trend equation was formulated by using the least square regression method; analysis was done along with standard error of estimate. Prediction interval limits at 95% level of confidence were calculated. Exponential smoothing forecasting method (with alpha value 0.1) was found to be fit when comparing different mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE). The forecasted shoe sales value was found to be within the prediction interval limits. ANOVA results revealed that the calculated value of F (9.34) was less than the table value of F (10.04). Hence, the null hypothesis (b = 0) is accepted. The resulting forecasting method can be used to provide a framework to forecast sales, specifically for national and international products and can position an organization's manufacturing services by designing the manufacturing service.","ANOVA; Confidence level; Quantitative forecasting methods; Sales forecasting; Shoe demand marketing","","","","","","","","Armstrong J.S., Research on forecasting: A quarter-century review 1960-1984, Interface, 5, 1, pp. 89-103, (1986); Bails D.G., Peppers L.C., Business fluctuations, (1993); Baker K.R., Kroop D.H., Management science: An introduction to the use of decision models, (1998); Bolt G., Sales forecasting, (1994); Bunn D., Wright G., Interaction of judgmental and statistical forecasting methods: Issues and analysis, Management Science, 37, 5, pp. 501-518, (1991); Clifton P., Nguyen H., Nutt S., Clifton P., Market research: Using forecasting in business, (1998); Cox J.E., Loomis D.G., Diffusion offorecastingprinciples through books, principles offorecasting, (2001); Evans J.R., Statistics, data analysis, and decision modeling, (2000); Karjagi R., Chakrabarty C., Mohite R., Multivariate model for forecasting the wheat prices in India, Indian Journal of Marketing, 40, 2, pp. 14-16, (2010); Kirsten R., Business cycles: Market structure and market interaction, (2000); Levin R.P., Rubin D.S., Stinson J.P., Quantitative approaches to management, (1986); Mahmoud E., Accaiacy of forecasting:Asurvey, Journal of Forecasting, 3, 2, pp. 139-151, (1954); Nahmias S., Production and operations analysis, (2005); Peterson H.C., Lewis W.C., Managerial economics, (1999); Sanders N.R., The status of forecasting in manufacturing firms, Production and Inventory Management Journal, 38, 1, pp. 32-36, (1997); Shahabuddin S., Forecasting automobile sales, Management Research News, 3, 7, pp. 670-682, (2009); Sharma A., Borah S.B., Forecasting the ensuing impact of 3G on business practices in India: An exploratory Analysis, Indian Journal of Marketing, 41, 9, pp. 31-37, (2011); Waddell D., Sohal A.S., Forecasting: The key to managerial decision making, Management Decision, 32, 1, pp. 41-49, (1994)","","","Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

However, there is little agreement on what factors are dominating individual information disseminating behavior on SNS, and what’s worse, more and more factors are added into the prediction model, without examining the relevance of them and even why these factors are added is rarely discussed. This leads to undesirable outcomes such as increasing the cost of measuring and computing irrelevant/redundant features. Most importantly, it hinders us from understanding what discriminative features are affecting individual information disseminating behavior. Using a unique real-life Twitter data set consisting of 55,575 twitterers and 9,440,321 tweets, the authors examine what discriminative features are dominating individual information disseminating behavior. The results indicate that topic distance is the most discriminative factor, highlighting that self-presentation motives play an important role in information disseminating decisions. Besides, the amount of information, social relationship and the popularity of the tweet also contribute to individual information disseminating decisions. Experiments demonstrate that adopting only dominating factors can improve prediction performance in terms of various indicators, compared with adopting the full features set. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing theoretical and practical implications of our findings. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017.","Data mining; Dominating features; Individual retweeting decisions; Information disseminating behaviour; Online marketing; Social networking sites","","","","","","","","Allsop D.T., Bassett B.R., Hoskins J.A., Word-of-mouth research: Principles and applications, J Adv Res, 47, 4, pp. 398-411, (2007); Bakshy E., Hofman J.M., Mason W.A., Watts D.J., Everyone’s an Influencer: Quantifying Influence on Twitter, pp. 65-74, (2011); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, J Mark Res, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Cheung C., Thadani D.R., The impact of electronic word-of-mouth communication: A literature analysis and integrative model, Decis Support Syst, 54, 1, pp. 461-470, (2012); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Q, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Deerwester S.C., Dumais S.T., Landauer T.K., Furnas G.W., Harshman R.A., Indexing by latent semantic analysis, J am Soc Inf Sci, 41, 6, pp. 391-407, (1990); Deutsch M., Gerard H.B., A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgment, J Abnorm Soc Psychol, 51, 3, (1955); Evans J.D., Straightforward Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, (1996); Feng W., Wang J., Retweet Or Not?

Distributors require the demand forecasts to make decisions such as marketing strategy and costs, number of screens, and release timing. Movie demand is known to show seasonality. Thus, forecasting methods which are able to capture such patterns can be relied on to produce an accurate prediction. In this paper, we study the performance of the recently proposed exponential smoothing method. It is known as total and split exponential smoothing, and applies it to box office from the United States on monthly basis. The forecasts are evaluated against other seasonal exponential smoothing methods. Overall, total and split exponential smoothing with subjectively chosen parameters was performing well, followed by seasonal damped trend exponential smoothing method (DA-M). © 2018, Universita Putra Malaysia.","Exponential smoothing;

Design/methodology/approach – A new hybrid methodology is presented based on clustering techniques and mining top-k and distinguishing sequential rules. This methodology is implemented on the data of 14,772 subscribers of a mobile phone operator in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The main data include the call detail records and event detail records data that was acquired from the IT department of this operator. Findings – Seven different behavioral groups of customer shifts were identified. These groups and the corresponding top-k rules represent the dominant patterns of customer behavior. The results also explain the relation of customer switching behavior and segment instability, which is an open problem. Practical implications – The findings can be helpful to improve marketing strategies and decision making and for prediction purposes. The obtained rules are relatively easy to interpret and use; this can strengthen the practicality of results. Originality/value – A new hybrid methodology is proposed that systematically extracts the dominant patterns of customer shifts. This paper also offers a new definition and framework for discovering distinguishing sequential rules. Comparing with Markov chain models, this study captures the customer switching behavior in different levels of value through interpretable sequential rules. This is the first study that uses sequential and distinguishing rules in this domain. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business analysis; Customer segmentation; Data analysis","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Srikant R., Mining sequential patterns, pp. 3-14, (1995);

Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones. In addition, this paper allows us to find out which hybrid technique performs best in terms of CLV prediction. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer information; Customer lifetime value;

This is due to the fact that consumers have become more affluent and aware of their health. Edible bird's nest (EBN) is used as a health supplement for medicinal benefits to improve health quality. However, issues such as contamination and counterfeit EBN have caused fluctuation of the product's price over time and consumers are slowly shunning away from consuming EBN products. Marketing effort is a strategy tool often used to convince buying intention among consumers and therefore relieve the public's anxiety. Presently, the extent of marketing mix that can convince consumers' intention to purchase EBN products remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the influence of marketing mix towards consumers' intention to purchase EBN products. Principle component analysis and decision tree models were used to analyze the data. The performance of three decision tree models was compared based on accuracy and sensitivity rate. Result showed that all three models possessed similar accuracy rate (CART = 84.35%, C5.0 = 84.73%, QUEST = 83.08%), while C5.0 had the highest sensitivity (CART = 84.7%, C5.0 = 87.46%, QUEST = 85.59%). The important variables derived from C5.0 model are health conscious, gender, promotion, race, price, employment, and income. The outcomes from the present study through the performance prediction have provided informative profile of the consumers which will be useful to target potential consumers and to narrow down the market segment for the marketers' benefit. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Classification; Decision tree; Edible bird's nest; Marketing mix; Purchase intention","","","","","","","","Abdullah A.A., Ibrahim I., Tengku-Chik T.I., Ghazali Z., An empirical study on the identification of success factors in swiftlet ranching business in Malaysia, Proceedings of the International Conference and Training on Swiftlet Ranching Taman Tamadun Islam Convention Centre, (2011); Akhter S., Rizwan M., Shujaat S., Durrani Z., The impact of retail shoes sales promotional activities on ladies' purchase intentions, Journal of Public Administration and Governance, 4, 2, pp. 166-178, (2014); Aswir A.R., Wan Nazaimoon W.M., Effect of edible bird's nest on cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) release in vitro, International Food Research Journal, 18, 3, (2011); Breiman L., Friedman J., Stone C.J., Olshen R.A., Classification and regression trees, CRC press, (1984); Cheng L., Borneo Post Online.

A systematic literature method has been conducted to explore the current practices as well as aspects that can help farmer at field level for increasing production. This study reveals several technologies and practices in agriculture that are based on big data for taking right decision at right time in right way at the field level. The study reveals that use of agricultural big data technologies are still a low level and needs more investment for infrastructure establishment, related expertise, technological knowledge of farmers, attitude of adoption of technologies and awareness about the benefits of big data technologies. It also explores that application of big data technologies can help farmer to weather forecasting, crop selection, irrigation management, crop diseases and pest management, crop yield prediction, agricultural marketing, and agricultural policy decision. But farmer needs help from an expert team to implement the facilities at field level. The study argues that a commercial implementation of big data technologies requires government initiatives, private sector’s involvement and a public-private partnership to supply related facilities to farmers in time. © 2020, IJSTR.","Agricultural development; Digital agriculture; Digital farm; Precision agriculture; Smart agriculture; Smart farming; Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","Sagar B.M., N.

However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample. For managers and researchers alike, our criteria offer a verifiable explanation for differences in marketing elasticities and an actionable connection between marketing and financial performance metrics. © 2014 INFORMS.","Consumer attitude metrics; Cross-effects model; Dynamic programming model; Empirical generalizations; Hierarchical linear model; Optimal marketing resource allocation; Potential; Responsiveness; Sales conversion; Stickiness","","","","","","","","Ailawadi K.L., Lehmann D.R., Neslin S.A., Revenue premium as an outcome measure of brand equity, J.

We find that the change caused overall retail prices to decrease. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the response across brands. In the cell phone category, brands with high market shares and inelastic demand did not change prices. In the watch category, the retail prices of relatively low-end brands decreased while the prices of premium brands increased substantially after the switch. In addition to sales increases due to lower prices, we find that the channel structure change further caused sales to increase by 9–10% in the cell phone category and by 11–17% in the watch category. These results are consistent with previous theoretical predictions. We believe that our results provide important academic and managerial implications due to the increasing prevalence of manufacturer-managed systems in the retail industry. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society","channel management; decision delegation; empirical study; marketing; retailing","","","","","","","","Abhishek V., Jerath K., Zhang Z.J., Agency selling or reselling?

Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method with several other classifiers used in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the ROC curve and geometric mean. © 2016","Ensemble;

Time-series data on the number of customers on both sides of the markets allow platform intermediaries for estimating the direction and magnitude of network effects, which can then support growth predictions and subsequent information technology (IT) or marketing investment decisions. This article investigates the conditions under which this estimation of same-side and cross-side network effects should distinguish between its impact on the number of new customers (i.e., acquisition) and existing customers (i.e., their activity). The authors propose an influx-outflow model for doing so and conduct a simulation study to benchmark the new model against the traditional model. Further they compare the models in an illustrative empirical study in which they study the growth of an Internet auction platform. The results show that this separation of effects is beneficial because the existing customers on both sides of the market can influence the acquisition and dropout of other customers asymmetrically. The paper thus makes an important contribution that should impact the way how researchers and business practitioners measure network effects in two-sided markets. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","customer acquisition; customer churn; electronic commerce; online intermediaries; platform economy; Two-sided markets","Electronic commerce; Sales; Customer acquisition; Customer churns; online intermediaries; platform economy; Two-sided markets; Investments","","","","","Data Science Institute at Goethe University Frankfurt; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","This work has been [co-]funded by the DFG as part of the CRC 1053 MAKI and by the efl–the Data Science Institute at Goethe University Frankfurt.

In its pursuit for scientific legitimacy and credibility to academics and practitioners alike, research into B2B relationships as a subject of scientific enquiry will need to seriously engage into what can be termed a true paradigm shift, one that advances discovery in this area from sheer descriptive analysis and reporting to the development of explanatory schemata and theoretical frameworks of a kind that allow for more accurate prediction of underlying B2B phenomena. In doing so, theoreticians and practitioners alike will be better equipped to understand both current and emerging issues at hand as well as their implications to organizations across any geography, cultural context, or business situation. Should this be attained with some degree of success, it will mean a reduction in ambiguity accruing to the decision making of individuals in organizations, and thus a significant contribution to the overriding objective of corporate strategic planning and correspondent resource allocation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Aaboen L., Dubois A., Lind F., Strategizing as networking for new ventures, Industrial Marketing Management, 42, pp. 1033-1041, (2013); Aarikka-Stenroos L., Ingemansson M., Launberg A., Controlling the commercialisation of science across inter-organisational borders: Four cases from two major Swedish universities, Industrial Marketing Management, 43, pp. 382-391, (2013); Aarikka-Stenroos L., Sandberg B., Lehtimaki T., Networks for the commercialization of innovations: A review of how divergent network actors contribute, Industrial Marketing Management, 43, pp. 365-381, (2014); Achrol R.S., Changes in the theory of interorganizational relations in marketing paradigm, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 25, pp. 56-71, (1997); Alderson W., Scope and place of wholesaling in the United States, Journal of Marketing, 14, pp. 145-155, (1949); Alderson W., Cox R., Towards a theory of marketing, Journal of Marketing, 13, pp. 137-152, (1948); Anderson J., Narus J., A model of distributor firm and manufacturer firm working partnership, Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 42-58, (1994); Appel J.H., Golden book of the Wanamaker stores, 1, (1911); Avlonitis G., Panagopoulos N., Selling and sales management: An introduction to the special section and recommendations on advancing the sales research agenda, Industrial Marketing Management, 39, pp. 1045-1048, (2010); Backhaus K., Steiner M., Lugger K., To invest, or not to invest, in brands?

Business analysts and decision makers highlighted that including new customers seems to be costly than that of maintaining prevailing customers. Customer relationship management (CRM) and Business analysts have to recognize the cause of churn customers and to validate behavioural patterns from prevailing churn customer‘s data. This work anticipated a churn prediction model that utilizes clustering and classification approaches to recognize churn customers and to give factors that resides behind customer churning in telecom sectors. Feature selection is carried out with association attribute ranking model and weighted oversampling technique. The proposed approach initially classifies churn customers data with Adaptive Logitboost (ALB) classification algorithm for classifying the instance more appropriately. Generation of retention policies is a significant process of relationship management to eliminate churners. After performing classification approach, these model segments customers‘ data by categorization using requirement similarity matrix to acquire information gain. This model validates churn factors that are needed for determining primary cause of churn. By recognizing essential churn factors from customer data, CRM may enhance productivity by recommending appropriate promotions to set of customers based on association among behavioural patterns. Thereby, marketing campaigns are improved for the company. The anticipated churn prediction model is computed with metrics like precision, accuracy, F-measure, recall and receiving operating characteristics (ROC) area. Results depict that anticipated churn prediction provides better classification with ALB and customer profiling with requirement similarity matrix. Moreover, it provides cause of customer churning through generation of related pattern association. © 2020 IJSTR.","Association rule; Behavioural pattern; Churn customer; Prediction model; Similarity matrix","","","","","","","","Runge P.G., Garcin F., Faltings B., Churn prediction for highvalue players in casual social games, Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG), 2014 IEEE Conference On.

Our study addresses this gap and uses the adaptive decision maker as well as the fast and frugal heuristics frameworks to gain a better understanding of managerial decision making. Using the process-tracing tool MouselabWEB, we presented sales managers in retail banking with three typical customer management prediction tasks. The results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a significant increase in accuracy. Hence, the existing skepticism concerning heuristics should be questioned. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.","Adaptive decision making; Customer management; Fast and frugal heuristics; Mouselab; Process-tracing","","","","","","","","Alter A.L., Oppenheimer D.M., Uniting the tribes of fluency to form a metacognitive nation, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 13, 3, pp. 219-235, (2009); Anderson P.A., Decision making by objection and the Cuban missile crisis, Administrative Science Quarterly, 28, 2, pp. 201-222, (1983); Ballinger G.A., Using generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data analysis, Organizational Research Methods, 7, 2, pp. 127-150, (2004); Bazerman M.H., Judgment in Managerial Decision Making, (1998); Berger P.D., Nasr N.I., Customer lifetime value: marketing models and applications, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 12, 1, pp. 17-30, (1998); Berger P.D., Nasr Bechwati N.I., The allocation of promotion budget to maximize customer equity, Omega, 29, 1, pp. 49-61, (2001); Bettman J.R., Johnson E.J., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Correlation, conflict, and choice, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 19, 4, pp. 931-951, (1993); Bettman J.R., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Constructive consumer choice processes, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 3, pp. 187-217, (1998); Biggs S.F., Bedard J.C., Gaber B.G., Linsmeier T.J., The effects of task size and similarity on the decision behavior of bank loan officers, Management Science, 31, 8, pp. 970-987, (1985); Blattberg R.C., Deighton J., Manage marketing by the customer equity test, Harvard Business Review, 74, 4, pp. 136-144, (1996); Blattberg R.C., Getz G., Thomas J.S., Customer Equity: Building and Managing Relationships as Valuable Assets, (2001); Bolton R.N., A dynamic model of the duration of the customer's relationship with a continuous service provider: the role of satisfaction, Marketing Science, 17, 1, pp. 45-65, (1998); Breiman L., Friedman J., Olshen R.A., Stone C.J., Classification and Regression Trees, (1993); Broder A., Assessing the empirical validity of the 'take-the-best' heuristic as a model of human probabilistic inference, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 26, 5, pp. 1332-1346, (2000); Broder A., Decision making with the 'adaptive Toolbox': influence of environmental structure, intelligence, and working memory load, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 29, 4, pp. 611-625, (2003); Broder A., Schiffer S., Take the best versus simultaneous feature matching: probabilistic inferences from memory and effects of representation format, Journal of Experimental Psychology.

The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Duration framing;

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the influence of demographic and psychological constructs on students’ preferences when choosing to study in a particular faculty through the application and testing of a student choice logit model based on data collected from a survey of existing students. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regression techniques were used to estimate the probability of undergraduate prospective students’ choices with reference to a set of variables that allows for the prediction and classification of students (n=304) at an Australian university. Using the estimated coefficients of both student characteristics and psychological variables, probability outputs were constructed to compute the faculty membership for student groups. Outputs were also illustrated via a set of simulation analyses. Findings: The results of the student choice logit model are highly significant suggesting demographic, socioeconomic and psychological variables play a role in the prediction of faculty membership of undergraduate students. Practical implications: These findings have implications for researchers, educational policy makers and career planners. The study also suggests that these policies should take into account the complexities of multi-attribute influences on students’ decision-making choices. Originality/value: This research offers an innovative marketing use of logistics regression techniques with application of the student choice logit model through predicting the likelihood of faculty membership in an education context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Higher education; Logit model; Membership","","","","","","","","Bennett R., Students’ motives for enrolling on business degrees in a post-1992 university, International Journal of Educational Management, 18, 1, pp. 25-36, (2004); Blackburn G., Which Master of Business Administration (MBA)?

People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for “word of mouth” advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms. © 2018","Link prediction; Matrix completion; Multi-relational social networks; Potential relations; Similarity","Behavioral research; Commerce; Constrained optimization; Forecasting; Insurance; Investments; Marketing; Planning; Belief propagation; Business transformations; Human resources development; Large-size networks; Link prediction; Matrix completion; Potential relations; Similarity; Decision making","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61379064, 61379066, 61402395, 61472344, 61602202, 61702441); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (09KJB20013, 12KJB520019, 13KJB520026, BK2012128, BK2012672, BK20130452, BK20140492); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province, (2011-DZXX-032)","This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant Nos. 61379066 , 61702441 , 61379064 , 61472344 , 61402395 and 61602202 ; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under contracts BK20130452 , BK2012672 , BK2012128 , BK20140492 and Natural Science Foundation of Education Department of Jiangsu Province under contract 12KJB520019 , 13KJB520026 , 09KJB20013 .

Here, we address the question of when and why simple models succeed - or fail - by framing the forecasting problem in terms of the bias-variance dilemma. Controllable error in forecasting consists of two components, the ""bias"" and the ""variance"". We argue that the benefits of simplicity are often overlooked because of a pervasive ""bias bias"": the importance of the bias component of prediction error is inflated, and the variance component of prediction error, which reflects an oversensitivity of a model to different samples from the same population, is neglected. Using the study of cognitive heuristics, we discuss how to reduce variance by ignoring weights, attributes, and dependencies between attributes, and thus make better decisions. Bias and variance, we argue, offer a more insightful perspective on the benefits of simplicity than Occam''s razor. © 2015 .","Bias bias; Bias-variance dilemma; Occam's razor; Out-of-sample prediction;

Analyzing and measuring WoM is quite valuable in product design, sales prediction, marketing strategy, and other decision-making tasks. In contrast to previous studies that analyze product WoM focusing on a single product, we propose an influence framework to measure WoM from a market perspective. In this framework, we combine product competition relationships and customer intercommunication relationships to construct a two-layer network and calculate the node influence effects in the network. To compare different product WoM measures, we use product sales as a predictor and build a series of predictive models. In the experiments conducted based on Amazon.com data, we find that, first, textual sentiment analysis produces a better summary of customer opinions than rating scores. Second, product-comparative relationships provide additional information on measuring product WoM. Third, the customer intercommunication feature in social media is useful for measuring the collective opinions about a product. The influence framework and experimental findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Product network; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth","Commerce; Data mining; Decision making; Marketing; Network layers; Sales; Product networks; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth; Product design","","","","","","","Yang C., Et al., Understanding online consumer review opinion with sentiment analysis using machine learning, Pac.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 306 graduate students were surveyed on the environmental considerations in their purchase behavior using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Findings: The results of the study indicate that, in general, attitude and SI are more important than SN in influencing green purchase intention in a collectivistic country, such as Ghana. Yet, most respondents were neutral in their responses to questions as to whether they are green consumers and/or if they consider themselves to be concerned about environmental issues. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to study environmental consideration in purchase decisions in Ghana, a resource-rich, emerging and one of the strongest economies in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environment;

The WOE approach allows analysts to identify and transform the variables with the most predictive power regarding the likelihood of tourists' online preferences and decisions. The study found that just over one-third of the respondents browsed hotel-related websites, and about half of those browsers had booked a room on those sites. Browsers in Hong Kong tended to be young, well educated, and well traveled. Those who used the hotel websites for purchases were, of course, part of the browser group, and were likewise relatively well educated. However, one unexpected variable set off those who used the websites for a hotel purchase, the length of their most recent trip. One possible reason is that long-haul tourists want to be sure of their accommodations, or this may reflect hotels' free-night offers. The convenient use of model-based customer segmentation and decision rules would help hospitality practitioners effectively manage their marketing resources and activities, and enhance information-based marketing strategies to attract target customers. © The Author(s) 2013.","data mining; hotel website; information technology; prediction; travel behavior; weight of evidence","","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (10YJCZH174); Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to acknowledge the funding supports from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Sun Yat-sen University, and the Social Science Youth Fund of Ministry of Education (Grant 10YJCZH174).","Amemiya T., Advanced Econometrics, (1985); Domestic households by monthly domestic household income, (2006); Population and vital events, (2008); Cybenko G., Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function, Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, 2, 4, pp. 303-314, (1989); Good I.J., Probability and Weighting of Evidence, (1950); Good I.J., Osteyee D.B., Information, Weight of Evidence: The Singularity between Probability Measures and Signal Detection, (1974); Gronflaten O., Predicting travelers' choice of information sources and information channels, Journal of Travel Research, 48, 2, pp. 230-244, (2009); Distribution of educational attainment of population aged 15 and over, (2008); Kim J., Wei S., Ruys H., Segmenting the market of West Australian senior tourists using an artificial neural network, Tourism Management, 24, 1, pp. 25-34, (2003); Kim W.G., Kim D.J., Factors affecting online hotel reservation intention between online and non-online customers, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 23, 4, pp. 381-395, (2004); Law R., Hsu C., Importance of hotel website dimensions and attributes: Perceptions of online browsers and online purchasers, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 30, 3, pp. 295-312, (2006); Massey F.J., The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for goodness of fit, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 46, 253, pp. 68-78, (1951); McCall M., Voorhees C., The drivers of loyalty program success: An organizing framework and research agenda, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 51, 1, pp. 35-52, (2010); Morosan C., Jeong M., Users' perceptions of two types of hotel reservation web sites, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 27, 2, pp. 284-292, (2008); Murphy J., Bennett M., Hofacker C.F., Website-generated market-research data: Tracing and tracks left behind by visitors, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 82-91, (2001); O'Connor P., E-mail marketing by international hotel chains: An industry-practices update, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 49, 1, pp. 42-52, (2008); O'Connor P., Frew A.J., The future of hotel electronic distribution: Expert and industry perspectives, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 43, 3, pp. 33-45, (2002); O'Connor P., Piccoli G., Global distribution systems: Revisited, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 44, 5-6, pp. 105-114, (2003); Olsen M.D., Connolly D.J., Experience-based travel: How technology is changing the hospitality industry, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 41, 1, pp. 30-40, (2000); Toh R.S., DeKay F., Raven P., Travel planning: Searching for and booking hotels on the internet, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 52, 4, pp. 388-398, (2011); Toh R.S., Raven P., DeKay F., Selling rooms: Hotels vs. third-party websites, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 52, 2, pp. 181-189, (2011); Verma R., Customer choice modeling in hospitality services: A review of past research and discussion of some new applications, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 51, 4, pp. 470-478, (2010); Vina L., Ford J., Logistic regression analysis of cruise vacation market potential: Demographic and trip attribute perception factors, Journal of Travel Research, 39, pp. 406-410, (2001); Weed D.L., Weight of evidence: A review of concept and methods, Risk Analysis, 25, 6, pp. 1545-1557, (2005); Wen I., Factors affecting the online travel buying decision: A review, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 21, 6, pp. 752-765, (2009); Wong J., Law R., Analysing the intention to purchase on hotel websites: A study of travellers to Hong Kong, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 24, 3, pp. 311-329, (2005)","E.

It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

The authors study how sellers should optimize their marketing decisions in response. They find that a seller can benefit from ""demarketing"" its product, meaning visibly toning down its marketing efforts. Demarketing lowers expected sales ex ante but improves product quality image ex post, as consumers attribute good sales to superior quality and lackluster sales to insufficient marketing. The authors derive conditions under which demarketing can be a recommendable business strategy.

The scoring model is based upon attributes available froma database. Our Bayesian predictive decision theoretic solution is based on two features: (1) a three-parameter bounded, asymmetric loss function BLINEX that has a higher penalty for failure to choose good prospects rather than including too many bad prospects; and (2) a Bayesian nonstandard t-predictive distribution for a future optimal score derived from normal-gamma likelihood function with unknown mean and variance based on data consisting of past optimal activation scores together with a four-parameter conjugate prior. The parameters of the BLINEX loss are also derived from past data. A comparison of BLINEX derived profits with those fromtraditional squared error loss is made via a fractional factorial experimental design with a half-normal analysis. It shows that our method is far superior based on predicted profit and that, of all parameters, the BLINEX asymmetry and prior mean are the most influential main effects. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Bayesian decision theory; Bayesian prediction; BLINEX loss; Predictive inference; Scoring models","Chemical activation; Commerce; Decision theory; Forecasting; Profitability; Asymmetric loss function; Bayesian decision theory; Bayesian predictions; Fractional factorial experimental design; Likelihood functions; Predictive distributions; Predictive inferences; Scoring models; Marketing","","","","","","","Aitchison J., Dunsmore I.R., Statistical Prediction Analysis, (1982); Berger J.O., Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, (1985); Chakilam V.B., Levy M.S., Bayesian Decisive Prediction Approach to Optimalmailing Size Using BLINEX Loss, (2011); Coetsee J., Bekkera A., Millarda S., Preliminary test and Bayes estimation of a location parameter under BLINEX loss, Communications in Statistics: Theory and Methods, 43, 17, pp. 3641-3664, (2014); Direct Marketing Response Rate Reports, (2015); Islam F.M., Petit L.I., Bayesian sample size determination for the bounded linex loss function, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 84, 8, pp. 1644-1653, (2014); Kleyn J., Arashi M., Bekkera A., Millard S., Preliminary testing of the Cobb-Douglas production function and related inferential issues, Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, (2015); Milliken G.A., Johnson D.E., Analysis of Messy Data, 2, (2008); Murphy K.P., Conjugate Bayesian Analysis of the Gaussian Distribution, (2007); Wen D., Levy M.S., BLINEX: A bounded asymmetric loss function with application to Bayesian estimation, Communications in Statistics: Theory and Methods, 30, 1, pp. 147-153, (2001); Wen D., Levy M.S., Admissibility of Bayes estimates under BLINEX loss for the normal mean problem, Communications in Statistics: Theory and Methods, 30, 1, pp. 155-163, (2001); Wen D., Levy M.S., Algorithms for fitting BLINEX loss parameters, Communications in Statistics, Part B-Simulation and Computation, 33, 3, pp. 597-608, (2004); Wen D., Li Y., Levy M.S., An application of Bayes estimation under bounded asymmetric BLINEX loss: Direct mail decision problem, American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 29, 3-4, (2009); Varian H.R., A Bayesian approach to real estate assessment, Studies in Bayesian Econometrics and Statistics in Honor of Leonard J.

Jindal Global University, Soinpat, India","Purpose: Given the high uncertainty in the quality perception of experiential products, manufacturers use signals to influence consumers’ decisions. In the movie industry, literature shows that performance of the main channel (e.g. cinema) strongly influences the performance of auxiliary channels (e.g. DVDs). The success of a movie in the home country is also to be resonated by its good performance in host countries. However, the cultural contingency of these success-breeds-success (SBS) effects has not been examined. This paper aims to test the influence of cultural values on the SBS effects across channels and countries. Design/methodology/approach: Borrowing concepts from the signaling literature and analyzing DVD sales data from six international markets using a multilevel mixed-effects model, the study finds that culture plays a significant role to influence both SBS effects. Findings: In countries with low power distance, short-term orientation and high indulgence, consumers who purchase from auxiliary channels are more likely to be influenced by the box office performance of movies. Meanwhile, cultural distance between the home and host nations significantly decreases the cross-national SBS effect. Research limitations/implications: The findings are likely to be generalized to online auxiliary channels of movies, but empirical testing is required to ensure that no major adaptation is required in the process. Future research can also extend the framework of this paper to include more countries into the analysis and investigate cultural variables beyond Hofstede’s dimensions. Practical implications: This paper suggests that the SBS effects may vary across nations. When managers plan for the sequential distributions of experiential products, the cultural values of target markets should be considered to decrease the uncertainty in sales prediction. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the international auxiliary channels of movies and incorporating cultural values into the framework of sequential distributions. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to test the links between the main and auxiliary channels from an international marketing perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Auxiliary channels; Cultural values; Hierarchical mixed-effect models; International marketing; Movies","","","","","","","","Ahmed S., Sinha A., When it pays to wait: optimizing release timing decisions for secondary channels in the film industry, Journal of Marketing, 80, 4, pp. 20-38, (2016); Akdeniz M.B., Talay M.B., Cultural variations in the use of marketing signals: a multilevel analysis of the motion picture industry, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 41, pp. 1-24, (2013); Basuroy S., Desai K.K., Talukdar D., An empirical investigation of signaling in the motion picture industry, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 2, pp. 287-295, (2006); Bernerth J.B., Aguinis H., A critical review and best-practice recommendations for control variable usage, Personnel Psychology, 69, 1, pp. 229-283, (2016); Bohnenkamp B., Knapp A.-K., Hennig-Thurau T., Schauerte R., When does it make sense to do it again?

Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Naïve Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer limited predictive power and that confounding factors are critical to adoption probability predictions. © 2013 INFORMS.","Adoption probability; Bayesian learning; Confounding factor; Entity similarity; Social influence; Social network; Structural equivalence","Forecasting; Marketing; Maximum principle; Probability; Social networking (online); Bayesian learning; Confounding factor; Entity similarities; Social influence; Structural equivalence; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Altshuler Y., Pan W., Pentland A., Trends prediction using social diffusion models, Internat.

Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The decision to buy was also influenced by the brand type (national brand or private label). Data from 21 participants were recorded during exposure to 20 fast-moving consumer goods. The electroencephalographic signal from the frontal lobe (F3 and F4) served to calculate the frontal asymmetry index for alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Electromyographic electrodes were placed on the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles, whereas the galvanic skin responses were gathered from the forefinger and ring finger of the nondominant hand. Eye tracking glasses were used to control for eye movements. After product exposure, participants filled in the Purchase Intentions Scale, which then served to assess the final binary decision. A logistic regression model was applied to determine which neurophysiological factors play a crucial role in predicting a purchase decision and whether the brand type is relevant. The prediction rate of the resulting model was 65.8%.

The theory includes the outcomes of selections of specific decision alternatives. Building behavioral-strategy models in contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. This chapter is a primer to the general theory. A brief review of relevant empirical studies supports the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytically tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, statistical hypothesis testing, ethnographic decision tree modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., qualitative comparative analysis, QCA). The general theory is the blending of cognitive science, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices in explicit contexts. Consequently, behavioral-strategy theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only decision-making. Capturing and reporting contextually driven alternative routines to strategy setting by a compelling set of propositions represents what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory. The general theory serves as a useful foundation for advances theory and improving the practice of implemented strategies.

More specifically, cost behavior, cost estimation, cost prediction, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, contribution income statement and pricing/promotional strategy. Study level/applicability: This case is suitable to be used in advanced undergraduate level. Case overview: This case demonstrates the issues relating to pricing strategy of “Video Internet Marketing Training”. Diyana Tahir and her husband, Abdul Rahim Abdul Shukor, established Aras Design & Multimedia Centre (ADMC) on January 17, 2009. The main office was located at Kuala Lumpur. Diyana was a well-known name in the field of internet video marketing training. In its early years, ADMC’s operation was limited to providing printing and graphic design services and offering printing materials for photocopy. However, with the passage of time, the company began to expand its services and offerings. At the beginning of 2010, ADMC offered editing facilities and services for video and multimedia in addition to its core services. As a unique marketing strategy, Diyana offered RM30 as the basic training fee for each participant, which was equivalent to RM470 value offered. In this way, she attracted customers to take part in further advanced level training that was conducted by ADMC. However, she felt that the number of participant to take advanced training was not satisfactory. She thought that it happened perhaps due to the fact that the participants were not much committed to the course since it was offered at a nominal price. Furthermore, she realized that the cost of providing such training had risen in the past six months. Currently, ADMC suffered losses in three consecutive months, and they really needed enough cash to sustain. As such, Diyana was thinking to reconsider the offered course fees whether to increase it. She was in a rush to make a decision to propose the new course fee in the monthly meeting with management committee at the end of April 2013. Expected learning outcomes: Using this case, students can learn how a small-scale company can strategize its pricing strategy to survive in the highly competitive online market. The objectives of using this case are as follows: to help students in understanding the interrelationships between CVP in organization that can be used for future planning and decision-making; to be able to identify the cost structure of the basic training course (e.g. fixed and variable costs), determine the contribution margin, break-even point and prepare the contribution income statement that highlighting cost behavior; to help students to think critically while setting the price for the offered services; to develop students’ ability in analyzing the existing situation to come up with a viable and effective solution; to assist students in taking the right move in a right time; to broaden students’ views and understanding in considering the monetary aspect along with the human aspect in formulating an effective marketing strategy; to develop students’ understanding of the way to retain and attract customers through innovative pricing strategy; and to make students aware that innovation is the key to business success.

Evidence-based principles are currently used to improve decisions in other complex situations, such as those faced in engineering and medicine. Design/methodology/approach – Scores were calculated from the ratings of 17 self-trained novices who rated 96 matched pairs of print advertisements for adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles. Predictions from traditional methods – 10,809 unaided judgments from novices and 2,764 judgments from people with some expertise in advertising and 288 copy-testing predictions – provided benchmarks. Findings – A higher adherence-to-principles-score correctly predicted the more effective advertisement for 75 per cent of the pairs. Copy testing was correct for 59 per cent, and expert judgment was correct for 55 per cent. Guessing would provide 50 per cent accurate predictions. Combining judgmental predictions led to substantial improvements in accuracy. Research limitations/implications – Advertisements for high-involvement utilitarian products were tested on the assumption that persuasion principles would be more effective for such products. The measure of effectiveness that was available –day-after-recall – is a proxy for persuasion or behavioral measures. Practical/implications – Pretesting advertisements by assessing adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles in a structured way helps in deciding which advertisements would be best to run. That procedure also identifies how to make an advertisement more effective. Originality/value – This is the first study in marketing, and in advertising specifically, to test the predictive validity of evidence-based principles. In addition, the study provides the first test of the predictive validity of the index method for a marketing problem. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Combing forecasts; Copy testing;

Rules mean prediction. The application of these language rules to persuasive campaigns through linguistic technology can result in major gains in advertising, political and marketing outcomes. For qualitative researchers in communications, marketing and messaging, one area of persuasive language technology can be found in the linguistic feature of symmetry. Language has many forms of symmetry, and most persuaders are unaware that a great deal of persuasion depends upon symmetrical message structures. In persuasion, a mirror image or symmetrical reflection of an attitude or opinion is more persuasive than a random or non-symmetrical message or idea. Reading the subtle features of language to create symmetrical responses can create extraordinarily successful results for research and applied persuasive efforts ranging from single interviews to mass marketing campaigns. © 2012: Joseph Yeager, Linda Sommer, and Nova Southeastern University.","Decision prototyping; Linguistic research; Linguistic symmetry; Motivation and decision grammar; Persuasive communications; Predictive motivational profiling; Qualitative research","","","","","","","","Berens J., Weave Mirror [Photograph], (2007); Chomsky N., Language and Mind, (1968); Dilts R., Yeager J., Overcoming Resistance to Persuasion, (1990); Wikipedia; Hayakawa S.I., Language In Thought and Action, (1990); Odenwald S., What if string theory is wrong?, Astronomy, 35, 2, pp. 30-34, (2007); Sills G.J., Means, motive, and opportunity: Establishing culpability in pharmacoresistant epilepsy (Commentary section), Epilepsy Currents, 7, 2, pp. 51-53, (2007); Astronomy, 35, 2, pp. 8-10, (2007); Whorf B.L., Language, Thought and Reality: Selected Writings of B.

It aims at contributing to the consolidation of ABS as a field of applied research in management and organizational studies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out a non-systematic search in literature published between 2000 and 2016, by using the keyword “agent-based” to search through Scopus’ business, management and accounting database. Additional search criteria were devised using the papers’ keywords and the categories defined by the divisions and interest groups of the Academy of Management. The authors found 181 articles for this survey. Findings: The survey shows that ABS provides a robust and rigorous framework to elaborate descriptions, explanations, predictions and theories about organizations and their processes as well as develop tools that support strategic and operational decision making and problem-solving. The authors show that the areas that report the highest number of applications are operations and logistics (37 percent), marketing (17 percent) and organizational behavior (14 percent). Originality/value: The paper illustrates the increasingly prominent role of ABS in fields such as organizational behavior, strategy, human resources, marketing and logistics. To-date, this is the most complete survey about ABS in all management areas. © 2017, © Nelson Alfonso Gómez-Cruz, Isabella Loaiza Saa, and Francisco Fernando Ortega Hurtado.","Agent-based simulation; Complexity; Decision making; Organizational simulation; Organizational studies; Simulation as a method","","","","","","","","Andriani P., Mckelvey B., Beyond Gaussian averages: redirecting international business and management research toward extreme events and power laws, Journal of International Business Studies, 38, 7, pp. 1212-1230, (2007); Divisions & interest groups of the Academy, (2017); Axelrod R., Advancing the art of simulation in the social sciences, Complexity, 3, 2, pp. 11-22, (1997); Balke T., Gilbert N., How do agents make decisions?

Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profitability. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The research evaluation results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible. The prediction results of M-GFDT and the method itself are useful for helping advertisers to optimize their ad strategies. © 2020","Data analytics; Decision tree; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filter; Online ad","Data Analytics; Decision trees; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Pulse shaping circuits; Tunneling (excavation); Business data; Decision tree classifiers; Effectiveness evaluation; Gaussian filters; Online ad; Potential customers; Research evaluation; Two-stage methods; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","","H.

Buyer characteristics lead to the purchase of a product or service, which impacts organization profit maximization and sustainability. Therefore, organizations emphasize building strong relationship with buyers. This has become a marketing priority in the current marketing environment. In airline perspective, the Malaysian low-cost airline industry is a major contributor to the national and global economy. However, the low-cost airline industry is facing purchase decision issues on domestic traveller aspect. Thus, the objective of this research is to investigate the significant relationship between buyer characteristics and purchase decision and to examine whether situational factors act to strengthen purchase decisions. As such, this research focused on how buyer characteristics impact purchase decision. In addition, situational factors as a moderation effect on purchase decision were tested using survey questionnaire. The sample for this research was 200 low-cost Malaysian travellers. The findings of this research revealed that buyer characteristic had a significant relationship with purchase decision and the situational factor moderated to strength the model with 62.5% of prediction. Besides, it is found that the social factor had strong association with purchase decision. © 2018, Universita Putra Malaysia.","Buyer characteristics; Low-cost airline; Purchase decision; Situational factor","","","","","","","","Abdullaha K., Hazilah N., Manaf A.B., Noorc K., Measuring The Service Quality of Airline Services in Malaysia, Journal of Economics and Management, 15, (2007);

The models can be used by decision makers in a company to develop a strategy (e.g. marketing, products development) based on the prediction results. We evaluate the model using our datasets of Facebook. We collected the data by utilising Facebook API. Furthermore, we implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm to the datasets to provide a dynamic prediction of customers' purchase behaviours over time. In the preliminary evaluation, we implemented our model to the datasets with t=2. In our datasets, we found that the category, electronics, was the most favourite topic to discuss, share and like regarding electronics. Interestingly, we found that a positive direction for its trend appeared in the second run of the model. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Computational prediction model; Customer purchase behaviour; Facebook datasets; Hidden Markov Model; Strategic management","","","","","","","","Catanese S., De Meo P., Ferrara E., Fiumara G., Provetti A., Extraction and analysis of Facebook friendship relations, Computational Social Networks, pp. 291-324, (2012); Kiseleva J., Lam H.T., Pechenizkiy M., Calders T., Predicting current user intent with contextual Markov models, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW '13), (2013); Netzer O., Lattin J.M., Srinivasan V., A hidden Markov model of customer relationship dynamics, Marketing Science, 27, 2, pp. 185-204, (2008); Social Networking Fact Sheet, (2013); Sarwar B., Karypis G., Konstan J., Riedl J., Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW '01), pp. 285-295, (2001); Schafer J.B., Konstan J., Riedl J., Recommender systems in e-commerce, Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce (EC '99), pp. 158-166, (1999); Schiffman L., Kanuk L., Hansen H., Consumer Behaviour, (2012); Sen S., Vig J., Riedl J., Tagommenders: Connecting users to items through tags, Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 671-680, (2009); E-commerce.

The banking industry has undergone tremendous changes in the way business conducted. They realizes the needs and techniques of data mining which is helpful tool to gather, store, capture data and convert into knowledge. The application of data mining enhances the performance of telemarketing process in banking industry. It also provide an insight how these techniques effectively used in banking industry to make the decision making process easier and productive. This work describes a data mining approach to extract valuable knowledge and information from a bank telemarketing campaign data. At this time, the potential of five data mining methods was explored for forecasting of term deposit subscription. The presentation of these techniques was evaluated on fourteen different classifier parameters.

Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, United States","Mixed strategies are widely used to model strategic situations in diverse fields such as economics, marketing, political science, and biology. However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects. We find that the EWA learning model tracks the investment decisions of our subjects well, whether we hold out trials or an entire group of subjects.","Competitive strategy; Decision analysis; Experimental economics; Learning; Marketing; R & D","Decision theory; Game theory; Industrial economics; Industry; Investments; Marketing; Mathematical models; Patents and inventions; Product development; Research and development management; Competitive strategy; Experience-weighted attraction; Experimental economics; Learning; Competition","","","","","","","Amaldoss W., Meyer R., Raju J., Rapoport A., Collaborating to compete, Marketing Sci., 19, 2, pp. 105-126, (2000); Aumann R., Katznelson Y., Radner R., Rosenthal R.R., Weiss B., Approximate purification of mixed strategies, Math.

In truth, purchases of even the new are largely unconcious automatic responses (habits, perceptions, attitudes, roles, ect.). The difficulty the customer experiences in changing such automatic response patterns is the key to understanding the widely disparate rates of adoption and diffusion of successful new products. Forecasting the timing and speed of market growth is crucial for the introducer. A mistake in either direction is serious and may be disastrous. Fortunately, prediction of the expected speed of acceptance is possible once the role of these responses is understood. *** DIRECT SUPPORT *** A00BV020 00006 © 1980 Academy of Marketing Science.","","","","","","","","","","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","15527824","","","","English","JAMS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-51249183469"

Two different surveys administered to individual investors examine the psychological and sociological drivers of dispositional innovativeness and its effects on adoption timing and range of adoption for five new investment products. Study 1 shows that consumer psychographics (e.g., market mavenism, product-category involvement, and ambiguity intolerance) rather than socio-demographics (e.g., age, education, and risk profile) explain dispositional innovativeness and that dispositional innovativeness strongly impacts time of adoption and ownership of new investment products. Study 2 cross-validates the results of Study 1 and investigates the indirect effects of dispositional innovativeness on adoption timing through consumers' perceptions of new investment products' complexity, riskiness, and visibility (exposure to and engagement in word-of-mouth). Individuals who score high on dispositional innovativeness adopt new investment products quickly because they perceive lower complexity and greater visibility, not because they perceive lower risk. The combined results of Studies 1 and 2 show that individual investors' psychological and sociological roots systematically explain their innovative adoption behavior and indicate that - counter to standard finance predictions - they incorporate more than just risk-return trade-offs in their investment choices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer financial decision-making;

In this paper, we propose a spatial multinomial model of customer choice and illustrate how spatial modeling of choices of online customers across geographical markets provides useful insights in the context of a product mix and pricing decision of an online book publisher. The spatial multinomial model specifically accounts for the spatial correlations among customer choices among different product forms - print and PDF. The estimation results obtained using data generated from an online experiment show that the spatial model accounts for the geographical variation in many of the unobserved effects possibly due to locational differences and price sensitivities. The resultant spatial decision maps provide useful predictions as to how purchase rates vary across geographical markets as a function of the price differential between product forms, with implications for targeting customers through local market advertising, direct marketing, and cross-channel promotion. © 2005 INFORMS.","Digital products; Internet; Mixed multinomial logit; Pricing; Spatial model","","","","","","","","Breslow N.E., Clayton D.G., Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models, J.

As predicted by the human capital model, we propose that the key determinant of demand for hedonic experiences is the increase in performance efficiency that can be gained through practice. In addition, we argue that the nature of the effect of practice is distinctly different in hedonic consumption, compared to utilitarian consumption. Specifically, for hedonic experiences, practice allows consumers to extract greater value within a given period of time, rather than reduce the amount of time spent on a (utilitarian) task. Finally, we argue that if changes in performance efficiency across repeated hedonic experiences adhere to the power law of practice, then both prior knowledge and task difficulty will be important moderators of the main effect of practice on demand. These predictions are tested in two experiments that use an online panel to examine consumer demand for videogames. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.","Decision making; Experience; Hedonic products;

Design/methodology/approachThe research adopted the method of structured content analysis and carried out the survey in Chinese home appliance industry, mainly covering the largest firms, including TCL, Hisense, Changhong, Konka, Haier, and Skyworth. The method of multiple regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. FindingsThe results show that in order to comprehensively forecast competitor's responding behaviors, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market. Additionally, in the process of dynamic interaction, the attacking or responding action is not independent and it is related significantly to another three type decisions, which are market and non-market, strategic and tactic, and collective and individual. Further, the study asserts that, in market field, tactic activity is more likely to trigger competitor's response than strategic one, while in non-market, the situation is just the opposite. Meanwhile, the study figured out that individual market attack is easier to trigger individual market and non-market response, as well as collective market response. While for non-market action, whatever it is individual or collective, both would be easy to provoke competitor's collective response. Originality/valueThe research findings extend the existing competitive interaction theory to non-market field. When forecasting competitor's choice of the competitive action, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market, attaching importance to certain situation of competitor's taking such non-market action as corporate philanthropy, etc. to launch an attack or a response for gaining competitive advantage. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Competitive advantage; Marketing strategy","","","","","","Hubei Social Science Fund Project, ([2010]047); Social Science of the Humanities Program of MOE, (09YJC630177); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (70902053); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (7082003)","This research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Projects No.: 70902053), The Social Science of the Humanities Program of MOE, PRC (09YJC630177), The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (7082003), and the “11th Five-year Plan” of Hubei Social Science Fund Project (Projects No.: [2010]047).","Abell D.F., Defining the Business: The Starting Point of Strategic Planning, (1980); Ansoff I., Corporate Strategy, (1965); Ansoff I., Implanting Strategic Management, (1994); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J., Hansen M.H., Trustworthiness as a source of competitive advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 15, pp. 175-190, (1994); Baron D.P., Integrated strategy: market and non-market components, California Management Review, 37, 2, pp. 47-65, (1995); Baron D.P., Integrated strategy: trade policy and global competition, California Management Review, 39, 2, pp. 145-169, (1997); Baron D.P., Integrated market and non-market strategies in client and interest group politics, Business and Politics, 1, 7, pp. 7-34, (1999); Baron D.P., Private politics, corporate social responsibility, and integrated strategy, Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 10, 11, pp. 7-45, (2001); Boddewyn J., Political aspects of MNE theory, Journal of international business studies, Fall, pp. 341-363, (1988); Chen M., Competitive strategic interaction: a study of competitive actions and responses, (1988); Chen X., Dynamical competitive strategy and Chinese firms, Chemical and Technological Economics, 3, pp. 13-20, (2000); Chen M.J., Hambrick D.C., Competitive attack, reltaliation and performance an empectancy-valence framework, Strategic Management Journal, 15, 2, pp. 85-102, (1994); Chen M.J., Hambrick D.C., Speed, stealth, and selective attack: how small firms differ from large firms in competitive behavior, Academy of Management Journal, 38, 2, pp. 453-482, (1995); Chen M., MacMillan I., Nonresponse and delayed response to competitive moves: the roles of competitor dependence and action irreversibility, Academy of Management Journal, 35, pp. 359-370, (1992); Chen M., Miller D., Competitive attack, retaliation and performance: an expectancy -valence framework, Strategic Management Journal, 15, 2, pp. 85-102, (1994); Chen M., Smith K., Grimm C., Action characteristics as predictors of competitive responses, Management Science, 38, 4, pp. 439-455, (1992); D'Aveni R.A., Hyper-competition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, (1994); Dutton J., Duncan R., The creation of momentum for change through the process of strategic diagnosis, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 8, pp. 76-90, (1987); Dutton J.E., Jackson S.E., Categorizing strategic issues: links to organizational action, Academy of Management Review, 12, 1, pp. 76-90, (1987); Fombrun C., Shanley M., What's in a name?

This paper aims to present a methodology to build cannibalization effects into forecasting models as measured through product attributes. It follows on from a paper by the same authors in Vol. 23 No. 4. Design/methodology/approach - The contribution of product attributes to cannibalization is tested by a series of hypotheses, then integrated into the proposed cannibalization model. Results are compared with predictions from an ARIMA-based model and actual historical sales data. Findings - The proposed model improves on the fidelity of ARIMA-based models, by between 16 and 42 percent. Originality/value - Effective prediction of cannibalization losses will allow marketing planners to make better-informed decisions with respect to new product introduction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forecasting; Market share; New products; Quantitative methods","","","","","","","","Box G.E.P., Jenkins G.M., Reinsel G.C., Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, (1994); Buday T., Capitalizing on brand extensions, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 6, 4, pp. 27-30, (1989); Carpenter G.S., Hanssens D.M., Market expansion, cannibalization, and international airline pricing strategy, Journal of Forecasting, 10, 2, pp. 313-327, (1994); Chen M., Yu C., The marketing of hi-end or low-end versions of a product: Which should be launched first?, International Journal of Management, 18, 4, pp. 459-472, (2001); Copulsky W., Cannibalism in the marketplace, Journal of Marketing, 2, pp. 103-105, (1976); Cravens D.W., Piercy N.F., Prentice A., Developing market-driven product strategies, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 9, 6, pp. 369-385, (2000); Gilmore C.G., McManus G.M., Random-walk and efficiency tests of central European equity markets, Managerial Finance, 29, 4, pp. 42-61, (2003); Hanke J.E., Wichern D.W., Reitsch A.G., Business Forecasting, (2001); Heskett J., Marketing, (1976); Hui K.L., Product variety under brand influence: An empirical investigation of personal computer demand, (2003); Kerin R.A., Harvey M.G., Rothe J.T., Cannibalism and new product development, Business Horizons, 21, 5, pp. 25-31, (1978); Kim K., Chhajed D., Commonality in product design: Cost saving, valuation change and cannibalization, European Journal of Operational Research, 125, 3, pp. 602-621, (2000); Kim K., Chhajed D., An experimental investigation of valuation change due to commonality in vertical product line extension, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 18, 4, pp. 219-230, (2001); Krishnan V., Gupta S., Appropriateness and impact of platform-based product development, Management Science, 47, 1, pp. 52-68, (2001); Litterman R., Forecasting with Bayesian vector autoregressions - Five years of experience, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 4, 1, pp. 25-38, (1986); Lomax W., The measurement of cannibalization, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 14, 7, pp. 20-32, (1996); Lomax W., Hammond K., East R., Clemete M., The measurement of cannibalization, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 6, 1, pp. 27-39, (1997); Mason C.H., Milne G.R., An approach for identifying cannibalization within product line extensions and multi-brand strategies, Journal of Business Research, 31, 2, pp. 267-281, (1994); Mazumdar T., Sivakumar K., Wilemon D., Launching new products with cannibalization potential: An optimal timing framework, Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 4, 3, pp. 83-93, (1996); Meredith L., Maki D., Product cannibalization and the role of prices, Allied Economics, 33, 14, pp. 1785-1793, (2001); Nadler D., How the big get better: Managing for growth, Human Resource Planning, 20, 1, pp. 11-13, (1997); Rosenfield J.R., Whatever happened to relationship marketing?

This study aims to investigate the factors that predict consumer intention to adopt m-commerce in Malaysia and China. The work extends the traditional technology acceptance model (TAM) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) model, and includes additional variables such as trust, cost, social influence, variety of services, and control variables such as age, educational level, and gender of consumers. By comparing consumers from both Malaysia and China, this research is able to form a prediction model based on two different cultural settings. Data was collected from 172 Malaysian consumers and 222 Chinese consumers, and hierarchical regression analysis was employed to test the research model. The results showed that age, trust, cost, social influence, and variety of services are able to predict Malaysian consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. Trust, cost, and social influence can be used to predict Chinese consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. This research confirms the need to extend the traditional TAM and DOI models when studying technology such as m-commerce. The results from this study will be useful for telecommunication and m-commerce companies in formulating marketing strategies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Sales promotions","","","","","","","","Ailawadi K., Pauwels K., Steenkamp J.E.M., Private-label use and store loyalty, Journal of Marketing, 72, pp. 19-30, (2008); Allenby Greg M., Rossi P.E., Quality perceptions and asymmetric switching between brands, Marketing Science, 10, 3, pp. 185-204, (1991); Azar Ofer H., Relative thinking theory, Journal of Socio-Economies, 36, 1, pp. 1-14, (2007); Blattberg Robert C., Briesch R., Fox E.J., How promotions work, Marketing Science, 14, 3, (1995); Wisniewski K.J., Price-induced patterns of competition, Marketing Science, 8, 4, pp. 291-309, (1989); Camerer C.F., Hua-Ho T., Violations of the betweenness axiom and nonlinearity in probability, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 8, 2, pp. 167-196, (1994); Chen H., Rao A.R., When two plus two is not equal to four: Errors in processing multiple percentage changes, Journal of Consumer Research, 34, 3, pp. 327-340, (1997); Darke Peter R., Freedman J.L., Deciding whether to seek a bargain: Effects of both amount and percentage off, Journal of Applied Psychology, 78, 6, pp. 960-965, (1993); Delvecchio D., Shanker Krishnan H., Smith D.C., Cents or percent?

Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a contextfree partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Behavioral decision making;

We showed experimentally that, for this example, as long as aggregation does not shrink the sample size unduly, it does not significantly impair the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting the direction of the DJIA stock market index. We also observed that aggregation-based models are simpler (less over-parameterized) than detail-based models. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the robustness of such predictive models. Specifically, we used the area under the ROC curve as a summary measure of the overall performance of a given model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Discovering the process of choice of the customers serves as a basis for many marketing decisions such as new product planning, advertising message selection, product positioning, pricing, concept testing, sales forecasting, benefit segmentation, personal selling strategy formulation, etc. The multiattribute models proposed for this purpose can be grouped into two classes: (i) models based on mathematical programming techniques, and (ii) models based on statistical techniques. The recent literature surveys indicate that the results obtained from linear programming models show greater stability and better predictive ability. In this study therefore we will concentrate only on the mathematical programming methods of estimation in general and on a new market share prediction model in particular. The main feature of the proposed model is that it recognizes the dependence of attribute weights on attribute scores through a step function. The predictive ability of the model is discussed via a hypothetical numerical example. © 1989.","Market share; Mathematical programming; Multiattribute choice","","","","","","","","Bell, Keeney, Little, A market share theorem, Journal of Marketing Research, 12, pp. 136-141, (1975); Birnbaum, The nonadditivity of personality impressions, Journal of Experimental Psychology Monograph, 102, pp. 543-561, (1974); Buzzell, Gale, Sultan, Market share - A key to profitability, Harvard Business Review, pp. 97-104, (1975); Carmone, Green, Model missecification in multiattribute parameter estimation, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 87-93, (1981); Dominique, Oral, An analytical approach to competitive strategy formulation in mature industries, Document de travail 86-41, Faculté des sciences de l'administration, (1986); Givon, Horsky, Market share models as approximators of aggregated heterogeneous brand choice behavior, Management Science, 24, 13, pp. 1404-1416, (1978); Green, Carmone, Evaluation of multiattribute alternatives Additive versus configural utility measurement, Decision Sciences, 5, pp. 164-181, (1974); Hammermesh, Andersen, Harris, Strategies for low market share business, Harvard Business Review, pp. 95-102, (1978); Horsky, Rao, Estimation of attribute weights from preference comparisons, Management Science, 30, 7, pp. 801-822, (1984); Jain, Acito, Malhotra, Mahajan, A Comparison of the internal validity of alternative parameter estimation methods in decomposional multi-attribute preference models, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, pp. 313-322, (1979); Karnani, Equilibrium market share - A measure of competitive strength, Strategic Management Journal, 3, pp. 43-51, (1982); Karnani, Strategic implications of market share models, Management Science, 31, 5, pp. 536-547, (1985); Kruskal, Analysis of factorial experiments by estimating monotone transformations of data, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 27, pp. 1-27, (1965); Lynch, Why additive utility models fail as descriptions of choice behavior, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 15, pp. 397-417, (1979); Lynch, Uniqueness issues in the decompositional modeling of multiattribute overall evaluations An information integration perspective, Journal of Marketing Research, 22, pp. 1-19, (1985); McFadden, Conditional logit analysis of qualitative choice behavior, Frontiers in Econometrics, (1974); Meyer, A model of multiattribute Judgments under attribute uncertainty and informational constraint, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 428-441, (1981); Mustafi, Xavier, Mixed-integer linear-programming formulation of a multi-attribute threshold model of choice, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 36, 10, pp. 935-942, (1985); Naert, Bultez, Logically consistent market share models, Journal of Marketing Research, 10, pp. 334-340, (1973); Naert, Weverbergh, On the prediction power of market share attraction models, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 146-153, (1982); Oral, Forecasting industrial competitiveness: A framework, International Journal of Forecasting, 1, 1, pp. 49-61, (1985); Oral, An industrial competitiveness model, IIE Transactions, 18, 2, pp. 148-157, (1986); Oral, A model-based approach to strategic planning for competitive advantage, Document de travail 86-41 Faculté des sciences de l'administration, (1986); Oral, Ozkan, An empirical study on measuring industrial competitiveness, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 37, 4, pp. 345-354, (1986); Pekelman, Sen, Improving prediction in conjoint measurement, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, pp. 211-220, (1979); Shocker, Srinivasan, Multiattribute approaches for product concept evaluation and generation A critical review, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, pp. 159-180, (1979); Srinivasan, Shocker, Estimating the weights for multiple attributes in a composite criterion using pairwise judgments, Psychometrica, 38, pp. 473-493, (1973); Srinivasan, Shocker, Linear programming techniques for multi-dimensional analysis of preferences, Psychometrica, 38, pp. 337-369, (1973); Stewart, Inferring preferences in multiple criteria decision analysis using a logistic regression model, Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1067-1077, (1984); Wilkie, Pessemier, Issues in marketing's use of multi-attribute attitude models, Journal of Marketing Research, 10, pp. 428-441, (1973); Wittink, Cattin, Alternative estimation methods for conjoint analysis A Monte Carlo study, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 101-106, (1981); Woo, Evaluation of the strategies and performance of low ROI market share leaders, Strategic Management Journal, 4, pp. 123-135, (1983)","","","","","","","","","01692070","","IJFOE","","English","Int.

However the evolution of price-quality data available from Consumer Reports over the last 15 years seems to reveal a reduction of the quality gap between store brands and national brands, while price differences remain substantial. Simultaneously, the share of private label brands has increased (Progressive Grocer 1994). In this context, we study whether we can maintain a view of the world where national brands may easily attract consumers from store brands through promotions, whereas store brands are relatively ineffective in attracting consumers from national brands by such means. We analyze consumer reactions to price discounts in a parsimonious preference model featuring loss aversion and reference-dependence along dimensions of price and quality (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993, Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The key result of our analysis is that, given any two brands, there is an asymmetric promotion effect in favor of the higher quality /higher price brands if and only if the quality gap between the brands is sufficiently large in comparison with the price gap. Thus, the direction of promotion asymmetry is not unconditional. It depends uniquely on the value of the ratio of quality and price differences compared to a category specific criterion, which we call Φ. If the ratio of quality and price differences is larger than this criterion, the usual asymmetry prevails; if such is not the case, the lower quality/ lower price brands promote more effectively. More precisely, our model predicts that cross promotion effects depend on two components of brand positioning in the price/quality quadrant. First, we define a variable termed ""positioning advantage"" that indicates whether, relative to the standards achieved by another brand, a given brand is under-priced (positive advantage) or overpriced (negative advantage). Promotion effectiveness is increasing in this variable. Second, cross promotion effects between two brands depend on their distance in the price/quality quadrant. This variable impacts promotion effectiveness negatively and symmetrically for any pair of brands. ""Positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance"" are orthogonal components of brand positioning, irrespective of the degree of correlation between available price and quality levels in the market. Empirically, we investigate the role of brand positioning in explaining cross promotion effects using panel data from the chilled orange juice and peanut butter categories. We compute the independent positioning variables, ""positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance,"" from readily available data on price and quality positioning after obtaining our estimates of Φ. We next measure promotion effectiveness by estimating choice share changes in response to a price discount, using a choice model that does not contain any information about quality/price ratios. Finally, we test the relation between the two positioning variables and the promotion effectiveness measures. The data reveal that in the orange juice category lower quality/lower price brands generally promote more effectively than higher quality/higher price brands. In the peanut butter data the opposite asymmetry holds. In both cases, inter-brand promotion patterns are well explained by the positioning variables. An attractive feature of our model is that, in addition to the direction of promotion asymmetries, it also explains the extent of those asymmetries. A further interesting aspect of this approach is that we go beyond a categorization of brands into price tiers. For instance, lower tier brands in our data may promote more effectively than one national brand but less effectively than another. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the data presented here seem to confirm that such cases occur because the lower tier brand offers a favorable trade-off of price and quality differences compared with one national brand and a less favorable trade-off compared with the other. The content of this paper is potentially relevant for brand managers or retailers concerned with predicting the impact of their promotions. The paper is of particular interest to marketing scientists who study the performance of store brands versus national brands and may also appeal to those who wish to explore the marketing implications of behavioral decision theory. Finally, our investigation does not reject Blattberg and Wisniewski's (1989) finding, shared by Allenby and Rossi (1991) and Hardie, Johnson, and Fader (1993), that national brands have a principle advantage in promotion effectiveness. Rather, it formalizes when this principle advantage is overruled by positioning disadvantages of such brands.","Brand choice; Brand positioning; Loss aversion; Promotion; Reference-dependence","","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Rossi P.E., Quality perceptions and asymmetric switching between brands, Marketing Science, 10, SUMMER, pp. 185-204, (1991); Blattberg R.C., Wisniewski K.J., Price-induced patterns of competition, Marketing Science, 8, FALL, pp. 291-309, (1989); Briesch R., Fox E.J., How promotions work, Marketing Science, 14, (1995); The nuttiest peanut butter, Consumer Reports, SEPTEMBER, pp. 588-591, (1990); Erdem T., Keane M.P., Decision making under uncertainty: Capturing dynamic brand choice processes in turbulent consumer good markets, Marketing Science, 15, pp. 1-21, (1996); Fader P.S., Lattin J.M., Little J.D.C., Estimating nonlinear parameters in the multinomial logit model, Marketing Science, 11, FALL, pp. 372-385, (1992); Guadagni P.M., Little J.D.C., A logit model of brand choice calibrated on scanner data, Marketing Science, 2, SUMMER, pp. 203-238, (1983); Hardie B.G.S., Johnson E.J., Fader P.S., Modeling loss aversion and reference dependence effects on brand choice, Marketing Science, 12, FALL, pp. 378-394, (1993); Heath T.B., Chatterjee S., Asymmetric decoy effects on lower-quality versus higher-quality brands: Meta analytic and experimental evidence, Journal of Consumer Research, 22, DECEMBER, pp. 268-284, (1995); Kahneman D., Knetsch J.L., Thaler R.H., The endowment effect, loss aversion and status quo bias, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 5, pp. 193-206, (1991); Kamakura W.A., Russell G.J., A probabilistic choice model for market segmentation and elasticity structure, Journal of Marketing Research, 26, NOVEMBER, pp. 379-390, (1989); Keane M.P., Modelling Heterogeneity and State Dependence in Consumer Choice Behavior; Nowlis S.M., Simonson I., The Effect of Choice Set Composition on Consumer Response to Sales Promotions, (1995); A matter of interpretation, Progressive Grocer, pp. 20-26, (1994); Samuelson W., Zeckhauser R., Status quo biases in decision making, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 1, pp. 7-59, (1988); Tversky A., Kahneman D., Loss aversion in riskless choice: A reference-dependent model, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106, pp. 1039-1061, (1991); Winer R.S., A reference price model of brand choice for frequently purchased products, Journal of Consumer Research, 13, SEPTEMBER, pp. 250-257, (1986)","","","Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences","","","","","","07322399","","","","English","Mark.

The resulting marketing and engineering design goals are driven by consumer preferences and engineering capabilities, two issues that conveniently are addressed in isolation from one another. This convenient isolation, however, typically will not result in optimal product decisions when the two problems are interrelated. A method new to the marketing community, analytical target cascading (ATC), is adopted here to explore such interrelationships and to formalize the process of coordinating marketing and engineering design problems in a way that is proven to yield the joint optimal solution. The ATC model is built atop well-established marketing methodologies, such as conjoint, discrete choice modeling and demand forecasting. The method is demonstrated in the design of dial-readout household scales, using real conjoint choice data and a parametric engineering product design model. Results indicate that the most profitable achievable product can fall short of predictions based on marketing alone but well ahead of what engineering may produce based on original marketing target specifications. A number of extensions can be accomplished readily using techniques from the extant marketing and design optimization literature.","","Data reduction; Decision making; Marketing; Mathematical models;

In this article, the author argues that the Olshavsky and Acito results do not lead one to believe that the compensatory conjoint models can be potentially more misleading than models that try to represent more accurately the underlying evaluation process with noncompensatory and compensatory rules. Hence, it does not seem necessary to try to identify noncompensatory rules in a conjoint study. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

Design/methodology/approach - First, the literature on inaction inertia - the lowering of the likelihood that a bargain will be taken once a better bargain has been missed - is reviewed. Second, the literature on affective self-forecasting is reviewed. Finally, the implications that the authors synthesis of the behavioural evidence carries for marketing are discussed. Findings - The in action inertia literature implicates the regret that consumers associate with purchasing a discounted item once they have missed a much larger discount on it as a major contributing factor to consumers' unwillingness to purchase the item on the second occasion. The literature on affective self-prediction suggests that regret (and other emotions) is systematically mispredicted. Research limitations/implications - The likely effect of erroneously anticipated regret in inaction inertia situations is depressed purchasing behaviour. The paper argues that because affective anticipations are typically erroneous, their impact on consumer decision-making processes cannot be deemed rational. It is proposed that marketing should intervene to either increase the accuracy of such anticipations, or to lead consumers to discount them. Practical implications - Price promotions can have negative side effects, such as those observed in inaction inertia circumstances. To some extent, these are driven by consumers anticipated regret (and possibly other relevant emotions). Marketing techniques can counteract the disproportionate impact of such emotions. Originality/value - The paper offers a synthesis of behavioural evidence on inaction inertia and affective self-forecasting - two quite separate literatures that have yet to be brought together in the present context. In addition, the paper outlines implications for marketing and suggests possible strategies to moderate the discussed effects.","Advertising; Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Pricing; Sales forecasting","","","","","","","","Arkes H.R., Kung Y.H., Hutzel L., Regret, valuation, and inaction inertia, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 87, pp. 371-385, (2002); Butler A., Highhouse S., Deciding to sell: The effect of prior inaction and offer source, Journal of Economic Psychology, 21, pp. 223-232, (2000); Connolly T., Butler D., Regret in economic and psychological theories of choice, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 19, pp. 139-154, (2006); Connolly T., Zeelenberg M., Regret in decision making, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 11, pp. 212-216, (2002); Dekimpe M.G., Hanssens D.M., Nijs V.R., Steenkamp J.B.E.M., Measuring short- and long-run promotional effectiveness on scanner data using persistence modelling, Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry, 21, pp. 409-416, (2005); Gilbert D.T., Morewedge C.K., Risen J.L., Wilson T.D., Looking forward to looking backward: The misprediction of regret, Psychological Science, 15, pp. 346-350, (2004); Jedidi K., Mela C.F., Gupta S., Managing adverising and promotion for long-run profitability, Marketing Science, 18, pp. 1-22, (1999); Kahneman D., Snell J., Predicting a changing taste: Do people know what they will like?, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 5, pp. 187-200, (1992); Kumar P., The effects of social comparison on inaction inertia, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 95, pp. 175-185, (2004); Landman J., Regret: The Persistence of the Possible, (1993); Loewenstein G., O'Donoghue T., Rabin M., Projection bias in predicting future utility, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, pp. 1209-1248, (2003); Mela C.F., Gupta S., Lehmann D.R., The long-term impact of promotion and advertising on consumer brand choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, pp. 248-261, (1997); Mellers B., Schwartz A., Ho K., Ritov I., Decision affect theory: Emotional reactions to the outcomes of risky options, Psychological Science, 8, pp. 423-429, (1997); Mitchell T.R., Thompson L., Peterson E., Cronk R., Temporal adjustments in the evaluation of events: The 'rosy view', Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 33, pp. 421-448, (1997); Papatla P., Krishnamurthi L., Measuring the dynamic effects of promotions on brand choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 33, pp. 20-35, (1996); Schkade D.A., Kahneman D., Does living in California make people happy?

Some of its predictions, therefore, must be sensitive to the strong simplifications of this paradigm. This is why it seems useful to identify, discuss and evaluate those simplifications as they exist to-day. Toward this end, we compare models of choice behaviour in economics, including the most recent ones, with a standard paradigm of consumer behaviour in psychology and marketing. This comparison can give us a rather good measure of distance between experienced behaviour and economic behaviour, which is used as a basis in some parts of theoretical economic geography.","Choice behaviour; Economic geography; Modelling; Theoretical geography","choice behaviour; decision making; economic theory; psychology; theory","","","","","","","Akerlof G., The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 89, pp. 488-500, (1970); Becker G., Murphy K.M., A Simple Theory of Advertisement as Good or Bad, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108, pp. 941-964, (1993); Bettman J.R., An Information Processing Theory of Consumer Choice, (1979); Boyer C.B., A History of Mathematics, (1985); Caldwell B., Beyond Positivism: Economic Methodology in the Twentieth Century, (1982); Cohen M.D., Axelrod R., Coping with complexity: The adaptive value of changing utility, American Economic Review, 74, pp. 30-42, (1984); De Palma A., Myers G.M., Papageorgiou Y.Y., Rational choice under an imperfect ability to choose, American Economic Review, 84, 3, pp. 419-440, (1994); Friedman M., The methodology of positive economics, Essays in Positive Economics, pp. 3-43, (1953); Fudenberg D., Tirole J., Game Theory, (1991); Green J., Laffont J.-J., Incentives in Public Decision Making, (1979); Heiner R.A., The origin of predictable behavior, American Economic Review, 73, pp. 560-595, (1983); Herrnstein, Experiments on stable suboptimality in individual behavior, American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 81, pp. 360-364, (1991); Hirshleifer J., Riley J.G., The analysis of uncertainty and information.

Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models managerially more useful. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Customer base analysis; Customer management; Direct marketing; Heuristics; Relationship marketing","","","","","","","","","M.

The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","","","","","","","","","Arora A., Fosfuri A., Pricing Diagnostic Information, Management Science, 51, 7, pp. 1092-1100, (2005); Bakos J.Y., Brynjolfsson E., Bundling Information Goods: Pricing Profits and Efficiency, Management Science, 45, 12, pp. 1613-1630, (1999); Bakos J.Y., Brynjolfsson E., Bundling and Competition on the Internet, Marketing Science, 19, 1, pp. 63-82, (2000); Christen M., Research Note: Cost Uncertainty Is Bliss: The Effect of Competition on the Acquisition of Cost Information for Pricing New Products, Management Science, 51, 4, pp. 668-677, (2005); Chu W., Messinger P.R., Information and Channel Profits, Journal of Retailing, 73, 4, pp. 487-499, (1997); Connolly T., Serre P., Information Search in Judgment Tasks: The Effects of Unequal Cue Validity and Cost, Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 34, pp. 387-401, (1984); Deshpande R., Zaltman G., Factors Affecting the Use of Market Research Information: A Path Analysis, Journal of Marketing Research, 19, pp. 14-31, (1982); Deshpande R., Zaltman G., A Comparison of Factors Affecting Researcher and Manager Perceptions of Market Research Use, Journal of Marketing Research, 21, pp. 32-38, (1984); Einhorn H.J., Hogarth R.M., Behavioral Decision Theory: Processes of Judgment and Choice, Annual Review of Psychology, 32, pp. 53-88, (1981); Gerstner E., Do Higher Prices Signal Higher Quality?, Journal of Marketing Research, 22, pp. 209-215, (1985); Glazer R., Steckel J.H., Winer R.S., The Formation of Key Marketing Variable Expectations and Their Impact on Firm Performance: Some Experimental Evidence, Marketing Science, 8, 1, pp. 18-34, (1989); Glazer R., Steckel J.H., Winer R.S., Locally Rational Decision Making: The Distracting Effect of Information on Managerial Performance, Management Science, 38, 2, pp. 212-226, (1992); Ho T.H., Lim N., Camerer C.F., Modeling the Psychology of Consumer and Firm Behavior with Behavioral Economics, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, pp. 307-331, (2006); Holbert N.A., How Managers See Market Research, Journal of Advertising Research, 14, pp. 41-46, (1974); Iyer G., Soberman D., Markets for Product Modification Information, Marketing Science, 19, 3, pp. 203-226, (2000); Jensen F.O., Information Services, The AMA Handbook of Marketing for the Service Industries, pp. 423-443, (1991); Krum J.R., B for Marketing Research Departments, Journal of Marketing, 42, pp. 8-12, (1978); Larreche J., Gatignon H., MARKSTRAT 3, (1998); McKelvey R.D., Page T., Public and Private Information: An Experimental Study of Information Pooling, Econometrica, 58, 6, pp. 1321-1339, (1990); Moorman C., Deshpande R., Zaltman G., Factors Affecting Trust in Market Research Relationships, Journal of Marketing, 57, pp. 81-101, (1993); Ofek E., Sarvary M., Leveraging the Customer Base: Creating Competitive Advantage Through Knowledge Management, Management Science, 47, 11, pp. 1441-1456, (2001); Patterson P.G., Choice Criteria in the Final Selection of a Management Consultancy Service, Journal of Professional Services Marketing, 11, 2, pp. 177-187, (1995); Raju J.S., Roy A., Market Information and Firm Performance, Management Science, 46, 8, pp. 1075-1084, (2000); Rotheli T.F., Acquisition of Cost Information: An Experimental Study, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 46, 2, pp. 193-208, (2001); Sarvary M., Temporal Differentiation and the Market for Second Opinions, Journal of Marketing Research, 39, pp. 129-136, (2002); Sarvary M., Parker P.M., Marketing Information: A Competitive Analysis, Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 24-38, (1997); Schoemaker P., Preferences for Information on Probabilities Versus Prizes: The Role of Risk-Taking Attitudes, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 2, 1, pp. 37-60, (1989); Slovic P., Fischhoff B., Lichtenstein S., Behavioral Decision Theory, Annual Review of Psychology, 28, pp. 1-39, (1977); Sunder S., Market for Information: Experimental Evidence, Econometrica, 60, pp. 667-695, (1992); Villas-Boas M.J., Sleeping with the Enemy: Should Competitors Share the Same Advertising Agency?, Marketing Science, 13, 2, pp. 190-202, (1994); Villas-Boas M.J., Winer R.S., Endogeneity in Brand Choice Models, Management Science, 45, 10, pp. 1324-1338, (1999); Violino B., Levin R., Analyzing the Analysts, Information Week, pp. 38-56, (1997); Winkler R., Combining Probability Distributions from Dependent Information Sources, Management Science, 27, 4, pp. 479-488, (1981); Xiang Y., Sarvary M., Pricing Information: The Interaction of Competitive Externality and Information Quality, (2005)","M.

However, knowledge of this increasingly important domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities, competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to structure-conduct-performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance. However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages realized.","","","","","","","","","Aaby N.-E., Slater S.F., Managerial Influences on Export Performance: A Review of the Empirical Literature, 1978-88, International Marketing Review, 6, 4, pp. 53-68, (1989); Aaker D., Managing Assets and Skills: The Key to Sustainable Competitive Advantage, California Management Review, 31, 2, pp. 91-106, (1989); Ambler T., Styles C., Xiucum W., The Effect of Channel Relationships and Guanxi on the Performance of Interprovince Export Ventures in the People's Republic of China, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 16, 1, pp. 75-87, (1999); Amit R., Shoemaker P.J.H., Strategic Assets and Organizational Rents, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Anderson E.W., Fornell C., Lehmann D.R., Customer Satisfaction, Market Share, and Profitability: Findings from Sweden, Journal of Marketing, 58, JULY, pp. 53-66, (1994); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, AUGUST, pp. 396-402, (1977); Aulakh P.S., Kotabe M., Teegen H., Export Strategies and Performance of Firms from Emerging Economies: Evidence from Brazil, Chile and Mexico, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 3, pp. 342-361, (2000); Axinn C.N., Introduction: International Perspectives on Export Marketing, Advances in International Marketing, 6, (1994); Bagozzi R.P., Measurement in Marketing Research: Basic Principles of Questionnaire Design, Principles of Marketing Research, pp. 1-49, (1994); Yi Y., On the Evaluation of Structural Equation Models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Phillips L.W., Assessing Construct Validity in Organizational Research, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 3, pp. 421-458, (1991); Barney J.B., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bello D.C., Gilliland D.I., The Effects of Output Controls, Process Controls, and Flexibility on Export Channel Performance, Journal of Marketing, 61, JANUARY, pp. 22-38, (1997); Urban D., Verhage B.J., Evaluating Export Middlemen in Alternative Channel Structures, International Marketing Review, 8, 5, pp. 49-64, (1991); Bentler P.M., EQS Structural Equations Program Manual, (1995); Chou C.-P., Practical Issues in Structural Modeling, Sociological Methods and Research, 16, 1, pp. 78-117, (1987); Bharadwaj S.G., Rajan Varadarajan P., Fahy J., Sustainable Competitive Advantage in Service Industries: A Conceptual Model and Research Propositions, Journal of Marketing, 51, OCTOBER, pp. 83-99, (1993); Black J.A., Boal K.B., Strategic Resources: Traits, Configurations, and Paths to Sustainable Competitive Advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 15, SPEC.

Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study 1 show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Consumer behaviour; International business","","","","","","","","Age A., Politics' effect on bottom line, Chicago/Midwest Regional Edition, 66, 37, (1995); Anderson J.C., David W.G., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423, (1988); Arnott N., Marketing with a passion, Sales and Marketing Management, 146, pp. 64-71, (1994); Bagozzi R.P., Marketing as exchange, Journal of Marketing, 39, pp. 32-39, (1975); Barton L., Crisis in Organizations: Managing and Communicating in the Heat of Crisis, (1993); Bilkey W., Nes E., Country of origin effects on product evaluations, Journal of International Business Studies, pp. 89-99, (1982); Bloom P.N., Pattie Y.H., Lisa S., An assessment of corporate social marketing programs, Proceedings for the 1995 Society for Consumer Psychology Conference, Role of Advertising in Social Marketing, (1995); Brown T.J., Dacin P.A., The company and the product: Corporate associations and consumer product responses, Journal of Marketing, 61, pp. 68-84, (1997); Korea B., Civic groups launch boycott against French goods over nuclear tests, Business Korea, 12, 11, (1995); Darling J.R., Arnold D.R., The competitive position abroad of products and marketing practices of the United States, Japan, and selected European countries, The Journal of Consumer Marketing, 5, pp. 61-68, (1988); Darling J.R., Wood V.R., A longitudinal study comparing perceptions of US and Japanese consumer products in a third/neutral country: Finland 1975 to 1985, Journal of International Business Studies, 20, pp. 427-450, (1989); Drumwright M.E., Company advertising with a social dimension: The role of noneconomic criteria, Journal of Marketing, 60, pp. 71-87, (1996); Elsbach K.D., Managing organizational legitimacy in the Californian cattle industry: The construction and effectiveness of verbal accounts, Administrative Science Quarterly, 329, 1, (1994); Elsbach K.D., Sutton R., Acquiring organizational legitimacy through illegitimate actions: A marriage of institutional and impression management theories, Academy of Management Journal, 35, 4, pp. 699-738, (1992); Freidman M., Consumer boycotts: A conceptual framework and research agenda, Journal of Social Issues, 47, 1, pp. 149-168, (1991); Friedman M., Consumer Boycotts: Effecting Change Through the Marketplace and the Media, (1999); (1996); Garrett D., The effectiveness of marketing policy boycotts: Environmental opposition to marketing, Journal of Marketing, 51, pp. 46-57, (1987); Gelb B., More boycotts ahead?

The paper also seeks to establish a KM and aCRM based framework using data mining (DM) techniques, which helps in the enterprise decision-making. The objective is to share how KM and aCRM can be integrated into this seamless analytics framework to sustain excellence in decision making using effective data mining techniques and to explore how working on such aCRM system can be effective for enabling organizations delivering complete solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on focused and dedicated study of the literature present on the aCRM, KM and data mining techniques. The paper considered how to develop a strategy and operational framework that would build aCRM on the foundation of existing DM techniques and KM approach to meet the business challenges. Based on this research, a customized, integrated framework, to match the needs of business was designed. Findings: KM focuses on managing knowledge within the organization and aCRM focuses on gaining analytical information from the customer data. Both KM and aCRM help in the decision making process and understanding. This knowledge is difficult to uncover. Hence, this paper explains the importance of data mining tools and techniques to uncover knowledge by the integration between KM and aCRM. This paper presents an integrated KM and aCRM based framework using DM techniques. Research limitations/implications: All the firms may not be in favor of adopting KM while implementing aCRM. The KM requires a convalesce of organizational culture, technology innovations, effective work force in culminating knowledge dissemination in all business domains. Practical implications: The organizations implementing this knowledge enabled aCRM framework would be easily able to convert their business knowledge via the analytical CRM to solve many business issues, such as increase response rates from direct mail, telephone, e-mail, and internet delivered marketing campaigns, increased sales and increased services. With aCRM, firms can identify their most profitable customers and use this knowledge for promotional schemes for those customers as well as identify future customers with prediction on ROI. Originality/value: The need for the integration of KM and aCRM is clear. It is written for practitioners who are looking for approaches to improve business performance and maintain high profits for their business by incorporating knowledge-enabled aCRM in their setup. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business analysis;

Yet the accessible literature in this area is rather limited. Of particular interest is the assessment of the extent to which behaviour is entirely volitional and thus completely under the physician's control. This would determine the extent to which external stimuli, such as communications from the pharmaceutical industry and the media, have any influence or not. On the basis of a small-scale study with 38 physicians in Greece, the importance of isolating normative beliefs and the motivation to comply has been identified as a key factor to understanding the decision process for prescriptions. The evidence shows that prediction of intended prescription behaviour increases significantly when behavioural control is added to the measurements of attitude and subjective norm. In circumstances of high behavioural control, the theory of planned behaviour seems to collapse in favour of the theory of reasoned action. © 2000, SAGE Publications.

The framework is applied to ticket sales for a university theater company, where it predicts ticket sales well in both an estimation and holdout sample.

Simon School of Business Administration, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, United States","Most supermarket firms choose to position themselves by offering either everyday low prices (EDLP) across several items or offering temporary price reductions (promotions) on a limited range of items. While this choice has been addressed from a theoretical perspective in both the marketing and economic literature, relatively little is known about how these decisions are made in practice, especially within a competitive environment. This paper exploits a unique store level data set consisting of every supermarket operating in the United States in 1998. For each of these stores, we observe the pricing strategy the firm has chosen to follow, as reported by the firm itself. Using a system of simultaneous discrete choice models, we estimate each store's choice of pricing strategy as a static discrete game of incomplete information. In contrast to the predictions of the theoretical literature, we find strong evidence that firms cluster by strategy by choosing actions that agree with those of its rivals. We also find a significant impact of various demographic and store/chain characteristics, providing some qualified support for several specific predictions from marketing theory. © 2008 INFORMS.","Discrete games; EDLP; Positioning strategies; Promotional pricing; Supermarkets","","","","","","","","Aguirregabiria V., Mira P., Sequential estimation of dynamic discrete games, Econometrica, 75, 1, pp. 1-53, (2007); Ashenfelter O., Ashmore D., Baker J.B., Gleason S., Hosken D.S., Econometric methods in merger analysis: Econometric analysis of pricing in FTC v. staples, Internat.

This study’s objective was to evaluate the influence of cultural aspects in the buying decision, going beyond the TRM, and proposing the Consumer Cultural Influence Model (CCIM), which analyses the consumer choice based not only on values, but also on the social axioms construct, as proposed by Leung et al. (2002). To test the CCIM, the Brazilian higher education market was chose as study object. Participated in the study 2,483 students from the entire country, with an average age of 22.6 years old (SD = 6.9) and 59.2% of them female. They completed an importance of tangible attributes measure, the Schwartz Values Scale (SCHWARTZ, 1994), the Social Axioms Scale, the Services Meaning and Judgment Scale, and demographics questions. After checking whether the assumptions were met, and Factor Analyses procedures, binary logistic regressions, among direct and sequential, were accomplished using only values, only axioms, and finally, values and axioms as criteria variables. In general, results show the stability of the CCIM, its superiority towards the TRM, with an increase in prediction of up to 89.5%. Whilst values are transituational and prescriptive, axioms are descriptive, accomplishing instrumental functions of attitudes related to objects description. Cognitively, the description of a social object is more available to the person than its prediction, due to the proximity of the attributes to the object, allowing a better explanation of the consumer behavior. Results have implications to a more effective marketing positioning, as the survival in the market also depends on subjective aspects, such as those included in the CCIM. © 2012 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

At present, they do so without much knowledge of the conceptual meaning or empirical properties of PE. In the spirit of construct explication, we report a study intended to address a series of questions about PE. Using student (N = 155) and community samples (N = 100), we found the following: (a) PE is a two-dimensional judgment involving global evaluations of message impact and specific judgments of message attributes, but it may be reducible to a single second-order factor, (b) most individuals reported using more than one referent (i.e., person or group) when making PE judgments, but the choice of referents varies by message and judge, and (c) judgments of PE are biased upward as a function of the number of referents chosen. Suggestions are offered for enhancing the validity of PE judgments in formative campaign research.

Performance measures are simple quantities that indicate the state of manufacturing organisations and are used as the basis of decision-making at this crucial early stage of the process. Fuzzy set theory is a method for using qualitative data and subjective opinion. Fuzzy sets have been used extensively in manufacturing for applications including control, decision-making, and estimation. Type-2 fuzzy sets are a novel extension of type-1 fuzzy sets. Aims to examine this subject. Design/methodology/approach - This research explores the increased use of type-2 fuzzy sets in manufacturing. In particular, type-2 fuzzy sets are used to model ""the words that mean different things to different people"". Findings - A model that can leverage design process knowledge and predict time to market from performance measures is a potentially valuable tool for decision making and continuous improvement. A number of data sources, such as process maps, from previous research into time to market in a high technology products company, are used to structure and build a type-2 fuzzy logic model for the prediction of time to market. Originality/value - This paper presents a demonstration of how the type-2 fuzzy logic model works and provides directions for further research into the design process for time to market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fuzzy logic; Time to market","Decision making; Forecasting; Formal logic; Fuzzy sets; Process control; Product development; Time series analysis; Process maps; Qualitative data; Time to market; Type-2 fuzzy sets; Marketing","","","","","","","Bicheno J., The Lean Toolbox, (2000); Doctor F., Hagras H., Callaghan V., A type-2 fuzzy embedded agent to realise ambient intelligence in ubiquitous computing environments, Information Sciences, 171, 4, pp. 309-334, (2005); Huarng K., Yu H.-K., A type-2 fuzzy time series model for stock index forecasting, Physica A, 353, pp. 445-462, (2005); Jahan-Shahi H., Shayan E., Masood S.H., Multi-valued fuzzy sets in cost/time estimation of flat plate processing, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 17, 10, pp. 751-759, (2001); Karnik N.N., Mendel J.M., Operations on type-2 fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 122, 2, pp. 327-348, (2001); Koliza V., Pearce D., Khoudian P., Page T., Formulation of a calculation for identifying actual and potential costs caused by delays in the new product introduction process, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Manufacturing Research, University of Strathclyde, pp. 229-233, (2003); Kratschmer V., Limit theorems for fuzzy random variables, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 126, 2, pp. 253-263, (2002); Maskell B., Baggaley B., Practical Lean Accounting, (2004); Mendel J.M., Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems, (2001); Mendel J., John R.I., Type-2 fuzzy sets made simple, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 10, 2, pp. 117-127, (2002); Nojiri H., A model of the executive's decision processes in new product development, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 7, pp. 227-241, (1982); Park K.S., Kim S.H., A note on the fuzzy weighted average rule, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 77, 3, pp. 315-320, (1996); Turksen I.B., Type-2 representation and meaning for CWW, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 127, 1, pp. 17-36, (2002); Walker C.L., Walker E.A., The algebra of fuzzy truth values, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 149, 2, pp. 309-347, (2005); Yager R.R., Noble reinforcement in disjunctive aggregation operators, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 11, 6, pp. 754-767, (2003)","P.

Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers' responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity - a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making. In this research, a case study is used as an example to demonstrate how marketing managers can use the information from a choice-based conjoint derived choice model differently depending on the manner in which the model validation is carried out. © 2009 The Market Research Society.","","","","","","","","","Adamowicz W., Habit formation and variety seeking in a discrete choice model of recreation demand, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 19, 1, pp. 19-31, (1994); Allenby G., Fennell G., Huber J., Adjusting choice models to better predict market behavior, Marketing Letters, 16, 3-4, pp. 197-208, (2005); Armstrong J.S., Shapiro A., Analyzing quantitative models, Journal of Marketing, 38, 2, pp. 61-66, (1974); Backhaus K., Hillig T., Wilken R., Predicting purchase decisions with different conjoint analysis methods: A Monte Carlo simulation, International Journal of Market Research, 49, 3, pp. 341-364, (2007); Bemmaor A.C., Franses P.H., The diffusion of market science in the practitioners' community: Opening the black box, Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry, 21, 4-5, pp. 289-301, (2005); Ben-Akiva M.E., Morikawa T., Estimation of switching models from revealed preferences and stated intentions, Transportation Research, 24, 6, pp. 485-495, (1990); Bradlow E., Current issues and a 'wish list' for conjoint analysis, Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry, 21, 4-5, pp. 319-323, (2005); Campo K., Gijsbrechts E., Guerra F., Computer simulated shopping experiments for analyzing dynamic purchasing patterns: Validation and guidelines, Journal of Empirical Generalizations in Marketing Science, 4, pp. 22-61, (1999); Cook T., Campbell D., Design and Analysis of Quasi-Experimental Design for Research, (1979); Elrod T., Recommendations for validation of choice models, Proceedings of the Sawtooth Software Conference, pp. 225-243, (2001); Green P.E., Krieger A., Wind Y., Thirty years of conjoint analysis: Reflections and prospects, Interfaces, 31, SUPPL.EMENT 3, pp. 56-73, (2001); Hensher D.A., Bradley M., Using stated response choice data to enrich revealed preference discrete choice models, Marketing Letters, 4, 2, pp. 139-151, (1993); Huber J.C., Wittink D.R., Fiedler J.A., Miller R.L., The effectiveness of alternative preference elicitation procedures in predicting choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 30, 1, pp. 105-114, (1993); Juster F., Consumer buying intentions and purchase probability: An experiment in survey design, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 61, 315, pp. 658-696, (1966); Laurent G., Improving the external validity of market models: A plea for more qualitative input, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 17, 2-3, pp. 177-182, (2000); Liefeld J., Consumer research in the land of Oz, Marketing Research, 15, 1, pp. 10-15, (2003); Little J., Models and managers: The concept of a decision calculus, Management Science, 16, 8, pp. 466-485, (1970); Louviere J., Conjoint analysis modelling of stated preferences.

Predictive tests demonstrate that the proposed model, using an ""inferred"" measure of influence, leads to more accurate predictions than alternative measures.","","","","","","","","","Ainslie A., Rossi P.E., Similarities in choice behavior across product categories, Marketing Science, 17, 2, pp. 91-106, (1998); Allenby G.M., Arora N., Ginter J.L., Incorporating prior knowledge into the analysis of conjoint studies, Journal of Marketing Research, 32, MAY, pp. 152-162, (1995); On the heterogeneity of demand, Journal of Marketing Research, 35, AUGUST, pp. 384-389, (1998); Ginter J.L., Using extremes to design products and segment markets, Journal of Marketing Research, 32, NOVEMBER, pp. 392-403, (1995); Arora N., Allenby G.M., Ginter J.L., A hierarchical bayes model of primary and secondary demand, Marketing Science, 17, 1, pp. 29-44, (1998); Burns A.C., Granbois D.H., Factors moderating the resolution of preference conflict in family automobile purchasing, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, FEBRUARY, pp. 77-86, (1977); Chintagunta P., Investigating purchase incidence, brand choice and purchase quantity decisions of households, Marketing Science, 12, 2, pp. 184-208, (1993); Corfman K.P., Measures of Relative Influence in Couples: A Typology and Predictions for Accuracy in Advances in Consumer Research, 16, pp. 659-664, (1989); Perceptions of relative influence: Formation and measurement, Journal of Marketing Research, 28, MAY, pp. 125-136, (1991); Harlam B.A., Relative Influence of Parent and Child in Joint Purchase Decisions: The Role of Product Characteristics, (1998); Lehmann D.R., Models of cooperative decision-making and relative influence, Journal of Consumer Research, 14, JUNE, pp. 1-13, (1987); The importance of others' welfare in evaluating bargaining outcomes, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, JUNE, pp. 124-137, (1993); Curry D.J., Mensaco M.B., Van Ark J.W., Multiattribute dyadic choice: Models and tests, Journal of Marketing Research, 28, AUGUST, pp. 259-267, (1991); Davis H.L., Decision making within the household, Journal of Consumer Research, 2, MARCH, pp. 241-260, (1976); Dellaert B.G.C., Prodigalidad M., Louviere J.J., Family members' projections of each other's preference and influence: A two-stage conjoint approach, Marketing Letters, 9, 2, pp. 135-145, (1998); Gelfand A.E., Smith A.F.M., Sampling-based approaches to calculating marginal densities, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 87, JUNE, pp. 523-532, (1990); Heckman J.J., Singer B., A method of minimizing the impact of distributional assumptions in econometric models for duration data, Econometrica, 52, 2, pp. 271-320, (1984); Jain D.C., Vilcassim N.J., Investigating household purchase timing decisions: A conditional hazard function approach, Marketing Science, 10, WINTER, pp. 1-23, (1991); Krishnamurthi L., Conjoint models of family decision making, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 5, 3, pp. 185-198, (1988); Lenk P.J., DeSarbo W.S., Green P.E., Young M.R., Hierarchical bayes conjoint analysis: Recovery of partworth heterogeneity from reduced experimental designs, Marketing Science, 15, 2, pp. 173-191, (1996); Madrigal R., Miller C.M., Construct validity of spouses' relative influence measures: An application of the direct product model, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 24, 2, pp. 157-170, (1996); Mensaco M.B., Curry D.J., Utility and choice: An empirical study of wife/husband decision making, Journal of Consumer Research, 16, JUNE, pp. 87-97, (1989); Myers D.G., Lamm H., The group polarization phenomenon, Psychological Bulletin, 83, JULY, pp. 602-627, (1976); Rao V.R., Steckel J.H., A polarization model for describing group preferences, Journal of Consumer Research, 18, JUNE, pp. 108-118, (1991); Rossi P.E., McCulloch R.E., Allenby G.M., The value of purchase history data in target marketing, Marketing Science, 15, 4, pp. 321-340, (1996); Silk A.J., Kalwani M.U., Measuring influence in organizational purchase decisions, Journal of Marketing Research, 19, MAY, pp. 165-181, (1982); Steckel J.H., Lehmann D.R., Corfman K.P., Estimating probabilistic choice models from sparse data: A method and an application to groups, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 1, pp. 131-139, (1988); O'Shaughnessy J., Towards a new way to measure power: Applying conjoint analysis to group decisions, Marketing Letters, 1, 1, pp. 37-46, (1989); Turk J.L., Bell N.W., Measuring power in families, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 34, MAY, pp. 215-222, (1972)","N.

Based on regulatory focus theory, we propose that competitive success prompts an increased sense of responsibility in managers, causing them to assume a defensive attitude and to concentrate on preserving the status quo instead of becoming complacent. Data collected from the Markstrat simulation support our predictions. The findings imply that efforts to encourage strategic change by pressurizing managers will backfire, because they will aggravate managers' defensive attitude. Instead, firms should loosen the pressure on managers and allow them to experiment with innovative strategies. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","decision making; marketing strategy; Markstrat; regulatory focus; strategic inertia","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., Lee A.Y., Understanding regulatory fit, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, pp. 15-19, (2006); Atwater L., Brett J., Feedback format: Does it influence manager's reactions to feedback?, Journal of Occupational & Organizational Psychology, 79, pp. 517-532, (2006); Audia P.G., Locke E.A., Smith K.G., The paradox of success: An archival and a laboratory study of strategic persistence following radical environmental change, Academy of Management Journal, 43, pp. 837-853, (2000); Avnet T., Higgins E.T., How regulatory fit affects value in consumer choices and opinions, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, pp. 1-10, (2006); Babb E.M., Leslie M.A., van Slyke M.D., The potential of business gaming methods in research, Journal of Business, 39, pp. 465-472, (1966); Bergkvist L., Rossiter J.R., The predictive validity of multiple-item versus single-item measures of the same constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, pp. 175-184, (2007); Bergkvist L., Rossiter J.R., Tailor-made single-item measures of doubly concrete constructs, International Journal of Advertising, 28, pp. 607-621, (2009); Boeker W., Strategic change: The influence of managerial characteristics and organizational growth, Academy of Management Journal, 40, pp. 152-170, (1997); Brockner J., Higgins E.T., Low M.B., Regulatory focus theory and the entrepreneurial process, Journal of Business Venturing, 19, pp. 203-220, (2004); Bryant P., Dunford R., The influence of regulatory focus on risky decision-making, Applied Psychology: An International Review, 57, pp. 335-359, (2008); Chandy R.K., Tellis G.J., The incumbent's curse?

By drawing on the notion of the prediction- decision inconsistency, we posit satisfaction as a consumption/experience utility and loyalty as a decision utility to explain the missing link between satisfaction and loyalty. An important assumption that may be driving the prediction-decision inconsistency, but has not been addressed, is the different criteria that consumers use in arriving at the two different types of utilities. The authors argue that this difference affects the compatibility, and resulting influence, of quality versus price information on satisfaction and loyalty evaluations. An empirical study of 183 firms using data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index is reported which supports the proposed compatibility effects.

A secondary goal is to investigate how managers perceive the need to retain control over three core functional areas (marketing, production, and R&D) when making entry-mode decisions. Design/methodology/approach - A field experiment design was implemented in a sample of US business owner/executives. Using an online data collection method, the study asked a sample of small-business owners and managers to assess the amount of risk they associated with three modes of entering the Japanese market: non-ownership (export), equal partnership (50/50 joint-venture), and sole-ownership. They were also asked how much control they needed to retain over R&D, production, and marketing for the venture to be successful. Findings - Ownership-provided control interacts with capability to influence managerial risk perceptions. Managers in lower-capability firms see the least risk in the non-ownership entry mode while those in higher-capability firms see the least risk in the equal-partnership entry mode. Managers believe that for a new venture in a foreign market to be successful, control should be retained over the R&D function, regardless of entry mode. Research limitations/implications - The findings appear to reconcile some of the conflicting predictions of the transaction cost and resource-based theoretical perspectives, because it appears that international managers consider both control (internationalization theory) and capability (resource-based theory) when judging the perceived risk of an entry strategy. Practical implications - For firms that are incapable of managing in an international context, a low-control no-ownership entry mode is perceived as the least risky approach; for firms that have some capability for international management, then a partial-ownership mode such as a 50/50 joint-venture is perceived as having lower risk than no-ownership. In non-ownership and joint-venture type entry modes, managers are more apt to outsource the marketing function to an agent/partner, but not R&D. In contrast, managers believe that marketing needs to be maintained in-house when utilizing a sole-ownership entry mode. Originality/value - By illustrating the role of perceived risk in foreign-market entry-mode decisions and demonstrating how capabilities interact with ownership-provided control to moderate these perceptions, the paper's findings suggest that managers' risk perceptions may mediate the effects of firm-specific factors, and thus contributes significantly to both theory and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Japan;

Addressing theoreticians and practitioners alike, this paper uses multiple empirical methods to show that consumers voluntarily and strategically ration their purchase quantities of goods that are likely to be consumed on impulse and that therefore may pose self-control problems. For example, many regular smokers buy their cigarettes by the pack, although they could easily afford to buy 10-pack cartons. These smokers knowingly forgo sizable per-unit savings from quantity discounts, which they could realize if they bought cartons; by rationing their purchase quantities, they also self-impose additional transactions costs on marginal consumption, which makes excessive smoking overly difficult and costly. Such strategic self-imposition of constraints is intuitively appealing yet theoretically problematic. The marketing literature lacks operationalizations and empirical tests of such consumption self-control strategies and of their managerial implications. This paper provides experimental evidence of the operation of consumer self-control and empirically illustrates its direct implications for the pricing of consumer goods. Moreover, the paper develops a conceptual frame-work for the design of empirical tests of such self-imposed constraints on consumption in consumer goods markets. Within matched pairs of products, we distinguish relative ""virtue"" and ""vice"" goods whose preference ordering changes with whether consumers evaluate immediate or delayed consumption consequences. For example, ignoring long-term health effects, many smokers prefer regular (relative vice) to light (relative virtue) cigarettes, because they prefer the taste of the former. However, ignoring these short-term taste differences, the same smokers prefer light to regular cigarettes when they consider the long-term health effects of smoking. These preference orders can lead to dynamically inconsistent consumption choices by consumers whose tradeoffs between the immediate and delayed consequences of consumption depend on the time lag between purchase and consumption. This creates a potential self-control problem, because these consumers will be tempted to overconsume the vices they have in stock at home. Purchase quantity rationing helps them solve the self-control Problem by limiting their stock and hence their consumption opportunities. Such rationing implies that, per purchase occasion, vice consumers will be less likely than virtue consumers to buy larger quantities in response to unit price reductions such as quantity discounts. We first test this prediction in two laboratory experiments. We then examine the external validity of the results at the retail level with a field survey of quantity discounts and with a scanner data analysis of chain-wide store-level demand across a variety of different pairs of matched vice (regular) and virtue (reduced fat, calorie, or caffeine, etc.) product categories. The analyses of these experimental, field, and scanner data provide strong convergent evidence of a characteristic crossover in demand schedules for relative vices and virtues for categories as diverse as, among others, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, cream cheese, beer, soft drinks, ice cream and frozen yogurt, chewing gum, coffee, and beef and turkey bologna. Vice consumers' demand increases less in response to price reductions than virtue consumers' demand, although their preferences are not generally weaker for vices than for virtues. Constraints on vice purchases are self-imposed and strategic rather than driven by simple preferences. We suggest that rationing their vice inventories at the point of purchase allows consumers to limit subsequent consumption. As a result of purchase quantity rationing, however, vice buyers forgo savings from price reductions through quantity discounts, effectively paying price premiums for the opportunity to engage in self-control. Thus, purchase quantity rationing vice consumers are relatively price insensitive. From a managerial and public policy perspective, our findings should offer marketing practitioners in many consumer goods industries new opportunities to increase profits through segmentation and price discrimination based on consumer self-control. They can charge premium prices for small sizes of vices, relative to the corresponding quantity discounts for virtues. Virtue consumers, on the other hand, will buy larger amounts even when quantity discounts are relatively shallow. A key conceptual contribution of this paper lies in showing how marketing researchers can investigate a whole class of strategic self-constraining consumer behaviors empirically. Moreover, this research is the first to extend previous, theoretical work on impulse control by empirically demonstrating its broader implications for marketing decision making.","Intertemporal choice; Pricing policy; Product policy; Segmentation; Self-control","","","","","","","","Ainslie G., Specious reward: A behavioral theory of impulsiveness and impulse control, Psychological Bulletin, 82, pp. 463-496, (1975); Benzion U., Rapoport A., Yagil J., Discount rates inferred from decisions: An experimental study, Management Sci., 35, MARCH, pp. 270-284, (1989); Boulding W., Lee E., Staelin R., Mastering the mix: Do advertising, promotion, and sales force activities lead to differentiation?, J.

The model examines independently and as a package the effects of five types of tobacco control policies: tax increases, clean air laws, mass media campaigns, advertising bans, and youth access policies. Predictions suggest that the largest reductions in smoking rates will result from implementing a comprehensive tobacco control policy package. Significant inroads may be achieved through tax increases. A media campaign along with programs to publicize and enforce clean air laws, advertising bans and youth access laws would further reduce smoking rates. Tobacco control policies have the potential to make large dents in smoking rates, which in turn could lead to many lives saved. In the absence of these measures, deaths from smoking will increase. The model also helps to identify information gaps pertinent both to modeling and policymaking. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States; Gupta S., Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14853, United States","In many categories consumers display cyclical buying: they repeatedly purchase in the category for several periods, followed by several periods of not buying. We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of crosscategory substitution by the consumer, caused by ""variety-seeking"" tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high versus low purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3% households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions-customized timing of price reductions. © 2011 INFORMS.","Brand choice; Endogeneity; Heterogeneity; Logit model; Random coefficients; Scanner data; Simulated maximum likelihood","","","","","","","","Ailawadi K.L., Neslin S.A., The effect of promotion on consumption: Buying more and consuming it faster, J.

As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices. © 2006 INFORMS.","Bankruptcy; Econometrics; Electronic commerce; Fulfillment; Hazard model; Internet; Retailing; Supply chain management","Benchmarking; Database systems; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Internet; Outsourcing; Strategic planning; Bankruptcy; Econometrics; Fulfillment; Supply chain management; Investments","","","","","","","Allison P., Survival Analysis Using the SAS System: A Practical Guide, (1995); Allison P., Logistic Regression Using the SAS System: Theory and Application, (1999); Altman E., Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy: A Complete Guide to Predicting and Avoiding Distress and Profiting from Bankruptcy, (1993); Anderson E., Schmittlein D.C., Integration of the sales force: An empirical investigation, RAND J.

In particular, we investigated the beneficial effect of adding the voice of customers through call center emails - i.e. textual information - to a churn-prediction system that only uses traditional marketing information. We found that adding unstructured, textual information into a conventional churn-prediction model resulted in a significant increase in predictive performance. From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to better identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, they examine consumer activities that can exacerbate or limit these effects. The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46%, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93%. The results support the predictions that list use, more frequent trips, limiting the aisles visited, limiting time spent in the store, and paying by cash are effective strategies for decreasing the likelihood of making unplanned purchases. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","First moment of truth;

Wisconsin-Madison, 5148 V., Madison, WI 53706, United States","Previous research on charitable giving has devoted little attention to the fundamental question of how consumers actually respond to charitable donation requests via direct mail. Specifically, researchers have relied on the untested assumption that consumers engage in fairly extensive evaluations of requests. The present research challenges this assumption. By means of a simple scenario-technique, cognitive and behavioural responses to donation requests were first elicited from a sample of 90 consumers. A qualitative constant comparative analysis of responses resulted in the discovery of three different donor categories with different styles of decision-making: analysts (ANA), relationists (REL) and internalists (INT). ANA were characterised by high involvement and thorough evaluations of both the organisation behind a request and the specific cause promoted. REL were loyal to specific organisations and seldom attended to other information than the organisation behind the request. Interestingly, consumers in the final category, INT, neither evaluated the organisation nor the cause promoted. For these consumers, recognition of the requesting organisation was usually enough to trigger a positive response. In a follow-up survey including responses from more than 400 consumers, the typology of response styles was further explored and validated. In line with predictions from study 1, significant differences were observed in the ways ANA, REL and INT perceive, evaluate and give money to charitable organisations. The findings offer important implications for consumer psychology, public policy and charity marketing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","3920; 3940; Charity marketing; Decision making; Fund raising; L3; M3; Non-profit organisations","","","","","","","","Bagozzi R.P., Moore D.J., Public service advertisements: Emotions and empathy guide prosocial behavior, Journal of Marketing, 58, pp. 56-70, (1994); Battacharya C.B., Rao H., Glynn M.A., Understanding the bond of identification: An investigation of its correlates among art museum members, Journal of Marketing, 59, pp. 46-57, (1995); Bendapudi N., Singh S.N., Bendapudi V., Enhancing helping-behavior: An integrative framework for promotion planning, Journal of Marketing, 60, 3, pp. 33-49, (1986); Berkowitz L., Social norms, feelings and other factors affecting helping and altruism, Advances in Experimental Psychology, (1972); Braus P., Will boomers give generously?, American Demographics, 16, 7, (1994); Briggs C.L., Learning How to Ask: Sociolinguistic Appraisal of the Role of the Interview in Social Science Research, (1986); Brockner J., Guzzi B., Kane J., Levine E., Shaplen K., Organizational fundraising: Further evidence on the effect of legitimizing small donations, Journal of Consumer Research, 11, pp. 611-614, (1984); Brucks M., The effects of product class knowledge on information search behavior, Journal of Consumer Research, 12, (1985); Brunel F.F., Nelson M.R., Explaining gendered responses to 'help-self' and 'help-others' charity ad appeals: The mediating role of world-views, Journal of Advertising, 29, 3, pp. 15-27, (2000); Burnett J., Morarity S., Introduction to Marketing Communications: An Integrated Approach, (1998); Cermak D.S.P., File K.M., Prince R.A., A benefit segmentation of the major donor market, Journal of Business Research, 29, pp. 121-130, (1994); Darby M.R., Karni E., Free competition and the optimal amount of fraud, The Journal of Law and Economics, 16, (1974); Eisenberg N., Altruistic Emotion, Cognition, and Behaviour, (1986); Eisenberger R., Huntington R., Hutchinson S., Sowa D., Perceived organizational support, Journal of Applied Psychology, 71, pp. 500-507, (1986); Fisher J.L., The growth of heartlessness: The need for studies on philanthropy, Educational Record, 67, 1, pp. 25-28, (1986); Fontana A., Frey J.H., Interviewing: The art of science, Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 361-376, (1994); Fraser C., Hite R.E., Sauer P.L., Increasing contributions in solicitation campaigns: The use of large and small anchorpoints, Journal of Consumer Research, 15, pp. 284-287, (1988); German S.T., Nonprofit Relationship Marketing: The Role of Identification, (1997); Griffin M., Babin B.J., Attaway J.S., Darden W.R., Hey you, can ya spare some change?

Even in the early days, some data mining approaches relied on traditional OR methods such as linear programming and forecasting, and modern data mining methods are based on a wide variety of OR methods including linear and quadratic optimization, genetic algorithms and concepts based on artificial ant colonies. The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance. In this paper, we outline a series of upcoming trends and challenges for data mining and its role within OR. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

The current study, in contrast, examined how predecision mental simulations (prefactuals) and feelings of anticipated regret are affected by different marketing strategies. A preliminary investigation found that consumers frequently produce upward prefactuals (e.g., if I buy it today and find it for less next week, I'll regret my purchase) when considering a major purchase. It was hypothesized that providing price guarantees would reduce upward prefactual generation and reduce anticipated regret. The primary investigation supported these predictions. When price guarantees were available, prefactuals were more downward in direction and negative affect was reduced. Also, price guarantees increased long-term satisfaction and happiness even when they were not exercised. Implications for mental simulation, marketing, and judgment and decision making are discussed. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Bell D.E., Regret in decision making under uncertainty, Operations Research, 30, pp. 961-981, (1982); Bell D.E., Disappointment in decision making under uncertainty, Operations Research, 33, pp. 1-27, (1985); Brehm S.S., Brehm J.W., Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control, (1981); Davis C.G., Lehman D.R., Wortman C.B., Silver R.C., Thompson S.C., The undoing of traumatic life events, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 109-124, (1995); Eagly A.H., Wood W., Chaiken S., Causal inferences about communicators and their effect on opinion change, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36, pp. 424-435, (1978); Fishburn P., Nontransitive measurable utility, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 26, pp. 31-67, (1983); Gleicher F., Boninger D.S., Strathman A., Armor D., Hetts J., Ahn M., With an eye toward the future: The impact of counterfactual thinking on affect, attitudes, and behavior, What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking, pp. 283-304, (1995); Kahneman D., Miller D.T., Norm theory: Comparing reality to its alternatives, Psychological Review, 93, pp. 136-153, (1986); Kahneman D., Tversky A., Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk, Econometrica, 47, pp. 263-291, (1979); Kahneman D., Tversky A., The simulation heuristic, Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, pp. 201-208, (1982); Loomes G., Further evidence of the impact of regret and disappointment on choice under uncertainty, Economica, 55, pp. 47-62, (1988); Loomes G., Sugden R., Regret theory: An alternative theory of rational choice under uncertainty, Economic Journal, 92, pp. 805-824, (1982); Markman K.D., Gavanski I., Sherman S.J., McMullen M.N., The mental simulation of better and worse possible worlds, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 29, pp. 87-109, (1993); Markman K.D., Gavanski I., Sherman S.J., McMullen M.N., The impact of perceived control on the imagination of better and worse possible worlds, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 588-595, (1995); Medvec V.H., Madey S.F., Gilovich T., When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic medalists, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69, pp. 603-610, (1995); Medvec V.H., Savitsky K., When doing better means feeling worse: A model of counterfactual cutoff points, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 1284-1296, (1997); Miller D.T., Taylor B.R., Counterfactual thought, regret, and superstition: How to avoid kicking yourself, What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking, pp. 305-331, (1995); Plous S., The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making, (1993); Ritov I., Probability of regret: Anticipation of uncertainty resolution in choice, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 66, pp. 228-236, (1996); Ritov I., Baron J., Outcome knowledge, regret, and omission bias, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 64, pp. 119-127, (1995); Roese N.J., The functional basis of counterfactual thinking, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66, pp. 805-818, (1994); Roese N.J., Counterfactual thinking, Psychological Bulletin, 121, pp. 133-148, (1997); Roese N.J., Olson J.M., Outcome controllability and counterfactual thinking, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 620-628, (1995); Roese N.J., Olson J.M., Counterfactual thinking: The intersection of affect and function, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 29, pp. 1-59, (1997); Sherman S.J., McConnell A.R., Dysfunctional implications of counterfactual thinking: When alternatives to reality fail us, What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking, pp. 199-231, (1995); Sherman S.J., McConnell A.R., The role of counterfactual thinking in reasoning, Applied Cognitive Psychology, 10, (1996); Simonson I., The influence of anticipating regret and responsibility on purchase decisions, Journal of Consumer Research, 19, pp. 105-118, (1992); Spellman B.A., Crediting causality, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 126, pp. 323-348, (1997); Sugden R., Regret, recrimination and rationality, Theory and Decision, 19, pp. 77-99, (1985); Von Neumann J., Morgenstern O., Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, (1947); Zeelenberg M., Beattie J., Van Der Pligt J., De Vries N.K., Consequences of regret aversion: Effects of expected feedback on risky decision making, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 65, pp. 148-158, (1996); Zeelenberg M., Van Dijk W.W., Van Der Pligt J., Manstead A.S.R., Van Empelen P., Reinderman D., Emotional reactions to the outcomes of decisions: The role of counterfactual thought in the experience of regret and disappointment, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 75, pp. 117-141, (1998)","A.R.

We propose a split-hazard model that makes use of a time transformation (a concept we call virtual time) to allow for the estimation of straightforward parametric hazard functions and generate early predictions of an individual campaign's performance (as measured by open and click propensities). We apply this pretesting methodology to 25 e-mail campaigns and find that the method is able to produce in an hour and fifteen minutes estimates that are more accurate and more reliable than those that the traditional method (doubling time) produces after 14 hours. Other benefits of our method are that we make testing independent of the time of day and we produce meaningful confidence intervals. Thus, our methodology can be used not only for testing purposes, but also for live monitoring. The testing procedure is coupled with a formal decision theoretic framework to generate a sequential testing procedure useful for the real time evaluation of campaigns.© 2009 informs.","Advertising campaigns; Database marketing; E-mail; Pretesting","","","","","","","","Ainslie A., Dreze X., Zufryden F., Modeling movie life cycles and market share, Marketing Sci, 24, 3, pp. 508-517, (2005); Bitran G.D., Mondschein S.V., Mailing decisions in the catalog sales industry, Management Sci, 42, 9, pp. 1364-1381, (1996); Blair M.H., An empirical investigation of advertising wearin and wearout, J.

When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Analytical models; Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Pricing; Trade-ins","","","","","","","","Adda J., Cooper R., Balladurette and Juppette: A discrete analysis of scrapping subsidies, Journal of Political Economy, 108, 4, pp. 778-806, (2000); Ahluwalia R., How prevalent is the negativity effect in consumer environments?, Journal of Consumer Research, 29, pp. 270-279, (2002); Camerer C., Ho T., Violations of the betweenness axiom and nonlinearity in probability, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 8, 2, pp. 167-196, (1994); Chakravarti D., Krish R., Paul P., Srivastava J., Partitioned presentation of multicomponent bundle prices: Evaluation, choice and underlying processing effects, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 215-229, (2002); Cheema A., Soman D., The effect of partitions on controlling consumption, Journal of Marketing Research, 45, pp. 665-675, (2008); Chen H., Rao A.R., Close encounters of two kinds: False alarms and dashed hopes, Marketing Science, 21, 2, pp. 160-177, (2002); Chernev A., Goal orientation and consumer preference for the status quo, Journal of Consumer Research, 31, pp. 557-565, (2004); Illinois Sues Car Dealers, (2003); Cosmides L., Tooby J., Are humans good intuitive statisticians after all?

The life-cycle hypothesis from economics argues that consumers should intertemporally reallocate their incomes over their life stream to maximize lifetime utility. One form of intertemporal allocation is to use past income (in the form of savings) in the future. A second form is the use of future income in the present. This can only be done if consumers have access to a temporary pool of money that they can draw from and replenish in the future - a function performed by consumer credit. However, our research reinforces prior findings that consumers are unable to correctly value their future incomes, and that they lack the cognitive capability to solve the intertemporal optimization problem required by the life-cycle hypothesis. Instead, we argue that consumers use information such as the credit limit as a signal of their future earnings potential. Specifically, if consumers have access to large amounts of credit, they are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be high and hence their willingness to use credit (and their spending) will also be high. Conversely, consumers who are granted lower amounts of credit are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be low and hence their spending will be lower. However, based on research in the area of consumer skepticism and inference making, we also argue for a moderating role of the credibility associated with the credit limit. Specifically, we argue that the above effect of credit availability would be particularly strong for consumers who believe that the credit limit credibly signals their future earnings potential (i.e., a naïve consumer who has limited experience with consumer credit). However, as consumers gain experience with credit, they start discounting credit availability as a predictor of their future and start questioning the validity of the process used to set the credit limit. Hence, with experience the effect of credit limit on the willingness to use credit should be attenuated. We test these predictions in five separate studies. In the first experimental study, we manipulate credit limit and credibility and pose subjects with a hypothetical purchase opportunity. Consistent with our prediction, credit limit impacted the propensity to spend, but only when the credibility was high. In the second experimental study, we replicate these findings even when subjects were given information about their expected future salaries, and also show that the credit limit influences their expectation of future earnings potential. In the third study, we show that the mere availability (and increase) of current liquidity cannot explain our findings. In the fourth study, we conduct a survey of consumers in which we measure a number of demographic characteristics and also ask them for their propensity to spend in a given purchase situation. In the fifth study we use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset, a triennial survey of U.S. families that is designed to provide detailed information on the use of financial services, spending behaviors, and selected demographic characteristics. Results from both studies 4 and 5 provide further support for our proposed framework-credit limits influence spending to a greater extent for consumers with lower credibility: younger consumers and less-educated consumers. Across all studies we achieved triangulation by using a variety of approaches (surveys and experiments), subjects types (young students and older consumers), nature of predictor variables (manipulated and measured), dependent measures (purchase likelihood, credit card balance, new charges), and methods of analysis (ANOVA and regression), and consistently found that increasing credit limits on a credit card increases spending, especially when the credibility of the limit is high. This paper joins a growing body of literature in marketing and behavioral decision theory that goes beyond the traditional domains of inquiry (e.g., product choice, effects of marketing mix variables) and focuses on consumer decisions relating to the appropriate use of income to finance consumption. Our framework differs from prior research on the effect of payment mechanisms on spending in two significant ways. First, we are interested in the effects of the availability of credit on spending, and not necessarily in the effect of the transaction format that is associated with each payment mechanism. Second, while prior research has studied the point-of-purchase and historic (i.e., prepurchase) effects of credit, the present research is concerned with the availability of credit in the future. Specifically, our framework is invariant to the current and prior usage of credit by the consumer.","","","","","","","","","Ainslie G., Haslam N., Self-control, Choice over Time, pp. 177-209, (1992); Andelman D.A., Till debt us do part, Management Rea, 87, 1, pp. 55-57, (1998); Ando A., Modigliani F., The life cycle model: Aggregate implications and tests, Amer.

Managers expect these forecasts to be ""realistic"" in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or ""base-case"" scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base-case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base-case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because defining the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base-case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment. © 2008 INFORMS.","Bayesian decision theory; Conjoint analysis; Constrained optimization; Cross-validation; Hierarchical bayes; Loss function; Market share prediction; Penalized maximum likelihood; Posterior risk","","","","","","","","Aitchison J., Silvey S.D., Maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters subject to restraints, Ann.

In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ""forward-looking"" model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent. We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run. The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ""structural"" estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ""structural"" models. A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change. Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.","Advertising; Brand choice; Buyer Behavior; Choice Models; Econometric Modelling; Information Processing","","","","","","","","Amemiya T., Advanced Econometrics, (1985); Bawa K., Modeling inertia and variety-seeking tendencies in brand choice behavior, Marketing Science, 3, pp. 263-278, (1991); Bellman R., Dynamic Programming, (1957); Carpenter G.S., Lehmann D.R., A model of marketing mix, brand switching and competition, Journal of Marketing Research, 22, pp. 318-329, (1985); DeGroot M.H., Optimal Statistical Decisions, (1970); Eckstein Z., Horsky D., Raban Y., An Empirical Dynamic Model of Brand Choice, 88, (1988); Elrod T., Choice map: Inferring a product market map from observed choice behavior, Marketing Science, 7, pp. 21-40, (1988); Keane M.P., A factor-analytic model for representing the market structure in panel data, Journal of Marketing Research, 32, pp. 1-16, (1995); Winer R.S., An Empirical Comparison of Mapping Methods Based on Panel Data, (1991); Erdem T., Dynamic Brand Choice and Product Market Signalling under Imperfect Information, (1993); Fishbein M., Attitude and the prediction of behavior, Readings in Attitude Theory and Measurement, (1967); Guadagni P.M., Little J.D.C., A logit model of brand choice calibrated on scanner data, Marketing Science, 2, pp. 203-238, (1983); Hanneman M., Discrete/continuous models of consumer demand, Econometrica, 52, pp. 541-561, (1984); Heckman J.B., Heterogeneity and state dependence, Studies in Labor Markets, pp. 91-139, (1981); Hoffman P.J., The paramorphic representation of clinical judgement, Psychological Bulletin, 47, pp. 116-131, (1960); Howard J.A., Sheth J.N., The Theory of Buyer Behavior, (1969); Jeuland A.P., Brand preferences over time: A partially deterministic operationalization of the notion of variety-seeking, AMA Research Frontiers in Marketing: Dialogues and Directions, 43, pp. 33-37, (1978); Kahn B.E., Kalwani M.U., Morrison D.G., Measuring variety-seeking and reinforcement behaviors using panel data, Journal of Marketing Research, 23, pp. 89-100, (1986); Keane M.P., Simulation estimation for panel data models with limited dependent variables, Handbook of Statistics, (1993); A computationally practical simulation estimator for panel data, Econometrica, 62, 1, pp. 95-116, (1994); Wolpin K.I., Solution and estimation of dynamic programming models by simulation, Review of Economics and Statistics, 76, 4, pp. 648-672, (1994); Lancaster K., A new approach to consumer theory, Journal of Political Economy, 74, pp. 132-157, (1966); Lerman S., Manski C., On the use of simulated frequencies to approximate choice probabilities, Structural Analysis of Discrete Data with Econometric Applications, (1987); Lucas R.E.

Online referral marketing, for example, is a business practice that rewards customers who successfully refer other customers to a website or upon completion of a sale usually via their own social contacts. The referral rewards come in different forms such as shopping vouchers, redeemable points, discounts, prizes, cash payments, etc. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the business potential of incorporating an online referral marketing program into the firm's product selling strategies. Under different demand dynamics, we investigate the optimal decision making including the pricing and referral strategies to maximize the seller's profitability. We find that, under simple decision making environment such as fixed product price and myopic strategy, different demand dynamics yield the same prediction of the referral payment, which turns out to be a static policy. However, under complex market situations, both the optimal product pricing and referral offering critically depend on the demand side dynamics. Under the nonlinear demand dynamics, the referral payment is an all-or-nothing decision throughout the product selling horizon. In contrast, under the linear demand assumption, the referral payment can be partially offered in initial phase of the product introduction. We further offer some managerial insights to guide practical implementation of the online referral marketing strategy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The motion picture industry poses some unique challenges. For example, the consumer adoption process for movies is very sensitive to word-of-mouth interactions, which are difficult to measure and predict before the movie has been released. In this article, we undertake the challenge to develop and implement MOVIEMOD - a prerelease market evaluation model for the motion picture industry. MOVIEMOD is designed to generate box-office forecasts and to support marketing decisions for a new movie after the movie has been produced (or when it is available in a rough cut) but before it has been released. Unlike other forecasting models for motion pictures, the calibration of MOVIEMOD does not require any actual sales data. Also, the data collection time for a product with a limited lifetime such as a movie should not take too long. For MOVIEMOD it takes only three hours in a ""consumer clinic"" to collect the data needed for the prediction of box-office sales and the evaluation of alternative marketing plans. The model is based on a behavioral representation of the consumer adoption process for movies as a macroflow process. The heart of MOVIEMOD is an interactive Markov chain model describing the macro-flow process. According to this model, at any point in time with respect to the movie under study, a consumer can be found in one of the following behavioral states: undecided, considerer, rejecter, positive spreader, negative spreader, and inactive. The progression of consumers through the behavioral states depends on a set of movie-specific factors that are related to the marketing mix, as well as on a set of more general behavioral factors that characterize the movie-going behavior in the population of interest. This interactive Markov chain model allows us to account for word-of-mouth interactions among potential adopters and several types of word-of-mouth spreaders in the population. Marketing variables that influence the transitions among the states are movie theme acceptability, promotion strategy, distribution strategy, and the movie experience. The model is calibrated in a consumer clinic experiment. Respondents fill out a questionnaire with general items related to their movie-going and movie communication behavior, they are exposed to different sets of information stimuli, they are actually shown the movie, and finally, they fill out postmovie evaluations, including word-of-mouth intentions. These measures are used to estimate the word-of-mouth parameters and other behavioral factors, as well as the movie-specific parameters of the model. MOVIEMOD produces forecasts of the awareness, adoption intention, and cumulative penetration for a new movie within the population of interest for a given base marketing plan. It also provides diagnostic information on the likely impact of alternative marketing plans on the commercial performance of a new movie. We describe two applications of MOVIEMOD: One is a pilot study conducted without studio cooperation in the United States, and the other is a full-fledged implementation conducted with cooperation of the movie's distributor and exhibitor in the Netherlands. The implementations suggest that MOVIEMOD produces reasonably accurate forecasts of box-office performance. More importantly, the model offers the opportunity to simulate the effects of alternative marketing plans. In the Dutch application, the effects of extra advertising, extra magazine articles, extra TV commercials, and higher trailer intensity (compared to the base marketing plan of the distributor) were analyzed. We demonstrate the value of these decision-support capabilities of MOVIEMOD in assisting managers to identify a final plan that resulted in an almost 50% increase in the test movie's revenue performance, compared to the marketing plan initially contemplated. Management implemented this recommended plan, which resulted in box-office sales that were within 5% of the MOVIEMOD prediction. MOVIEMOD was also tested against several benchmark models, and its prediction was better in all cases. An evaluation of MOVIEMOD jointly by the Dutch exhibitor and the distributor showed that both parties were positive about and appreciated its performance as a decision-support tool. In particular, the distributor, who has more stakes in the domestic performance of its movies, showed a great interest in using MOVIEMOD for subsequent evaluations of new movies prior to their release. Based on such evaluations and the initial validation results, MOVIEMOD can fruitfully (and inexpensively) be used to provide researchers and managers with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive audience response to new motion pictures, and it can be instrumental in developing other decision-support systems that can improve the odds of commercial success of new experiential products.","Decision support; Forecasting; Markov chains; Motion pictures; New products; Pretest market evaluation","","","","","","","","Austin B.A., Immediate Seating: A Look at Movie Audiences, (1989); Bartholomew D.J., Stochastic Models for Social Processes, (1973); Blackburn J.D., Clancy K.J., LITMUS: A new product planning model, Proceedings: Market Measurement and Analysis, pp. 182-193, (1980); Conlisk J., Interactive Markov chains, J.

Prediction of consumer behavior from attitudes, consequently, has been highly debated in recent years with researchers using beliefs-only, full, and extended multiattribute attitude models. The research underlying this paper was designed to compare the predictive superiority of the beliefs-only model, the full multiattribute attitude model, and a new representation identified as the combined multiattribute/determinant attribute attitude model. Data concerning patronage of fast-food chains were collected from a student panel for seven weeks. Predictive superiority was determined by average adjusted R2 using the patronage behavior dependent variable.

This has led experts to highlight the existence of a ""long tail"" of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is ""selling less of more."" However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Maximizers are those who always strive to make the best possible decision, whereas satisficers are those who are usually willing to settle for a ""good enough"" option. In this study, we explore the influence of the maximizing trait in situations where consumers have to make quick purchase decisions. The context for our empirical study is online gift purchases made under a time constraint. The results support our predictions that maximizers (vs. satisficers) engage in more prepurchase browsing behavior and also perceive more decision time pressure. Furthermore, these effects are moderated by the size of the available choice assortment. The results also show that maximizers are more likely to change their initial time-constrained choices if given the opportunity to do so. We discuss the implications of the research for the study of individual differences in consumer behavior and also for customizing retail sales and Internet marketing tactics based on buyer segmentation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Assortment size; Browsing behavior; Consumer decision making; Maximizing trait; Time pressure","","","","","","","","Adams L., Late Xmas shoppers a boon to retailers, Marketing Magazine, 102, (1997); Boatwright P., Nunes J.C., Reducing assortment: An attribute-based approach, Journal of Marketing, 65, pp. 50-63, (2001); Borle S., Boatwright P., Kadane J.B., Nunes J.C., Shmueli G., The effect of product assortment changes on customer retention, Marketing Science, 24, pp. 616-622, (2005); Botti S., Iyengar S.S., The dark side of choice: When choice impairs social welfare, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 25, pp. 24-38, (2006); Broniarczyk S.M., A deeper look at assortment, Advances in Consumer Research, 31, pp. 392-394, (2004); Broniarczyk S.M., Hoyer W.D., McAlister L., Consumers' perceptions of the assortment offered in a grocery category: The impact of item reduction, JMR, Journal of Marketing Research, 35, pp. 166-176, (1998); Chernev A., Decision focus and consumer choice among assortments, The Journal of Consumer Research, 33, pp. 50-59, (2006); Dhar R., Consumer preference for a no-choice option, The Journal of Consumer Research, 24, pp. 215-231, (1997); Dhar R., Nowlis S.M., The effect of time pressure on consumer choice deferral, The Journal of Consumer Research, 27, pp. 309-324, (1999); Fisman R., Iyengar S.S., Kamenica E., Simonson I., Gender differences in mate selection: Evidence from a speed dating experiment, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121, pp. 673-697, (2006); Hochschild A.R., The Time Bind, (1997); Huffman C., Kahn B.E., Variety for sale: Mass customization or mass confusion?, Journal of Retailing, 74, pp. 491-513, (1998); Iyengar S.S., Lepper M.R., When choice is demotivating: Can one desire too much of a good thing?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, pp. 995-1006, (2000); Iyengar S.S., Wells R.E., Schwartz B., Doing better but feeling worse, Psychological Science, 17, pp. 143-150, (2006); Jacoby J., Speller D.E., Kohn C.A., Brand choice behavior as a function of information load, JMR, Journal of Marketing Research, 11, pp. 63-69, (1974); Kahn B.E., Lehmann D., Modeling choice among assortments, Journal of Retailing, 67, pp. 274-299, (1991); Malhotra N., Multi-stage information processing behavior: An experimental investigation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 1, (1982); Maule A.J., Svenson O., Time Pressure and Stress in Human Judgment and Decision Making, (1993); Moorthy S., Ratchford B.T., Talukdar D., Consumer information search revisited: Theory and empirical analysis, The Journal of Consumer Research, 23, pp. 263-277, (1997); Nowlis S.M., The effect of time pressure on the choice between brands that differ in quality, price, and product features, Marketing Letters, 6, pp. 287-295, (1995); Oppewal H., Koelemeijer K., Assessing the effects of assortment and ambience: A choice experimental approach, Journal of Retailing, 75, pp. 319-345, (1999); Park W.C., Iyer E.S., Smith D.C., The effects of situational factors on in-store grocery shopping behavior: The role of store environment and time available for shopping, The Journal of Consumer Research, 15, pp. 422-433, (1989); Payne J.W., Bettman J.R., Johnson E.J., The Adaptive Decision Maker, (1993); Richins M.L., Bloch P.H., After the new wears off: The temporal context of product involvement, The Journal of Consumer Research, 43, pp. 280-285, (1986); Schwartz B., The Paradox of Choice-why More Is Less, (2004); Schwartz B., Ward A., Monterosso J., Lyubomirsky S., White K., Lehman D.R., Maximizing versus satisficing: Happiness is a matter of choice, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, pp. 1178-1197, (2002); Simon H.A., A behavioral model of rational choice, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 69, pp. 99-118, (1955); Simon H.A., Rational choice and structure of the environment, Psychological Review, 63, pp. 129-138, (1956); Simonson I., Nowlis S.M., The role of explanations and need for uniqueness in consumer decision making: Unconventional choices based on reasons, The Journal of Consumer Research, 27, pp. 49-68, (2000); Urbany J.E., Schmit J.T., Butler D.D., Urbany J.E., Buyer uncertainty and information search, The Journal of Consumer Research, 16, pp. 208-215, (1989); Wright P., Weitz B., Time horizon effects on product evaluation strategies, JMR, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, pp. 429-443, (1977); Zaichkowsky J.L., Measuring the involvement construct, The Journal of Consumer Research, 12, pp. 341-352, (1985)","T.

This study verifies the association between market capitalization and revenue, and examines economic factors that potentially influence Internet company managers' decisions to adopt allegedly aggressive revenue-recognition policies. Specifically, we examine factors hypothesized to influence the reporting of advertising barter revenue and grossed-up sales levels. We begin by providing descriptive evidence on the use of barter and grossed-up revenue across Internet sectors. Although common in some sectors, we find that the use of these accounting policies is not pervasive overall. We limit our empirical analyses to Internet companies that have the opportunity to report grossed-up or advertising barter revenue. Our cross-sectional predictions are based on both external and internal incentives to maximize revenues as well as constraints that may limit management's discretion. We predict that the following factors increase the likelihood that a firm will report grossed-up and/or barter revenue: shorter time before needing additional external financing, more active individual investor interest in the firm's stock, more active pursuit of growth via acquisitions, and greater use of stock options in employee compensation. We also posit that barter transactions might be an inexpensive way for firms to evaluate the viability of future marketing or content alliances with potential partners. Finally, we predict that constraints on management discretion are related to the reputation/quality of the firm's auditor and underwriter and the extent of management ownership. We find that firms with greater cash burn rates and higher levels of activity on Motley Fool message boards are consistently associated with barter and grossed-up revenue reporting.","","","","","","","","","Aharony J., Lin C., Loeb M., Initial public offerings, accounting choices, and earnings management, Contemporary Accounting Research, 10, 1, pp. 61-81, (1993); Avolio D., Gildor E., Shleifer A., Technology, Information Production, and Market Efficiency, (2001); Bagnoli M., Kallapur S., Watts S., Top Line Versus Bottom Line Forecasts: A Comparison, (2001); Barth M.E., Kallapur S., The effects of cross-sectional scale differences on regression results in empirical accounting research, Contemporary Accounting Research, 13, 2, pp. 527-567, (1996); Beatty R.P., Ritter J., Investment banking, reputation and the underpricing of initial public offerings, Journal of Financial Economics, 15, 1-2, pp. 213-232, (1986); Bernard V., Skinner D., What motivates managers' choice of discretionary accruals?, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 22, 1-3, pp. 313-325, (1996); Bonner S., Palmrose Z., Young S., Fraud type and auditor litigation: An analysis of SEC accounting and auditing enforcement releases, Accounting Review, 73, 4, pp. 503-533, (1998); Bowen R., Ducharme L., Shores D., Stakeholders' implicit claims and accounting method choice, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 20, 3, pp. 255-295, (1995); Bowen R., Ducharme L., Shores D., Economic and Industry Determinants of Accounting Method Choice, (1999); Campbell K., Sefcik S., Virtual Sales: Barter and Revenue Management in Internet Firms, (2002); Coffee Jr. J.C., The Acquiescent Gatekeeper: Reputational Intermediaries, Auditor Independence and the Governance of Accounting, (2001); Davis A., The value relevance of revenue for internet firms: Does reporting grossed-up and barter revenue make a difference?, Journal of Accounting Research, 40, 2, pp. 445-477, (2002); Dechow P., Sloan R., Sweeney A., Causes and consequences of earnings manipulation: An analysis of firms subject to enforcement actions by the SEC, Contemporary Accounting Research, 13, 1, pp. 1-36, (1996); Demers E., Lev B., A rude awakening: Internet value drivers in 2000, Review of Accounting Studies, 6, 2-3, pp. 331-359, (2001); Feroz E.H., Park K., Pastena V., The financial and market effects of the SEC's accounting and auditing enforcement releases, Journal of Accounting Research, 29, SUPPL., pp. 107-141, (1991); Fields T., Lys T., Vincent L., Empirical research on accounting choice, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 31, 1-3, pp. 255-307, (2001); EITF Abstract 99-17.

Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation. They then discuss two aspects of the prediction market. First, the need for better prediction for distributors of cultural products, and second, the potential for business models around prediction techniques.

To model consumer responses to direct marketing, this study proposes Bayesian networks learned by evolutionary programming. Using a large direct marketing data set, we tested the endogeneity bias in the recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) variables using the control function approach; compared the results of Bayesian networks with those of neural networks, classification and regression tree (CART), and latent class regression; and applied a tenfold cross-validation. The results suggest that Bayesian networks have distinct advantages over the other methods in accuracy of prediction, transparency of procedures, interpretability of results, and explanatory insight. Our findings lend strong support to Bayesian networks as a robust tool for modeling consumer response and other marketing problems and for assisting management decision making. © 2006 INFORMS.","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Direct marketing; Evolutionary programming; Machine learning","Behavioral research; Computer programming; Data mining; Database systems; Learning systems; Management; Marketing; Networks (circuits); Tools; Bayesian networks; Direct marketing; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Leone R.P., Jen L., A dynamic model of purchase timing with application to direct marketing, J.

The study's hypotheses are developed by integrating the motivational qualities of Weiner's attribution theory with the behavioral predictions of four popular risk perspectives: prospect theory, the hot-hand effect, the competency hypothesis, and risk as hazard. The research question is reflected in two sets of hypotheses that experimentally examine the relationship between valenced (was the outcome good or bad) attributions (why did the outcome happen) and changes in the riskiness (chance and size of loss) of managers' new-product introduction decisions. Three-way interactions are found that support the study's attribution-based framework and address predictive differences among the four risk perspectives. Implications for the theories examined and the management of the new-product development process are discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Anderson R., Kulhavy R., Andre T., Feedback procedures in programmed instructions, Journal of Educational Psychology, 62, pp. 148-156, (1971);

When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage. The data in both studies are consistent with the model predictions.","","Competition; Decision making; Marketing; Mathematical models; Optimization; Purchasing; Competitive strategy; Coupons; Loyalty programs; Marketing mix; Sales promotions; Sales","","","","","","","Bawa K., Modeling inertia and variety seeking tendencies in brand choice behavior, Marketing Sci., 9, pp. 263-278, (1990); 19th Annual Survey of Promotional Practices, (1997); Dhar S.K., Morrison D.G., Raju J.S., The effect of package coupons on brand choice: An epilogue on profits, Marketing Sci., 15, pp. 192-203, (1996); Fader P.S., Lattin J.M., Accounting for heterogeneity and nonstationarity in a cross-sectional model of consumer purchase behavior, Marketing Sci., 12, pp. 304-317, (1993); Feinberg F.M., Kahn B., McAlister L., Market share response when consumers seek variety, J.

Box 308, Norway","Transaction cost analysis (TCA) keeps the frequency of exchange as a significant dimension of business-to-business transactions, and the transaction frequency is expected to influence how to align inter-firm organization efficiently. To date, transaction frequency has received little attention in empirical TCA-studies. This research focuses in particular on order frequency in industrial purchasing relationships and how it affects the alignment of purchase contracting and hierarchical governance in supplier-manufacturer relationships. Data from a survey of 160 industrial purchasing relationships supports the basic TCA prediction stating that increased transaction frequency will provide administrative economies of scale benefits under conditions with substantial hazards of trade. The empirical findings demonstrate that the association between manufacturer-specific assets and formalized purchase contracting is highly dependent on the present level of exchange frequency. In manufacturer-supplier relationships with modest exchange frequency, there is no significant association between asset specificity and contractual governance. On the other hand, the effect of manufacturer-specific assets on formalized purchase contracting was substantial in relationships with high order frequency. This governance pattern was replicated in the analysis of hierarchical governance. Substantial investments in manufacturer-specific assets enforced the manufacturer's decision control over the supplier under conditions with high exchange frequency.

Product developers must carefully balance a variety of factors, including predictions of consumer price sensitivity as well as which combination of product attributes will be most valued by the intended market. A well-chosen mix of analytical tools can enhance a firm's chances of accurately predicting market demand. Chuck Tomkovick and Kathryn E. Dobie describe how the integration of two product attribute assessment techniques-hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys-allows product designer to more accurately gauge price sensitivity and market receptivity to new product designs. They also describe how these analytical tools were used to improve decision-making in product development at the Parker Pen Company, and they discuss the role these tools can play in facilitating the transition from concept to commercialization. Hedonic price analysis is an econometric method for determining the value purchasers place on attributes of existing products. In product development, factorial surveys are used to identify the value members of the target market place on new product concepts and prototypes. When used in combination with identified hedonic prices, the responses to a factorial survey allow product developers to predict consumer willingness-to-pay for various combinations of new product attributes. Following development of prototypes for two new product lines, product developers at the Parker Pen Company used hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys as a means for reducing demand uncertainty and for clarifying what consumers were willing to pay for various combinations of product attributes that were under consideration. The integration and use of these techniques involved a five-step process of target market identification, product attribute identification, hedonic price estimation, administering of the factorial survey, and determination of consumer willingness-to-pay. The results of these analyses allowed Parker Pen to better focus product development efforts on those design elements for which test market customers indicated both demand and willingness-to-pay. The Parker Pen Company found hedonic pricing and factorial surveys useful for predicting both the rat and the degree of change in consumers' marginal utility for specific product attributes. The usefulness of these techniques also extends beyond the early stages of new product conception. These techniques are helpful in the development and implementation of dynamic new product marketing mix strategies, including such elements as product design, pricing, channel selection, and promotion. © 1995.","","","","","","","","","Agrawal, Ratchford, Estimating demand functions for product characteristics the case of automobiles, Journal of Consumer Research, 7, pp. 249-262, (1980); Bartik, The estimation of demand parameters in hedonic price models, Journal of Political Economy, 95, 1, pp. 81-88, (1987); Bender, Gronberg, Hwang, Choice of functional form and the demand for air quality, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 62, pp. 638-643, (1980); Bitros, Panas, Measuring product changes under conditions of quality changes the case of passenger cars in Greece, The Journal of Industrial Economics, 37, 2, pp. 167-186, (1988); Brooks, The changing process of innovation: implications for the automobile industry, Marketing and Research Today, 20, pp. 215-226, (1992); Brown, Mendelsohn, The hedonic travel cost method, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 66, pp. 427-433, (1984); Inexpensive pens, Consumer Reports, 48, pp. 229-233, (1983); Inexpensive pens, Consumer Reports, 48, (1983); Court, Entrepreneurial and consumer demand theories for commodity spectra, Econometrica, 9, 1, pp. 135-162, (1941); Cropper, Deck, McConnell, On the choice of functional form for hedonic price functions, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 70, 4, pp. 668-675, (1988); Czinkota, Ronkainen, International Marketing, (1988); Day, Analysis for Strategic Market Decisions, (1986); Dobie, The Use of Rebates as a Marketing Strategy Tool: A Study of Rebate Efficiency, Unpublished Dissertation, (1992); Farrell, Stuck!

How can the firm account for varying information availability at different stages of the new product launch and generate forecasts at each stage? We address these questions in the context of the sequential launches of motion pictures in international markets. Players in the motion picture industry require forecasts at different stages of the movie launch process to aid decision-making, and the information sets available to generate such forecasts vary at different stages. Despite the importance of such forecasts, the industry struggles to understand and predict sales of new movies in domestic and overseas markets. We develop a Bayesian modeling framework that predicts first-week viewership for new movies in both domestic and several international markets. We focus on the first week because industry players involved in international markets (studios, distributors, and exhibitors) are most interested in these predictions. We draw on existing literature on forecasting performance of new movies to formulate our model. Specifically, we model the number of viewers of a movie in a given week using a Poisson count data model. The number of screens, distribution strategy, movie attributes such as genre, and presence/absence of stars are among the factors modeled to influence viewership. We employ a hierarchical Bayes formulation of the Poisson model that allows the determinants of viewership to vary across countries. We adopt the Bayesian approach for two reasons: First, it provides a convenient framework to model varying assumptions of information availability; specifically, it allows us to make forecasts by combining different sources of information such as domestic and international market-specific data. Second, this methodology provides us with the entire distribution of the new movie's performance forecast. Such a predictive distribution is more informative than a point estimate and provides a measure of the uncertainty in the forecasts. We propose a Bayesian prediction procedure that provides viewership forecasts at different stages of the new movie release process. The methodology provides forecasts under a number of information availability scenarios. Thus, forecasts can be obtained with just information from a historical database containing data on previous new product launches in several international markets. As more information becomes available, the forecasting methodology allows us to combine historical information with data on the performance of the new product in the domestic market and thereby to make forecasts with less uncertainty and greater accuracy. Our results indicate that for all the countries in the data set the number of screens on which a movie is released is the most important influence on viewership. Furthermore, we find that local distribution improves movie sales internationally in contrast to the domestic market. We also find evidence of similar genre preferences in geographically disparate countries. We find that the proposed model provides accurate forecasts at the movie-country level. Further, the model outperforms all the extant models in the marketing literature that could potentially be used for making these forecasts. A comparison of root mean square and mean absolute errors for movies in a hold out sample shows that the model that combines information available from the different sources generates the lowest errors. A Bayesian predictive model selection criterion corroborates the superior performance of this model. We demonstrate that the Bayesian model can be combined with industry rules of thumb to generate cumulative box office forecasts. In summary, this research demonstrates a Bayesian modeling framework that allows the use of different information sources to make new product forecasts in domestic and international markets. Our results underscore the theme that each movie is unique as is each country-and viewership results from an interaction of the product and the market. Hence, the motion picture industry should use both product-specific and market-specific information to make new movie performance forecasts.","Forecasting; Hierarchical Bayes; International Markets; Motion Pictures; New Products","","","","","","","","Allenby G.M., Ginter J.L., Using extremes to design products and segment markets, J.

We accomplish these objectives as follows. First, we use decision theory to find an expression for the expected value of marketing expertise. We do not use decision-analysis in the normative tradition. Nor do we assume that firms actually use formal decision-analysis. Rather, we assume that firms are rational and that decision theory describes their actions. Given that assumption, we predict how firms should evaluate marketing. Here, marketing expertise helps a firm make better marketing decisions (at least on average). Hence, the value of marketing expertise increases as marketing decisions become more important. Second, consistent with decision theory, we predict that marketing decisions become more important with increases in the instability of the marketing environment (i.e., predictability), the profit impact of marketing decisions (i.e., opportunity profit), and the loss from marketing mistakes (i.e., potential loss). Third, we construct empirical measures of our theoretical constructs with data from 592 firms. Our empirical results are consistent with our predictions and reveal factors influencing the value of marketing expertise. For example, greater market instability and market presence increase the value of marketing expertise, while larger organization size, organization instability, and competition decrease its value.","Decision Analysis; Expertise; Marketing; Value","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Strategic Market Management, 2nd Ed, (1988); Managing Assets and Skills: The Key to Sustainable Competitive Advantage, California Management Review, 31, 2, pp. 91-106, (1989); Argyris C., Organization and Innovation, (1965); Bagozzi R., Marketing as Exchange, J.

From the revised corpus of theory, it is hoped that some valuable predictions about consumer behaviour can be made, that may aid our understanding and decision-making in certain spheres of marketing. © 1973, MCB UP Limited","","","","","","","","","Majumdar T., The Measurement of Utility, Macmillan, (1958); Lancaster K., Consumer Demand, (1971); Becker A., A theory of the allocation of time, Economic Journal, pp. 493-517, (1965); Strotz R.H., The Empirical Implications of a Utility Tree, Econometrica, pp. 269-280, (1957); Mishan E., Consumer Behaviour: A Cynical View, Economica, pp. 1-11, (1961); Kotler P., Marketing Management, pp. 82-83, (1972); Stigler G., The Economics of Information, Journal of Political Economy, pp. 213-225, (1961); Mincer J., Market prices, opportunity costs and income effects, Measurement in economics, (1964); Farley J.U., Economics of Information and Brand Loyalty, Journal of Business, pp. 370-382, (1964); Nelson P., Information and Consumer Behaviour, Journal of Political Economy, pp. 311-329, (1971); Evans A.W., On the Theory of the Valuation and Allocation of Time, Scottish Journal of Political Economy; Rochefort P., A Model of Inter-regional Transportation Demand, Regional Planning: London Papers in Regional Science 2, (1971); Proof of evidence to Roskill No. 505 Subject Group E Surface Transport; Lowe J.F., A survey of the nature and potential fo-winter motorail services between London and Scotland; Levitt T., Marketing Myopia, Harnard Business Review, pp. 45-56, (1960); Levitt T., Improving sales through product augmentation, European Business, (1969); Main J., Meanwhile Back at the Gas Pumps—A Battle for Markets, Fortum, pp. 201-212, (1969); Engel J., Et al., Consumer behaviour, (1968); Frank R., Is brand loyalty a useful basis for market segmentation?, Journal of Advertising Research, pp. 27-33, (1967); Stafford J.E., Effects of Group Influence on Consumer Brand Preference, journal of Market Research, pp. 68-75, (1966); Atkins, Churcher, An econometric anal) sis of the brand share changes in the British butter market, Proceedings of the XVIIIth Dairy Congress, (1970)","","","","","","","","","03090566","","","","English","Eur.

Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers’ responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity – a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making. In this research, a case study is used as an example to demonstrate how marketing managers can use the information from a choice-based conjoint derived choice model differently depending on the manner in which the model validation is carried out. © 2009 Market Research Society.","","","","","","","","","Adamowicz W., Habit formation and variety seeking in a discrete choice model of recreation demand, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 19, 1, pp. 19-31, (1994); Allenby G., Fennell G., Huber J., Adjusting choice models to better predict market behavior, Marketing Letters, 16, 3-4, pp. 197-208, (2005); Armstrong J.S., Shapiro A., Analyzing quantitative models, Journal of Marketing, 38, 2, pp. 61-66, (1974); Backhaus K., Hillig T., Wilken R., Predicting purchase decisions with different conjoint analysis methods: a Monte Carlo simulation, International Journal of Market Research, 49, 3, pp. 341-364, (2007); Bemmaor A.C., Franses P.H., The diffusion of market science in the practitioners’ community: opening the black box, Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry, 21, 4-5, pp. 289-301, (2005); Ben-Akiva M.E., Morikawa T., Estimation of switching models from revealed preferences and stated intentions, Transportation Research, 24, 6, pp. 485-495, (1990); Bradlow E., Current issues and a ‘wish list’ for conjoint analysis, Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry, 21, 4-5, pp. 319-323, (2005); Campo K., Gijsbrechts E., Guerra F., Computer simulated shopping experiments for analyzing dynamic purchasing patterns: validation and guidelines, Journal of Empirical Generalizations in Marketing Science, 4, pp. 22-61, (1999); Cook T., Campbell D., Design and Analysis of Quasi -Experimental Design for Research, (1979); Elrod T., Recommendations for validation of choice models, Proceedings of the Sawtooth Software Conference, pp. 225-243, (2001); Green P.E., Krieger A., Wind Y., Thirty years of conjoint analysis: reflections and prospects, Interfaces, 31, 3, pp. 56-73, (2001); Hensher D.A., Bradley M., Using stated response choice data to enrich revealed preference discrete choice models, Marketing Letters, 4, 2, pp. 139-151, (1993); Huber J.C., Wittink D.R., Fiedler J.A., Miller R.L., The effectiveness of alternative preference elicitation procedures in predicting choice, Journal of Marketing Research, 30, 1, pp. 105-114, (1993); Juster F., Consumer buying intentions and purchase probability: an experiment in survey design, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 61, 315, pp. 658-696, (1966); Laurent G., Improving the external validity of market models: a plea for more qualitative input, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 17, 2-3, pp. 177-182, (2000); Liefeld J., Consumer research in the land of Oz, Marketing Research, 15, 1, pp. 10-15, (2003); Little J., Models and managers: the concept of a decision calculus, Management Science, 16, 8, pp. 466-485, (1970); Louviere J., Conjoint analysis modelling of stated preferences.

Given a set of alternatives, each with multiple attributes, what is the probability that a decision maker will choose a certain alternative? Initially psychologists, then economists and marketing strategists, more recently transportation policy makers and design engineers have employed logit models. A brief review of these models is given in an attempt to show their relevance to more general decision-making situations, and their descriptiveness of human decision-making processes. A new model which synthesizes the desirable features of earlier models is then presented. The new model is applied to an actual case of predicting customer purchase probabilities for a particular brand of an industrial product. The prediction capability of the model is externally validated statistically, using real data, by comparing model results with the actual market share of the company. © 1985 Operational Research Society Ltd.","Decision making; Marketing; Probabilistic choice; Utility theory","HEALTH CARE; TRANSPORTATION; WATER RESOURCES; DECISION MAKING; LOGIT MODEL; PROBABILISTIC CHOICE; UTILITY THEORY; DECISION THEORY AND ANALYSIS","","","","","","","Richards M.G., Ben-Akiva M.E., A Disaggregated Travel Demand Model, (1975); McFadden D., Econometric models for probabilistic choice among products, J.

This model defines an individual's attitude about a particular college or university as the importance the individual attaches to a specific attribute of the school, and the belief that the institution under consideration possesses that attribute. In this study we extend the model by investigating the importance of applicants' attitudes about competitor institutions, and by controlling for demographic and ability factors that may affect attitudes. Our research demonstrates that attitudes have a significant, positive relationship to enrollment decisions. As well, we incorporate an attitude difference measure that contrasts applicants' attitudes about one institution compared to admissions competitors. Addition of this variable to the prediction equation substantially improved our ability to forecast an applicant's matriculation decision. © 1990 Human Sciences Press, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Aldrich, Nelson, Linear Probability, LOGIT, and PROBIT Models, (1984); Campbell, Spiro, Focusing on a neglected component of the student selection process: A state-wide survey of high school guidance counselors, (1983); Chapman, Jackson, College Choices of Academically Able Students: The Influence of No-Need Financial Aid and Other Factors, (1987); Cook, Zallocco, Predicting university preference and attendance: Applied marketing in higher education administration, Research in Higher Education, 19, 2, pp. 197-211, (1983); Greene, LIMDEP User's Manual, (1986); Lay R, Designing and Using Market Research, (1987); Litten, Market structure and institutional position in geographic market segments, Research in Higher Education, 11, 1, pp. 59-83, (1979); Maguire, Lay, Modelling the college choice process: Image and decision, College and University, 56, pp. 123-139, (1981); Manski, Wise, College Choice in America, (1983); Perry R.F., Rumpf D.L., Predicting the likelihood of matriculation for college applicants, Research in Higher Education, 21, 3, pp. 317-328, (1984); Sternberg R.J., Davis J.C., Student perceptions of Yale and its competitors, College and University, 53, pp. 262-279, (1978)","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers-Human Sciences Press","","","","","","1573188X","","","","English","Res High Educ","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0010090009"

The authors show that the distribution of these estimates provides useful information for effectively managing marketing activities. In addition, the proposed model relates the measures of influence to covariates useful for identifying high-influence individuals.

Specifically, we manipulate the number of consumer recommendations and measure motivation to process information in a realistic online shopping environment. Consistent with predictions of dual information processing theories, we find that the amount of eWOM has a significant impact on buyer confidence in product choice. In addition, we find that for buyers less motivated to process information, the effect of eWOM on their choice confidence is mediated by their attitude towards the recommended product, suggesting that the amount of eWOM functions as a purchase cue.

Managers in such markets are interested in better understanding when to accommodate (i.e., decrease marketing spending) or retaliate (i.e., increase spending) in nonprice marketing variables such as advertising and salesforce. In addition, the reallocation of marketing resources toward advertising (indicated by a pull strategy) or salesforce (indicated by a push strategy) upon entry is strategically important to managers. Previous theoretical research shows that pioneers should retaliate in both static and growing markets. Results from empirical research are mixed in that they support both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets. Empirical research also shows that a pioneer accommodates (retaliates) with its low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Contrary to prior research, however, some pioneers have successfully accommodated late movers in growing markets, and in some cases, have accommodated with their stronger marketing mix variables and also retaliated with their weaker marketing mix variables. For example, Bristol Myers Squibb's Capoten accommodated the entry of Merck's Vasotec in the growing ace-inhibitors market with its more powerful variable, salesforce, but also retaliated with its less potent variable, advertising. Moreover, not much is known about how the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should change (i.e., toward pull vs. push strategies) in response to new entries. We seek to better explain the pioneer's reactions and predict its shift in marketing mix allocation upon new entry. We note that prior research's predictions on the pioneer's reactions are based on a limited number of key factors such as product-market characteristics and the pioneer's elasticities prior to a new entry. In this paper, we extend previous research by adding two other critical factors, namely, the impact of new entry on the pioneer's elasticities and margin, and different competitive game structures to better predict and explain the pioneer's reactions. We develop analytical results on the pioneer's reactions in price, advertising, and salesforce in different competitive games (both Nash and different leader-follower games). In these results we identify the conditions under which the pioneer should accommodate, or retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift its marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies. We empirically illustrate some of the analytical results using data from a pharmaceutical category. We show that a pioneer who adopts a follower (leader) role with respect to a marketing mix variable in a static (growing) market, and witnesses a decrease (an increase) in own elasticity and margin upon a new entry, generally should accommodate (retaliate) in that variable. However, we are also able to show that there are cases where these general reactions don't hold. Thus, for example, it is possible for a pioneer to find it optimal to accommodate in a growing market or to retaliate even when its elasticity decreases upon entry, depending on the combination of competitive game, the impact of entry on elasticities and margin, and market growth. In this way, our results point to the fact that it is necessary to look not only at one factor at a time, but instead examine the combination of all the factors. We explain the empirical support for both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets by showing that the pioneer should accommodate (retaliate) a late mover with its competitively low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Competitively high (low) elasticity variables are not (are) likely to be significantly reduced by a new entry in the anticipated competitive game. With regard to reallocation of the pioneer's marketing mix, we show that the change in the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should follow the change in the relative marketing mix effectiveness after new entry. This, in turn, depends on the structure of competition, the impact of the late mover on its elasticities and margins, and the competitor's marketing mix elasticities, in addition to own elasticities. The results can guide managers on how factors such as competitive structure, changes in elasticities and margin, and market growth impact the pioneer's marketing mix decisions, and on when to accommodate, retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies.","Competitive Strategy;

Design/methodology/approach - The study involved collection of information and data from the literature and the Norwegian oil and gas (O&G) industry. A survey was conducted to get an overview of existing practices and guided interviews were conducted to confirm the findings of the survey. Findings - The study indicates that the market needs are considered the most important innovation process driver, feedback from the customers is the most important activity to encourage service innovations, whilst return on investments is the most important decision-making factor in evaluating innovation feasibility. Employees are the most important source of innovation ideas. Furthermore, interactions between different companies, as well as involvement of customer, employees and suppliers in the innovation process are becoming increasingly important. Practical implications - The study shows that service providers and receivers often collaborate in the innovation processes, and that many of the activities are performed simultaneously. This results in the collaborative parties needing to put resources on managing and coordinating the innovation process in a structured, effective and efficient way. The proposed framework for service innovation management and coordination provides practitioners with a structured approach to manage industrial service innovations. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on the data collected from a number of companies from the O&G industry in Norway. Originality/value - The paper identifies different innovation process drivers and activities and proposes a modified framework for industrial services innovation management and coordination based on the study analysis, interaction with the practitioners and using available literature on innovation management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Gas industry;

These databases enable the estimation of demand functions and pricing/promotion decisions in ""real"" time. Commercial suppliers of marketing research like A. C. Nielsen and IRI are embedding estimated demand functions in promotion planning and pricing tools for brand managers and retailers. This explosion in the estimation and use of demand functions makes it timely and appropriate to re-examine several fundamental issues. In particular, demand functions are latent theoretical constructs whose exact parametric form is unknown. Estimates of price elasticities, profit maximizing prices, interbrand competition and other policy implications are conditional on the parametric form assumed in estimation. In practice, many forms may be found that are not only theoretically plausible but also consistent with the data. The different forms could suggest different profit maximizing prices leaving it unclear as to what is the appropriate pricing action. Specification tests may lack the power to resolve this uncertainty, particularly for non-nested comparisons. Also, the structure of these tests does not permit seamless integration of estimation, specification analysis and optimal pricing into a unified framework. As an alternative to the existing approaches, I propose a Bayesian mixture model (BMM) that draws on Bayesian estimation, inference, and decision theory, thereby providing a unified framework. The BMM approach consists of input, estimation, diagnostic and optimal pricing modules. In the input module, alternate parametric models of demand are specified along with priors. Utility structures representing the decision maker's attitude towards risk can be explicitly specified. In the estimation module, the inputs are combined with data to compute parameter estimates and posterior probabilities for the models. The diagnostic module involves testing the statistical assumptions underlying the models. In the optimal pricing module the estimates and posterior probabilities are combined with the utility structure to arrive at optimal pricing decisions. Formalizing demand uncertainty in this manner has many important payoffs. While the classical approaches emphasize choosing a demand specification, the BMM approach emphasizes constructing an objective function that represents a mixture of the specifications. Hence, pricing decisions can be arrived at even when there is no consensus among the different parametric specifications. The pricing decisions will reflect parametric demand uncertainty, and hence be more robust than those based on a single demand model. The BMM approach was empirically evaluated using store level scanner data. The decision context was the determination of equilibrium wholesale prices in a noncooperative game between several leading national brands. Retail demand was parametrized as semilog and doublelog with diffuse priors for the models and the parameters. Wholesale demand functions were derived by incorporating the retailers' pricing behavior in the retail demand function. Utility functions reflecting risk averse and risk neutral decision makers were specified. The diagnostic module confirms that face validity measures, residual analysis, classical tests or holdout predictions were unable to resolve the uncertainty about the parametric form and by implication the uncertainty with regard to pricing decisions. In contrast, the posterior probabilities were more conclusive and favored the specification that predicted better in a holdout analysis. However, across the brands, they lacked a systematic pattern of updating towards any one specification. Also, none of the priors updated to zero or one, and there was considerable residual uncertainty about the parametric specification. Despite the residual uncertainty, the BMM approach was able to determine the equilibrium wholesale prices. As expected, specifications influence the BMM pricing solutions in accordance with their posterior probabilities which act as weights. In addition, differing attitudes towards risk lead to considerable divergence in the pricing actions of the risk averse and the risk neutral decision maker. Finally, results from a Monte Carlo experiment suggest that the BMM approach performs well in terms of recovering potential improvements in profits.","Bayesian econometrics; Decision theory; Demand structures; Nonnested models; Pricing; Regression; Scanner data","","","","","","","","Aitchison J., Brown J.A.C., The Lognormal Distribution, (1957); Allenby G.M., Hypothesis testing with scanner data: The advantage of Bayesian methods, Journal of Marketing Research, 27, pp. 379-389, (1991); Balasubramanian S.K., Jain D.C., Simple approaches to evaluating competing non-nested models in marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 11, pp. 53-72, (1994); Barry C.B., Wildt A.R., Statistical model comparison in marketing research, Management Science, 24, pp. 387-392, (1977); Berger J.O., Selke T., Testing a point null hypothesis: The irreconcilability of p values and evidence, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 82, 397, pp. 112-122, (1987); Berger J.O., Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, Second Edition, (1985); Blattberg R.C., Sen S.K., A Bayesian technique to discriminate between stochastic models of brand choice, Management Science, 21, 6, pp. 682-696, (1975); Bolton R.N., The relationship between market characteristics and promotional price elasticities, Marketing Science, 8, 2, pp. 153-169, (1989); Box G.E.P., Cox D.R., An analysis of transformations (with discussion), Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 26, pp. 211-252, (1964); Casella G., George E.I., Explaining the gibbs sampler, The American Statistician, 46, 3, pp. 167-173, (1992); Cox D.R., Further results on tests of separate families of hypothesis, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 24, pp. 406-424, (1962); Davidson R., MacKinnon J.G., Several tests for model specification in the presence of alternate hypothesis, Econometrica, 49, pp. 781-793, (1981); Draper N.H., Smith H., Applied Regression Analysis, Second Edition, (1981); Eliashberg J., Hauser J.R., A measurement error approach for modeling consumer risk preference, Management Science, 31, 1, pp. 1-25, (1985); Fraser D.A.S., The Structure of Inference, (1968); Friedman J.W., Oligopoly and the Theory of Games, (1977); Guadagni P.M., Little J.D.C., A Logit model of brand choice calibrated on scanner data, Marketing Science, 2, 3, pp. 203-238, (1983); Hansen P.L., Singleton K.J., Stochastic consumption, risk aversion, and the temporal behavior of asset returns, Journal of Political Economy, 91, 2, pp. 249-265, (1983); Hanson W.A., The dynamics of cost plus pricing, Managerial and Decision Economics, 13, pp. 149-161, (1992); Hauser J.R., Urban G.L., Assessment of attribute importances and consumer utility functions: Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory applied to consumer behavior, Journal of Consumer Research, 5, pp. 251-262, (1979); Ingersoll J.E.

Forecast methodologies which can predict PLCs accurately can help to achieve successful strategic decision-making, forecasting, and foresight activities in high-technology firms, research institutes, governments, and universities. Over the past few decades, even though analytic framework strategies have been proposed for production, marketing, R&D (research and development), and finance, aiming at each stage of PLCs, forecast methodologies with which to predict PLCs are few. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel forecast methodology to allow for predictions of product life time (PLT) and the annual shipment of products during the entire PLC of multiple generation products. A novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, the product life-time of the specific generation to be analyzed will be predicted by the fuzzy piecewise regression line that is derived based upon the product life-time of earlier generations. In the second stage of the forecast methodology, the annual shipment of products of the specified generation will be predicted by deriving annual fuzzy regression lines for each generation, based upon the historical data on the earlier generations' products. An empirical study predicting the life-time and the annual shipment of the 16 Mb (Mega bit) DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) PLC is illustrated to validate the analytical process. The results demonstrate that two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis can predict multiple generation PLT and PLC precisely, thereby serving as a foundation for future strategic planning, policy definitions and foresights. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This is especially true in the growth stage of product innovation, because major investments and marketing decisions are made in this phase. By examining recent empirical studies focusing on consumer behavior in high-technology markets, several factors are identified that can affect individual buying decisions and aggregate sales, namely, interpersonal communication, democratization of innovation, direct and indirect network effects, forward-looking behavior, and consumer heterogeneity. Against this background the diffusion-modeling and the utility-based approach are reviewed in terms of their basic conception and their applicability to the markets concerned. Based on this investigation a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, specifically in the growth stage, is developed. The model has a utility-theoretic background and a logistic structure. Since data are scarce in this early stage of the product life cycle two versions of the new approach are discussed, an extended version considering forward-looking behavior and a more parsimonious (""myopic"") one. The performance of the new model is demonstrated using real sales data on the CD player, the DVD player/recorder, and the digital camera market. The empirical comparisons include alternative specifications of the Bass diffusion model as well as a proportional hazard model and consist of two steps. First, the models are checked as to whether they are able to represent the sales data at all. It is shown that both versions of the proposed model are at least equivalent, if not superior, to the models used as benchmarks in terms of fit. In the next step, the models are applied to predict future sales in the three markets. The resulting forecasts show that the proposed model performs significantly better than its benchmarks. Its parsimony enables reliable predictions, even in cases, where only short time series are available for parameter estimation. The model is able to anticipate decreasing diffusion rates as they occur at the end of the growth stage and, thus, helps to avoid overoptimistic sales forecasts, which may cause severe economic damages. The new approach is easy to calibrate and can be applied without specialized econometric expertise. © 2009 Product Development & Management Association.","","Behavioral research; Cameras; Commerce; Communication; Diffusion; Forecasting; Innovation; Parameter estimation; Profitability; Time series; Bass Diffusion Model; Buying decisions; Consumer behaviors; Diffusion rate; Economic damages; Empirical comparison; Empirical studies; Extended versions; Growth stages; High tech companies; High-tech products; High-technology; Indirect network effects; Inter-personal communications; Marketing decision; New approaches; New model; Product innovation; Product life cycles; Proportional hazard models; Real sales data; Sales forecasting; Sales projections; Short time series; Sales","","","","","","","Armstrong J.S., Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners, (2001); Bass F.M., A new product growth model for consumer durables, Management Science, 15, 5, pp. 215-227, (1969); Bass F.M., Jain D.C., Krishnan T.V., Modeling the marketing-mix influence in new-product diffusion, New-Product Diffusion Models, pp. 99-122, (2000); Bass F.M., Krishnan T.V., Jain D.C., Why the bass model fits without decision variables, Marketing Science, 13, 3, pp. 203-223, (1994); Boswijk H.P., Franses P.H., On the econometrics of the bass diffusion model, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 23, 3, pp. 255-268, (2005); Bridges E., Yim C.K., Briesch R.A., A high-tech product market share model with customer expectations, Marketing Science, 14, 1, pp. 61-81, (1995); Church J., Gandal N., Network effects, software provision, and standardization, Journal of Industrial Economics, 40, 1, pp. 85-103, (1992); Church J., Gandal N., Krause D., Indirect Network Effects and Adoption Externalities, Working Paper 02-30, (2002); Easingwood C.J., Mahajan V., Muller E., A nonuniform influence innovation diffusion model of new product acceptance, Marketing Science, 2, 3, pp. 273-295, (1983); Erdem T., Keane M.P., Strebel J., Learning about computers: An analysis of information search and technology choice, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, 3, 3, pp. 207-247, (2005); Goldenberg J., Libai B., Muller E., Riding the saddle: How cross-market communications can create a major slump in sales, Journal of Marketing, 66, pp. 1-16, (2002); Goldenberg J., Libai B., Muller E., Is the bandwagon rolling?

The traditional methods used for forecasting include time series methods and causal methods. In the paper, we present an Analytic Hierarchy Process-based approach to demand forecasting. The proposed decision support system offers many improvements compared to traditional methods, such as the possibility to include both tangible and intangible factors in the forecasting process, and the ability to make predictions about the future development of the environmental factors.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Decision support systems; Demand Forecasting","Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Industrial management; Marketing; Optimization; Planning; Analytic hierarchy process; Demand forecasting; Multiple criteria decision tool; Inventory control","","","","","","","Gattorna J., Creating an effective logistics systems solution: The role of people, Asia Pacific Int.

Therefore, one reason was found as the ultimate source to explain why a fashion style/ trend was spread to the mass market. However, the existing market is complex and difficult to find out the holistic reason to explain fashion consumption. In this study, the chaotic perspective is taken into account to investigate the relationship between fashion change and fashion consumption. By using the grounded theory method, 33 in-depth interviews were conducted. A chaotic fashion consumption model is developed from the findings to explain how different fashions are consumed and rejected while fashion changes. It is found that the interaction of being fashionable, perceived fashionability and system participation affects the ultimate decision on fashion consumption. It is also found that a pattern can be traced to forecast the degree of fashion consumption even when the fashion change phenomenon is chaotic. Thus, it is similar to the principle of chaos theory that short-term prediction is possible in relation to the degree of fashion acceptance among consumers. Marketing implications are suggested with reference to the chaotic fashion consumption model. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumers; Fashion; Social change; Young adults","consumer research; fashion","","","","","","","Behling D., Fashion change and demographics: a model, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 4, pp. 18-24, (1985); Blumer H., Fashion: from class differentiation to collective selection, The Sociological Quarterly, 10, pp. 275-291, (1969); Briggs J., Peat F.D., Turbilent Mirror: An Illustrated Guide to Chaos Theory and the Science of Wholeness, (1989); Burawoy M., The Extended Case Method in Ethnography, (1991); Cholachatpinyo A., Padgett I., Crocker M., A conceptual model of the fashion process – Part 1, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 6, 1, pp. 11-23, (2002); Clifford G., Local Knowledge, (1983); Ditto W., Munakata T., Principles and application of chaotic systems, Communications of the ACM, 38, 11, pp. 96-102, (1995); 146, (2001); Fring G.S., Fashion: From Concept to Consumers, (1994); Gillies P., Complexity and Postmodernism: Understanding Complex Systems, pp. 89-109, (1998); Goldsmith R.E., Flynn L.R., Moore M.A., The self-concept of fashion leaders, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 14, 4, pp. 243-248, (1996); Goulding C., Grounded theory: the missing methodology on the interpretivist agenda, Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 1, 1, pp. 50-57, (1998); Kaiser, Et al., Construction of an ST theory of fashion: part 1, ambivalence and change, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 13, 3, pp. 172-183, (1995); Kean R., The role of fashion system in fashion change: a response to the Kasier, Nagasawa and Hutton model, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 5, 3, pp. 8-15, (1997); King C.W., Fashion adoption: a rebuttal to the ‘trickle down theory’, Perspectives of Fashion, pp. 31-39, (1963); King C., Sproles G.B., Predictive efficacy of psychopersonality characteristics in fashion change agent identification, pp. 845-848, (1973); Krueger R.A., A Practical Guide for Applied Research, (1994); Kwon Y.H., Workman J.E., Relationship of optimum stimulation level to fashion behaviour, Clothing and Textile Research Journal, 14, 4, pp. 249-256, (1996); Lornenz E., The butterfly effect, Chaos: Making a New Science, pp. 9-32, (1988); Morgan D.L., Focus Group as Qualitative Research, (1997); Noble C.H., Mokwa M.P., Implementing marketing strategies: developing and testing a managerial theory, Journal of Marketing, 63, pp. 57-73, (1999); Palegato R., Wall M., Information seeking by fashion opinion leaders and followers, Home Economic Research Journal, 8, pp. 327-338, (1990); Polhemus T., Fashion anti-fashion and the body image, New Society, 11, pp. 73-76, (1973); Richardson G.P., Feedback Thought in Social Science and Systems Theory, (1991); Rust L., Parents and children shopping together: a new approach to the qualitative analysis of the observation data, Journal of Advertising Research, pp. 65-70, (1993); Simmel G., Fashion, International Quarterly, 10, pp. 130-155, (1904); Sproles G.B., Consumer Behaviour Towards Dress, (1979); Strauss A.L., Qualitative Analysis for Social Scientists, (1987); Strauss A., Corbin J., Basics of Qualitative Research, (1990); Symon G., Cassell C., Qualitative Methods and Analysis in Organisational Research, (1998); Tai H.C., Tam L.M., A lifestlye analysis, Journal of International Consumer Marketing, 9, 1, pp. 25-42, (1996); Hong Kong Official Guide, (1998); Walkers R., Applied Qualitative Research, (1985); Workman J.E., Kidd L.K., Use of the uniqueness scale to characterize fashion consumer groups, Clothing and Textile Research Journal, 18, 4, pp. 227-236, (2000); Young T.R., Chaos theory and sysmoblic interactionist theory: poetics for the postmodern sociologist, Symbolic Interaction, 14, 3, pp. 321-334, (1991); Hamilton J.A., The Macro-micro interface in the construction of individual fashion involvement forms and meanings, Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, 15, 3, pp. 164-171, (1997)","","","","","","","","","13612026","","","","English","J.

The authors suggest a framework for determining an optimum strategy based on the firm's market (global or local) and the strength of its strategic and marketing assets. They test the framework by studying the response strategies to MNC entry of 78 Israeli firms, tracking their reactions from 1993 to 1999, as significantly more MNCs entered the market. Was the model able to predict which strategies were selected by the firms? For firms competing in global markets, barely half of those with strong assets chose to 'contend' with MNCs as predicted. The rest chose a 'cooperator' strategy, as did all firms with weak assets (in line with model predictions). For firms competing locally, the majority with strong assets followed the predicted 'contester' strategy, and the majority with weak assets chose a 'defender' strategy, again in accordance with the model. Statistical tests of the model resulted in acceptance of all hypotheses in the holdout sample and 3 out of 4 in the main sample. Two case studies are presented, showing the results of 'wrong' and 'correct' decisions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

As customer requirements change, an organization that stays in alignment with its market will form new business units or alter the market charters of existing business units. In a longitudinal study, the author traced the structural realignment that accompanied a Fortune-500 firm's entry into the Internet market. As the charter moved from a freshly created unit to an established business unit, the authors found supports for the prediction that the former organizational structure will continue to shape the identity, beliefs, and social ties of managers. The study highlights the structural, social, and cognitive factors that must be managed as corporate decision makers search for the best strategy-structure fit for an emerging market opportunity.","","","","","","","","","Abell D.F., Defining the Business: The Starting Point of Strategic Planning, (1980); Albert S., Whetten D.A., Organizational identity, Research in Organizational Behavior, pp. 262-295, (1985); Ancona D.G., Caldwell D.F., Bridging the boundary: External activity and performance in organizational teams, Administrative Science Quarterly, 37, DECEMBER, pp. 634-665, (1992); Anderson P.F., Marketing, strategic planning, and the theory of the firm, Journal of Marketing, 46, SPRING, pp. 15-26, (1982); Ashforth B.E., Johnson S.A., Which hat to wear?

Grounded in Attribute Knowledge Theory and studies on novelty seeking, this study addressed this challenge by examining the different attributes of a cruise ship that influence the decision making of cruisers and potential cruisers. Using a sample of cruisers and potential cruisers with similar socio-demographics, this study found that they perceive seven dimensions of onboard attributes, but attach different importance to some of them. These results, consistent with the theoretical prediction, provide evidence that the cruise industry should develop different marketing strategies for cruisers and potential cruisers. © 2011.","Attribute Knowledge Theory;

Donelaicio st. 73, Lithuania","Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and ""clean"" products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise - consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.","Corporate social responsibility; Green consumer; Green marketing; Lithuanian market of ecofriendly food products","","","","","","","","Alston K., Roberts J.P., Partners in new product development: SC Johnson and the alliance for environmental innovation, Corporate Environmental Strategy, 6, 2, pp. 110-128, (1999); Bakanauskas A., Organizaciju{ogonek} Vadyba: Sisteminiai Tyrimai, pp. 21-32, (2002); Baltrenas P., Kazlauskiene A., Sustainable Ecological Development Reducing Negative Effects of Road Maintenance Salts, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 15, 1, pp. 178-188, (2009); Banyte J., Brazioniene L., Gadeikiene A., Investigation of Green Consumer Profile: A Case of Lithuanian Market of Eco-Friendly Food Products, Ekonomika Ir Vadyba-Economics and Management, 15, pp. 374-383, (2010); Banyte J., Gadeikiene A., Corporate Social Responsibility as a Marketing Means in Lithuanian Business Practice, Ekonomika Ir Vadyba - Economics and Management, 13, pp. 227-238, (2008); Ceponyte Z., Ekologiski produktai: Prekybos centrai ir vartotojas, Marketingas, 3, pp. 34-39, (2006); Ciegis R., Ramanauskiene J., Startiene G., Theoretical Reasoning of the Use of Indicators and Indices for Sustainable Development Assessment, Inzinerine Ekonomika-Engineering Economics, 3, pp. 33-40, (2009); Coddington W., (1993); Cole Ch.

Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, United States","The potential of neural networks for classification problems has been established by numerous successful applications reported in the literature. One of the major assumptions used in almost all studies is the equal cost consequence of misclassification. With this assumption, minimizing the total number of misclassification errors is the sole objective in developing a neural network classifier. Often this is done simply to ease model development and the selection of classification decision points. However, it is not appropriate for many real situations such as quality assurance, direct marketing, bankruptcy prediction, and medical diagnosis where misclassification costs have unequal consequences for different categories. In this paper, we investigate the issue of unequal misclassification costs in neural network classifiers. Through an application in thyroid disease diagnosis, we find that different cost considerations have significant effects on the classification performance and that appropriate use of cost information can aid in optimal decision making. A cross-validation technique is employed to alleviate the problem of bias in the training set and to examine the robustness of neural network classifiers with regard to sampling variations and cost differences.","Classification; Medical diagnosis; Misclassification Costs; Neural Networks; Statistical Techniques","","","","","","","","Bahemuka M., Hodkinson H.M., Screening for hypothyroidism in elderly inpatients, British Medical Journal, 2, pp. 601-603, (1975); Cybenko G., Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function, Mathematical Control Signals Systems, 2, pp. 303-314, (1989); Danese M.D., Screening for mild thyroid failure at the periodic health examination, Journal of American Medical Association, 276, 4, pp. 285-292, (1996); Dos Remedios L.V., Weber P.M., Feldman R., Schurr D.A., Tsoi T.G., Detecting unsuspected thyroid dysfunction by the free thyroxine index, Archives of Internal Medicine, 140, pp. 1045-1049, (1980); Duda R.O., Hart P., Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, (1973); Fukazawa H., Sakurada T., Yoshida K., Free thyroxine estimation for the screening of hyper-and hypothyroidism in an adult population, TOHOKU Journal of Experimental Medicine, 148, pp. 411-420, (1986); Gavin L.A., The diagnostic dilemmas of hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia, Advances in Internal Medicine, 33, pp. 185-204, (1988); Gordon A.D., Classification, (1981); Hornik K., Approximation capabilities of multilayer feedforward networks, Neural Networks, 4, pp. 251-257, (1991); Hornik K., Stinchcombe M., White H., Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, 2, pp. 359-366, (1989); Hung M.S., Hu M.Y., Patuwo B.E., Shanker M., Estimating posterior probabilities in classification problems with neural networks, International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Organizations, 1, pp. 49-60, (1996); Kohers G., Rakes T.R., Rees L.P., The use of neural networks and combined forecasts in the prediction of portfolio returns with different penalty costs, Proceedings of the 1994 Annual Meeting of the Decision Sciences Institute, pp. 1331-1333, (1994); Kohers G., Rakes T.R., Rees L.P., Predicting weekly portfolio returns with the use of composite models: A comparison of neural networks and traditional composite models, Proceedings of the 1996 Annual Meeting of the Decision Sciences Institute, pp. 1132-1134, (1996); Nolan J.P., Tarsa N.J., Dibenedetto G., Case-finding for unsuspected thyroid disease: Costs and health benefits, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 83, pp. 346-355, (1985); Papoulix A., Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes, (1965); Patuwo B.E., Hu M.Y., Hung M.S., Two-group classification using neural networks, Decision Sciences, 24, 4, pp. 825-845, (1993); Philipoom P.R., Wiegmann L., Rees L.P., Cost-based due-date assignment with the use of classical and neural network approaches, Naval Research Logistics, 44, 1, pp. 21-46, (1997); Postellon D.C., Abdallah A., Congenital hypothyroidism: Diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, Comprehensive Therapy, 12, pp. 67-71, (1986); Press S.J., Wilson S., Choosing between logistic regression and discriminant analysis, American Statistical Association, 73, pp. 699-705, (1978); Quinlan J., Simplifying decision trees, International Journal of Man-machine Studies, 27, pp. 221-234, (1987); Richard M.D., Lippmann R.P., Neural network classifiers estimate basyesian a posterior probabilities, Neural Computation, 3, pp. 461-483, (1991); Riedmiller M., Braun H., A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning: The Rprop algorithm, Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Networks, (1993); Rumelhart D.E., Hinton G.E., Williams R.J., Learning internal representations by error propagation, Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition, (1986); Salchengerger L.M., Cinar E.M., Lash N.A., Neural networks: A new tool for predicting thrift failures, Decision Sciences, 23, 4, pp. 899-916, (1992); Tunbridge W.M., Brewis M., French J.M., The spectrum of thyroid disease in a community: The Wickham survey, Clinical Endocrinology, 7, pp. 481-493, (1977); Weiss S.M., Kulilowski C.A., Computer Systems That Learn, (1991); White G.H., Walmsley R.N., Can the initial assessment of thyroid function be improved?, Lancet, 2, pp. 933-935, (1978); Wilke T.J., Estimation of free thyroid hormone concentrations in the clinical laboratory, Clinical Chemistry, 32, pp. 585-592, (1986); Wong E.T., Steffes M.W., A fundamental approach to the diagnosis of diseases of the thyroid gland, Clinical Laboratory Medicine, 4, pp. 655-670, (1984)","V.L.

K1S 5B6, Canada","The dominant approach in brand-extension research has focused on the role of fit in the extension evaluation process. Overemphasis on fit has resulted in research designs that involve singular evaluation of the extension without considering how competing brands in the target category might affect the evaluation of brand extensions. Singular evaluations are known to result in brand positivity effects; that is, brand extensions are evaluated more favorably than is warranted. This research finds that singular evaluations do indeed lead to brand positivity effects. However, brand positivity effects are mitigated when respondents were provided with competitive information along with target-category structure and comparative/non-comparative brand positioning statements. Results also suggest that parent brand-extension fit, though an important determinant of an extension's assessment, plays a less critical role in a comparative evaluation context when an extension's brand strength is accounted for in relation to its competition in the target category. Therefore, the findings stress the importance of both competition and parent-brand fit in making informed positioning decisions and more realistic predictions of extension success. The research demonstrates when, how and to what extent comparative evaluations result in lower extension ratings and provides managerial strategies to introduce an extension effectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This research investigates choice complexity (i.e., number of alternatives, number of attributes, and utility similarity between the most attractive alternatives) and individual differences in decision time as key factors that affect the predictive performance of models based on choice experiments, both within and between complexity conditions. The results show that complexity and individual decision time not only affect the error in consumer choice models but also consumers' decision strategy and systematic utilities. The authors introduce a complexity-adjusted mixed logit (CAM logit) model to capture the various influences of complexity in choice experiment-based models. They illustrate the consequences of complexity on choice behavior with market share predictions of the CAM logit model for different complexity conditions. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Choice complexity;
