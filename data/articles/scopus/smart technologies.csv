One of these is Big Data Analytics (BDA), which enables a firm to improve its marketing practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate how integrating big data technology improves the marketing strategies of Indian FMCG companies operating in a dynamic and highly competitive market distinguished by its size and diversity, constantly changing consumer behaviour, and Marketing 4.0 trends. This study adopts a systematic approach to coding an interview with seasoned Indian FMCG professionals to explain the capabilities of Big Data in molding marketing practices. A framework is constructed based on the same. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed to visualize its applicability in business. Further, the Resource-based View (RBV) theory is discussed for describing the insights into the role and adoption of Big Data by Indian FMCG firms for enhancing performance and achieving competitiveness, along with demonstrating its benefits for decision-making, customer loyalty and internal capability assessment. © 2024 The Author(s)","Big data analytics; Digital marketing; FMCG; Marketing 4.0; Resource based view","","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Sarker S., Chiang R.H., Big Data research in information systems: Toward an inclusive research agenda, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17, 2, (2016); Acciarini C., Cappa F., Boccardelli P., Oriani R., How can organizations leverage big data to innovate their business models?

Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review guided the formulation of this study, followed by face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with hotel managers. A total of 17 prepared questions were finalized after examination by two expert academicians. The responses were analyzed using qualitative research methodology and the results were weighted using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Findings: Interviews with sustainability and operational managers yielded insights into environmentally friendly practices and strategies such as reducing energy and water consumption, waste and chemical reduction, supporting local entrepreneurs and adopting smart technologies. These factors are crucial in eco-friendly hotels. According to the SWARA analysis, 'reducing energy consumption' is the most effective criterion. Research limitations/implications: This study offers insights into green and smart hotel management by focusing on the perspectives of hotel managers with a small sample. In future studies, research with larger samples on customer perspectives and the effect of hotel selection is recommended. Practical implications: This study offers insights to hotel managers on energy conservation and customer satisfaction enhancement through green and technological applications. These technological applications can improve hotel service quality and provide personalized experiences, fostering customer loyalty. Originality/value: This pioneering study focuses on the intersection of green and smart practices in hospitality. By intertwining the often separately discussed concepts of “green” and “smart,” this study presents a novel approach to the sustainability practices in the hospitality industry, holding a key position, especially in Turkey. Implementing these concepts can yield environmental and economic benefits, offering invaluable insights to hotel managers and policymakers into integrating smart technologies with sustainability. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Green hotel; Multi-criteria decision-making methods; Qualitative research; Smart hotel; Sustainable marketing","","","","","","","","Abdou A.H., Hassan T.H., El Dief M.M., A description of green hotel practices and their role in achieving sustainable development, Sustainability, 12, 22, (2020); Abdullah L., Fuzzy multi criteria decision making and its applications: a brief review of category, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 97, pp. 131-136, (2013); Agag G., Colmekcioglu N., Understanding guests' behavior to visit green hotels: the role of ethical ideology and religiosity, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 91, (2020); Akan H., Deneysel Çalışmalarda Yanlılık Kaynakları, Sorunları ve Önlemler: Iç Geçerlilik, Kanıt Düzeyindeki Hemşirelik Araştırmalarında Kalite:Yöntem Ve Raporlama, pp. 8-10, (2018); Atay L., Yalcinkaya P., Bahar F., İstanbul'daki akıllı otel uygulamalarının değerlendirilmesi, MANAS Sosyal Araştırmalar Dergisi, 8, 1, pp. 667-678, (2019); Auliandri T.A., Angraeny R., The implementation of green hotel management standard in Majapahit Hotel Indonesia, International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 9, 3, pp. 45-62, (2017); Babaei Y., Fani M., The effect of green human resource management on environmental citizenship behavior and environmentally-friendly behaviors of hotel staff, Tourism Management, 16, 56, pp. 211-249, (2022); Baran T., Popescu C., Generation Z attitudes toward green marketing: a cross country and gender analysis, pp. 6-9, (2016); Buhalis D., Wagner R., E-destinations: global best practice in tourism technologies and applications, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism, pp. 119-130, (2013); Buhalis D., Harwood T., Bogicevic V., Viglia G., Beldona S., Hofacker C., Technological disruptions in services: lessons from tourism and hospitality, Journal of Service Management, 30, 4, pp. 484-506, (2019); Camillo A., Presenza A., Di Virgilio F., An analysis of the characteristics and dynamic development of an emergent sustainable hotel business model in Italy: ‘Albergo Diffuso (Diffused Hotel)’, Handbook of Research on Global Hospitality and Tourism Management, (2015); Cetin H., Akgun A., Yeşil bilişim teknolojileri bağlamında sanallaştırılmış ve Klasik sistemlerin karşılaştırılması, Journal of Alanya Faculty of Business/Alanya İşletme Fakültesi Dergisi, 7, 2, pp. 131-142, (2015); Chan C.S., Peters M., Pikkemaat B., Investigating visitors' perception of smart city dimensions for city branding in Hong Kong, International Journal of Tourism Cities, 5, 4, pp. 620-638, (2019); Chen E.G., Kuo W.G., Hsiao M.L., Green of marketing and research the green expense behavior relations the environmental protection textile: for example Taipei city, Journal of the Hwa Gang Textile, 11, 2, pp. 117-131, (2004); Chung K.C., Green marketing orientation: achieving sustainable development in green hotel management, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 29, 6, pp. 722-738, (2020); Cilingir F., Erkilic E., Yeşil yıldızlı otel işletmelerinin yeşil yönetim ve uygulamaları üzerine bir inceleme: Muğla örneği, Journal of Tourism Intelligence and Smartness, 4, 2, pp. 218-238, (2021); Cohen J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Cramer J., Environmental management: from fit to ‘stretch’, Business Strategy and the Environment, 7, 3, pp. 162-172, (1998); Creswell J.W., Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Method Approaches, (2009); Damar M., Goksen Y., Yeşil bilişim yaklaşımıyla kullanıcı ve kurum odaklı Enerji yönetim sistemi, Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi Mühendislik Fakültesi Fen ve Mühendislik Dergisi, 20, 58, pp. 259-274, (2018); Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research, (2011); Dodds R., Holmes M., Is there a benefit from being green.

Organizations that formerly concentrated on transactional sales thus confront a new challenge associated with managing service usage—retention and extracting value from investments in smart technology. This study combines a marketing and an information systems perspective in a field study conducted jointly with a large European car manufacturer. Understanding the renewal decision for IT-based service contracts requires knowledge from both disciplines. The paper shows that combining behavioral predictor variables stemming from marketing research and technology-related perceptual variables stemming from technology acceptance research increases the explanatory power and prediction accuracy of forecasting models for customer renewal decisions. Specifically, the authors show that perceptions of usefulness become more important the longer customers use IT-based services and the more services they use within the service contract. © 2017","Contract renewal; Customer churn; Free trial; IT-based service; Retention; Smart services","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., Nature and operation of attitudes, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 27-58, (2001); Albarracin D., Wallace H.M., Glasman L.R., Survival and change of attitudes and other social judgments: A model of judgment activation and comparison, Advances in experimental social psychology, 36, pp. 251-315, (2004); Babin B.J., Darden W.R., Griffin M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 4, pp. 644-656, (1994); Baron S., Patterson A., Harris K., Beyond technology acceptance: Understanding consumer practice, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 17, 2, pp. 111-135, (2006); Bart I., Venkatesh S., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

Meanwhile, online privacy protection has attracted rich attention in both academia and practice. Mobile software functions require the authorization of user information. The misuse of private data poses a great threat to users’ privacy safety. It is a difficult task for developers to mitigate users′ concerns and sensitivity to various private data and improve their application performance based on access to the application permission. Based on the “ minimum authority principle,” this paper explores the impact of permission sensitivity and rationality on software performance. The sample data includes 33,772 records of 5,304 software applications in the Xiaomi app store from January 2018 to December 2019. Firstly, according to whether sensitive information of users is involved, permissions are divided into dangerous and normal groups. Based on the permission lists, “0-1” vectors of various permissions are generated. Secondly, four different permission factors are calculated by the spatial distance algorithm to quantify rationality and sensitivity. Finally, this paper empirically explores the impact of permission factors on application ranking based on the panel data fixed effect regression model, which takes application ranking as the decision result of privacy response behavior. Based on the privacy concern theory, this paper links permission invocation with application performance, proving the negative impact of improper permission mechanisms on application performance. The first section introduces the generation method for the four permission factors. The sensitivity indicator refers to whether the permission requires access to users’ private information or illegally shares or sends personal information to others. According to the classification system of the Android Developer Platform, we can quickly get the dummy variables for permission sensitivity. The reasonability indicator refers to whether the type and number of permissions requested by applications match their functional complexity and category average level. The average permission vector for every category is defined as an estimation of “ the least privilege” that best matches the application function. Then, we use the distance from the “ least privilege vector” to denote the irrationality degree. We can obtain four different permission factors by intersecting these two indicators. Mobile applications with too few normal permissions may have functional defects, while those with too many dangerous permissions may cause users′ privacy concerns. The rationality and sensitivity of permissions jointly affect users′ download decisions and application performance. The second part illustrates the influence mechanism of the four permission factors on application ranking. Dangerous and normal permissions have different impacts on mobile application rankings. Considering the particularity of ranking data, this study uses a rologit regression model combined with lag processing and fixed effect to eliminate the impact of other confounding variables. The results show that permission abuse will lower the ranking of applications in this category. The higher the abuse degree, the lower the ranking. With the same degree of rationality, highly sensitive permissions will increase users′ concerns about privacy and security risks. The impact of insufficient permission application cannot be generalized. Insufficient dangerous permission has a positive impact on ranking; however, insufficient normal permission has no significant impact on app ranking. In the third part, the additional model discusses the regulatory effect of apps’ functional descriptions on the influence mechanism. Software with rich functions usually needs to request more permissions. Users enjoy a high sense of self-anonymity in applications with simplified functions, which will reduce their privacy risk concerns. The consequences of security vulnerabilities will be more severe for complex software. Small changes in permissions may drastically affect the user′s privacy risk estimation and the app ranking. In this case, labelling dangerous permissions lower than the average level and normal permissions higher than the average level both have a significant impact on the application ranking. In general, application permission data is closely related to its market performance. While designing software, developers should fully consider the user′s privacy perception level and reduce the use of dangerous permission as much as possible. Without affecting the core functions of the application, a reasonable balance between normal permissions and dangerous permissions can effectively improve the application ranking and marketing performance. Analyzing the performance impact factors and permission evolution process is of great significance to improve app scores and word of mouth. © (2023), (Zhejiang University).

To this end, the article provides commentary and structures to outline the impact of ExC and to elaborate the definition and reach of ExC. The logic of ExC culminates in a theory of cognitive states comprising of three potential decision states: endogenous cognition, symbiotic cognition and surrogate cognition.

Objectives: The paper aims to determine opportunities for further development of digital promotion of cultural attractions by identifying the potential of websites, online marketing tools and smart technologies implemented by tourism attraction decision-makers. Methods/Approach: Qualitative and qualitative research methods were used as longitudinal research and structured interviews with decision-makers of the tourist destination. Results: Positive developments in implementing the digital promotion of cultural heritage during and after the pandemic are evident, but not fast enough considering the accelerated development of new smart technologies. At the same time, decision-makers recognise the importance of the digital promotion of cultural heritage. However, they are still unfamiliar with the possibilities of smart technology to affirm the digital promotion of cultural heritage. Conclusions: The paper points to the conclusion of how the advantages and potentials of developing a smart culture in destinations, recognised as a strategic policy of development, are implemented in the digital marketing of heritage sites.  © 2023 Tamara Floričić et al., published by Sciendo.","Heritage buildings;
