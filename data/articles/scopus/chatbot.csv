This study investigates how anthropomorphic chatbots influence customer engagement and emotional responses following social exclusion, and further impact their commercial decisions. Through a between-subject experiment involving 609 participants, we explored the effects of anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) chatbots across three social exclusion conditions (ignored, rejected, and control). Our findings reveal that anthropomorphic chatbots significantly enhance purchase intention, relational investment, and organizational trust, mediated by increased senses of belonging and control and enhanced parasocial interactions. This research enriches the marketing literature by applying the need-threat model and illuminating the psychological mechanisms underlying customer responses. The practical implications for marketing and public relations professionals include strategies for optimizing brand-consumer interactions through the strategic use of anthropomorphic chatbots. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","anthropomorphism; Chatbot; commercial decisions; need-threat model; social exclusion","","","","","","","","Araujo T., Living up to the chatbot hype: The influence of anthropomorphic design cues and communicative agency framing on conversational agent and company perceptions, Computers in Human Behavior, 85, pp. 183-189, (2018); Baumeister R.F., Leary M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Chen J., Guo F., Ren Z., Li M., Ham J., Effects of anthropomorphic design cues of chatbots on users’ perception and visual behaviors, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, pp. 1-19, (2023); Chen K.-J., Lin J.-S., Choi J.H., Hahm J.M., Would you be my friend? an examination of global marketers’ brand personification strategies in social media, Journal of Interactive Advertising, 15, 2, pp. 97-110, (2015); Chen R.P., Wan E.W., Levy E., The effect of social exclusion on consumer preference for anthropomorphized brands, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 27, 1, pp. 23-34, (2017); Cheng Y., Jiang H., Customer–brand relationship in the era of artificial intelligence: Understanding the role of chatbot marketing efforts, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 31, 2, pp. 252-264, (2022); Cheng X., Zhang X., Cohen J., Mou J., Human vs. AI: Understanding the impact of anthropomorphism on consumer response to chatbots from the perspective of trust and relationship norms, Information Processing & Management, 59, 3, (2022); Corritore C.L., Kracher B., Wiedenbeck S., On-line trust: Concepts, evolving themes, a model, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 58, 6, pp. 737-758, (2003); De Gennaro M., Krumhuber E.G., Lucas G., Effectiveness of an empathic chatbot in combating adverse effects of social exclusion on mood, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, (2019); DeWall C.N., Maner J.K., Rouby D.A., Social exclusion and early-stage interpersonal perception: Selective attention to signs of acceptance, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 96, 4, pp. 729-741, (2009); The Chatbots Report (2018): Reshaping Online Experiences, (2018); Epley N., Waytz A., Cacioppo J.T., On seeing human: A three-factor theory of anthropomorphism, Psychological Review, 114, 4, pp. 864-886, (2007); Galloway C., Swiatek L., Public relations and artificial intelligence: It’s not (just) about robots, Public Relations Review, 44, 5, pp. 734-740, (2018); Go E., Sundar S.S., Humanizing chatbots: The effects of visual, identity and conversational cues on humanness perceptions, Computers in Human Behavior, 97, pp. 304-316, (2019); Guthrie S.E., Faces in the clouds: A new theory of religion, (1995); Han M.C., The impact of anthropomorphism on consumers’ purchase decision in chatbot commerce, Journal of Internet Commerce, 20, 1, pp. 46-65, (2021); Han J., Wang D., Yang Z., Acting like an interpersonal relationship: Cobrand anthropomorphism increases product evaluation and purchase intention, Journal of Business Research, 167, (2023); Hopp T., Gangadharbatla H., Novelty effects in augmented reality advertising environments: The influence of exposure time and self-efficacy, Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising, 37, 2, pp. 113-130, (2016); Horton D., Wohl R.R., Mass communication and para-social interaction: observations on intimacy at a distance, Psychiatry, 19, 3, pp. 215-229, (1956); Jiang H., Cheng Y., Yang J., Gao S., AI-powered chatbot communication with customers: Dialogic interactions, satisfaction, engagement, and customer behavior, Computers in Human Behavior, 134, (2022); Jin S.A.A., Parasocial interaction with an avatar in second life: A typology of the self and an empirical test of the mediating role of social presence, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 19, 4, pp. 331-340, (2010); Kaplan A.M., Haenlein M., Users of the world, unite!

ChatGPT provides information back to users who populate questions in a clear and easy to understand structure. This technology can be used for different purposes, including writing code, creating business proposals, writing stories and answering complex questions. Because this technology is considered a breakthrough in terms of its ability to process natural language, it stands to reason that it could have future effects on the fundamental digital marketing tactic known as search engine optimisation (SEO), a process by which websites are developed and updated with the goal of increasing natural ranking, traffic and customers from search engines like Google and Bing. For the past 20 years, people have turned to search engines for information, news articles, images, videos and answers to questions both mundane and complex. This technological advance with chatbots could indicate a significant general shift for marketers, specifically related to web searches and how marketers think about SEO. In fact, Microsoft’s decision to invest in ChatGPT and include it within their search engine, Bing, has already created waves in the search engine ecosystems. In this paper, ChatGPT will be examined, its capabilities and how they could affect search marketing and SEO. © Henry Stewart Publications.","chat bots; ChatGPT; digital marketing; search engine marketing; search engine optimisation; search marketing; SEO","","","","","","","","Ruby D., ChatGPT Statistics for 2023: Comprehensive Facts and Data, (2023); Tamkin A., Ganguli D., How Large Language Models Will Transform Science, Society, and AI, (2021); Cheng M., Microsoft Spent over a Decade on the New Bing.Then ChatGPT Happened, Quartz, (2023); Pichai S., An Important Next Step on Our AI Journey, (2023); How Google’s Knowledge Graph Works; Dall-E2, OpenAI; Dhariwal P., Jun H., Payne C., Kim J.W., Radford A., Sutskever I., Jukebox: A Generative Model for Music, (2020); Radford A., Kim J.W., Hallacy C., Ramesh A., Goh G., Agarwal S., Sastry G., Askell A., Mishkin P., Clark J., Krueger G., Sutskever I., Learning Transferable Visual Models from Natural Language Supervision, Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning [Virtual] 2021, PMLR, 139, pp. 8748-8763, (2021); Introducing Whisper, OpenAI; Wiggers K., OpenAI Open-Sources Whisper, a Multilingual Speech Recognition System, TechCrunch, (2022); Model Index for Researchers, OpenAI; Open AI, ChatGPT Blog, OpenAI, (2022); Stiennon N., Ouyang L., Wu J., Ziegler D., Lowe R., Voss C., Radford A., Amodei D., Christiano P.

However, many existing AI chatbots have yet to meet the expectations of solo travelers, especially when they demand more personalized information to assist in travel decision-making. Based on complexity theory, this research examines the factors that stimulate solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, particularly covering the three main aspects of marketing efforts, communication quality, and affective characteristics. Drawing from a sample of 281 solo travelers, partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used to examine the proposed relationships. The PLS-SEM results illustrate that interaction, entertainment, trendiness, communication competence, and satisfaction have significant direct effects on purchase intentions. The fsQCA results further revealed four solutions exhibiting high purchase intentions among solo travelers. Different core, peripheral, and necessary causal conditions in each configuration path were identified. The findings enrich the AI chatbot literature by examining the underlying reasons why solo travelers react differently to this emerging technology and produce practical recommendations for designing AI chatbot systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","AI chatbot; fsQCA; PLS-SEM; Purchase intentions; Solo travelers; Tourism","","","","","","","","Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., Chatbots: History, technology, and applications, Machine Learning with Applications, 2, pp. 1-18, (2020); Aguilera-Caracuel J., Fedriani E.M., Delgado-Marquez B.L., Institutional distance among country influences and environmental performance standardization in multinational enterprises, Journal of Business Research, 67, 11, pp. 2385-2392, (2014); Alonso-Vazquez M., Yang E.C.L., Pages Vidal M.D.M., Khoo C., Going solo during the pandemic: A generational segmentation of solo female travellers, Current Issues in Tourism, pp. 1-15, (2023); Azali M., Kamal Basha N., Chang Y.S., Lim X.J., Cheah J.H., Why not travel to Malaysia?

Moreover, they can collect data in a digital landscape that is increasingly sensitive to privacy. The objective of this study was to help strategic marketing decision-makers better understand how and where chatbots can be used effectively to gather consumer data. We analyse whether consumers’ privacy concerns influence their adoption. Furthermore, we invest if privacy concerns, and subsequently information disclosure, are significantly influenced by the chatbot’s location. In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer’s website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots. Both relationships are sequentially mediated via higher privacy concerns and less comfort with information disclosure. Companies therefore need to consider where to deploy their chatbots.

Three dimensions of trust were tested in relation to user self-disclosure in order to better understand the consumer-chatbot experience in banking. The methodology selected for this research study followed a conclusive, pre-experimental, two-group one-shot case study research design which made use of a non-probability snowballing sampling technique. Privacy concerns were found to have a significantly negative relationship with user self-disclosure in both treatment groups. Respondents exposed to their preferred banking brand experienced lower user self-disclosure and brand trust than those exposed to a fictitious banking brand within the South African context. It is recommended that companies using chatbots focus on easing privacy concerns and build foundations of trust. The gains that chatbots have made in the form of increased productivity and quality of customer service rely on relationships with users who need to disclose personal information. Through this study, we concluded that, despite its power to influence decision-making, the power of a brand is not enough for consumers to considerably increase self-disclosure. Rather, a bridge of trust (through education, communication and product development) is needed that encompasses all three elements of trust, which are brand trust, cognitive trust and emotional trust. Limited research exists on the relationship between financial services marketing and chatbot adoption. Thus, this study addressed a theoretical gap, by adding brand trust to existing studies on cognitive and emotional trust regarding user self-disclosure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Chatbots; Conversational commerce; Digital privacy; Internet banking; Online brand trust; User self-disclosure","","","","","","","","Adam M., Wessel M., Benlian A., AI-based chatbots in customer service and their effects on user compliance, Electronic Markets, 31, 2, pp. 427-445, (2021); Affrin K.S., Mohan T., Goh Y., Influence of consumers’ perceived risk on consumers’ online purchase intention, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing., 12, 3, pp. 309-327, (2018); Aguidissou O.C., Shambare R., Rugimbana R., Internet banking adoption in South Africa: The mediating role of consumer readiness, Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies., 9, 5, pp. 6-17, (2017); Aguirre E., Roggeveen A.L., Grewal D., Wetzels M., The personalization-privacy paradox: Implications for new media, Journal of Consumer Marketing., 33, 2, pp. 98-110, (2015); Conversational Assistants: Investigating Privacy Concerns, Trust, and Self-Disclosure, Proceedings from the Thirty Eighth International Conference on Information Systems. 10–13 December, (2017); Al-Jabri I.M., The intention to use mobile banking: Further evidence from Saudi Arabia, South African Journal of Business Management., 46, 1, pp. 23-34, (2015); Andersson P., Mattsson L.G., Service innovations enabled by the “Internet of Things, IMP Journal, 9, 1, pp. 85-106, (2015); Kearney A.T., (2013); Awad N.F., Krishnan M.S., The personalization privacy paradox: An empirical evaluation of information transparency and the willingness to be profiled online for personalization, MIS Quarterly, 30, 1, pp. 13-28, (2006); Baumer D., Earp J.B., Innovative web use to learn about consumer behavior and online privacy, Communications of the ACM, 46, 4, pp. 81-83, (2003); Belen Saglam R., Nurse J.R., Hodges D., Privacy concerns in Chatbot interactions: When to trust and when to worry, International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 391-399, (2021); Benbasat I., Komiak S.Y., Understanding customer trust in agent-mediated electronic commerce, web-mediated electronic commerce, and traditional commerce, Information Technology and Management, 5, 1-2, pp. 181-207, (2004); Benbasat I., Komiak S.Y., The effects of personalization and familiarity on trust and adoption of recommendation agents, MIS Quarterly, 30, 4, pp. 941-960, (2006); Brandtzaegfolstad P.B.A., Why People Use Chatbots.

While acknowledging the capabilities of AI chatbots to handle customer interactions and improve response times, we critically examine several challenges they present, including interoperability challenges, data protection concerns, and biased output. This research presents a novel framework for managers to assess a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM), which has been adapted to account for the critical challenges associated with the emerging technology. Incorporating four factors—subjective norms, compatibility, facilitating conditions, and trust—allows for a more holistic assessment of a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology. The framework, together with a readiness assessment tool, provides a comprehensive mechanism for managerial decision-making, focusing on the adoption of AI chatbots in customer service, sales, and marketing business functions. In exploring these factors, our article explores the managerial implications of integrating AI chatbots into business processes, ensuring an informed and holistic approach to technology adoption. © 2024 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Artificial intelligence;

Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Errors; Fuzzy neural networks; Marketing; Product development; Accurate prediction; Business product development; Business products; Chatbots; Increasing production; Information loss; Marketing information; Neural network model; Performance; Product information; Neural network models","","","","","Guangxi 14th Five-Year Education Science Planning Project, (,2021A033, 2021ZJY1607, 2021ZJY1612, 2022ZJY1699.2022, 2022ZJY354); Guangxi Graduate Education, (JGY2022122); Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China, (21BGL129); Rural Agriculture, Culture and Tourism for Rural Revitalization, (22FGL024); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710038); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, (2020AC19034); Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents","Funding text 1: This work was sponsored by the following funds: ""Research on Multidimensional Identification and Long-term Governance Mechanism of Relative Poverty of Farming Households in Border Areas"" (Grant No. 20BGL247), General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China under the ""Two Mountains"" Theory, General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21BGL129); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation：A study on the mechanism of physician engagement behaviour in online medical communities from the perspective of network effects (No.2022M710038).

In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Galaz V., Centeno M.

Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3). Originality/value: Anthropomorphizing AI has undeniable relevance in the contemporary marketing landscape, such as humanoid robotics and emotion AI algorithms. Despite of anthropomorphism's significance and relevance, the downstream impact of anthropomorphism remains unfortunately underexplored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence (AI); Political ideology; Psychological closeness; Psychological risk attachment; Risk aversion","","","","","","","","Abdulquadri A., Mogaji E., Kieu T.A., Nguyen N.P., Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Acikgoz F., Vega R.P., The role of privacy cynicism in consumer habits with voice assistants: a Technology Acceptance Model perspective, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, pp. 1-15, (2022); Aggarwal P., McGill A.L., Is that car smiling at me?

In particular, to capture the technical features of chatbots, we identify three types of chatbot affordances (i.e., automatability, personalization, and availability) and three types of chatbot disaffordances (i.e., limited understanding, lack of emotion, and null decision-making). We show that these types of chatbot affordances and disaffordances are related to chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots, which in turn can affect employees' attitudes toward chatbots. We conducted an empirical study via an online survey and collected data from 228 B2B marketing employees. While automatability and personalization enhance chatbot effectiveness, null decision-making increases discomfort with using chatbots. Further, chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots both influence employees' attitudes toward chatbots. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Affordance; B2B marketing; Chatbot; Disaffordance; Discomfort; Effectiveness","","","","","","West Texas A and M University, WTAMU","This study is supported by the internal grant from West Texas A & M University .
