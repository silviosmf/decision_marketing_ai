Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is able to increase the classification accuracy of several existing works based on RNN models for sentiment analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; BiLSTM; FastText; GRU; LSTM; Natural language processing;

Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Online reviews; Review synthesis; Wine reviews","","","","","","2020 Northeast; Machine Learning, and Business Analytics","We thank the Editor, Area Editor, and two anonymous IJRM reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Having access to users’ contributions to social sites and gaining insights into the consumers’ needs is of the utmost importance for marketing decision making in general, and to advertisement recommendation in particular. By analyzing this information, advertisement recommendation systems can attain a better understanding of the users’ interests and preferences, thus allowing these solutions to provide more precise ad suggestions. However, in addition to the already complex challenges that hamper the performance of recommender systems (i.e., data sparsity, cold-start, diversity, accuracy and scalability), new issues that should be considered have also emerged from the need to deal with heterogeneous data gathered from disparate sources. The technologies surrounding Linked Data and the Semantic Web have proved effective for knowledge management and data integration. In this work, an ontology-based advertisement recommendation system that leverages the data produced by users in social networking sites is proposed, and this approach is substantiated by a shared ontology model with which to represent both users’ profiles and the content of advertisements. Both users and advertisement are represented by means of vectors generated using natural language processing techniques, which collect ontological entities from textual content. The ad recommender framework has been extensively validated in a simulated environment, obtaining an aggregated f-measure of 79.2% and a Mean Average Precision at 3 (MAP@3) of 85.6%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising; Knowledge-based systems; Natural language processing; Recommender systems; Social network services","Data integration; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Social networking (online); Heterogeneous data; Marketing decision; NAtural language processing; Performance of recommender systems; Simulated environment; Social applications; Social network services; Social networking sites; Recommender systems","","","","","FEDER/ERDF, (TIN2016-76323-R); Seneca Foundation-the Regional Agency for Science and Technology of Murcia, (20963/PI/18); Spanish National Research Agency; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","This work has been partially supported by the Spanish National Research Agency (AEI) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER/ERDF) through project KBS4FIA ( TIN2016-76323-R ), and Seneca Foundation-the Regional Agency for Science and Technology of Murcia (Spain)- through project 20963/PI/18 .","Aggarwal C.C., An introduction to recommender systems, Recommender systems, pp. 1-28, (2016); Aguilar J., Valdiviezo-Diaz P., Riofrio G., A general framework for intelligent recommender systems, Applied Computing and Informatics, 13, 2, pp. 147-160, (2017); Altinel B., Ganiz M.C., Semantic text classification: A survey of past and recent advances, Information Processing & Management, 54, 6, pp. 1129-1153, (2018); (2013); Bagherifard K., Rahmani M., Nilashi M., Rafe V., Performance improvement for recommender systems using ontology, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 8, pp. 1772-1792, (2017); Bai X., Wang M., Lee I., Yang Z., Kong X., Xia F., Scientific paper recommendation: A survey, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 9324-9339, (2019); Batmaz Z., Yurekli A., Bilge A., Kaleli C., A review on deep learning for recommender systems: Challenges and remedies, Artificial Intelligence Review, 52, 1, pp. 1-37, (2019); Belem F.M., Heringer A.G., Almeida J.M., Goncalves M.A., Exploiting syntactic and neighbourhood attributes to address cold start in tag recommendation, Information Processing & Management, 56, 3, pp. 771-790, (2019); Bizer C., Heath T., Berners-Lee T., Linked data - The story so far, International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems, 5, 3, pp. 1-22, (2009); Boratto L., Carta S., Fenu G., Saia R., Semantics-aware content-based recommender systems: Design and architecture guidelines, Neurocomputing, 254, pp. 79-85, (2017); Calegari S., Pasi G., Personal ontologies: Generation of user profiles based on the YAGO ontology, Information Processing & Management, 49, 3, pp. 640-658, (2013); Cano E., Morisio M., Hybrid recommender systems: A systematic literature review, Intelligent Data Analysis, 21, 6, pp. 1487-1524, (2017); Carrer-Neto W., Hernandez-Alcaraz M.L., Valencia-Garcia R., Garcia-Sanchez F., Social knowledge-based recommender system.

This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating the “doubling” procedure to deal with percentile data. Practical implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of art collectors that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating a non-traditional application of correspondence analysis using the “doubling” procedure. Buyer behavior in the fine art market is not exhaustively studied. By understanding the personality traits of consumers in the art market, sales forces can better provide assistance and product to consumers. Further, understanding the personalities of consumers is better for art retail spaces to better serve consumers. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates a unique mixed methods approach to analyzing unstructured qualitative data. It shows how text data can be used to identify measurable market segments for which targeted strategies can be developed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Art collectors; Artificial intelligence; Automated text analysis; Correspondence analysis; Psychographic consumer segmentation; Psychographic segmentation; Quantitative analysis of qualitative data","","","","","","","","Amabile T.M., Phillips E.D., Collins M.A., Creativity by contract: social influences on the creativity of professional fine artists, Annual Meeting of the American Psychological Association, (1993); Arnould E.J., Price L., Moisio R., Making contexts matter: Selecting research contexts for theoretical insights, Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, pp. 106-125, (2006); Belk R., Collecting as luxury consumption: effects on individuals and households, Journal of Economic Psychology, 16, 3, pp. 477-490, (1995); Bendixen M.T., Correspondence Analysis, (1991); Bourdieu P., The forms of capital, The Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 241-258, (1986); Chamorro-Premuzic T., Reimers S., Hsu A., Ahmetoglu G., Who art thou?

The authors use the output of topic models at the brand level to evaluate similarities between brands and to identify potential cobrand partners. In addition to using average topic probabilities to assess brands’ relationships to each other, they incorporate a differential language analysis framework, which implements scientific inference with multi-test-corrected hypothesis testing, to evaluate positive and negative topic correlates of brand names. The authors highlight the various applications of these approaches in decision making for brand management, including the assessment of brand positioning and future cobranding partnerships, design of marketing communication, identification of new product introductions, and identification of potential negative brand associations that can pose a threat to a brand's image. Moreover, they introduce a new metric, “temporal topic variability,” that can serve as an early warning of future changes in consumer preference. The authors evaluate social media analytic contributions against offline survey data. They demonstrate their approach with a sample of 193 brands, representing a broad set of categories, and discuss its implications. © American Marketing Association 2022.","brand engagement; brand positioning; brand strategy; branding‌; latent Dirichlet allocation; natural language processing; social media; topic modeling","","","","","","","","Akiva N., Greitzer E., Krichman Y., Schler J., (2008); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Deriving the Pricing Power of Product Features by Mining Consumer Reviews, Management Science, 57, 8, pp. 1485-1509, (2011); Baum C.F., Schaffer M.E., Stillman S., Instrumental Variables and GMM: Estimation and Testing, The Stata Journal: Promoting Communications on Statistics and Stata, 3, 1, pp. 1-31, (2003); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W.W., Netzer O., Schweidel D.A., Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight, Journal of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 4-5, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Borah A., Tellis G.J., Halo (Spillover) Effects in Social media: Do Product Recalls of One Brand Hurt or Help Rival Brands?, Journal of Marketing Research, 53, 2, pp. 143-160, (2016); Buschken J., Allenby G.M., Sentence-Based Text Analysis for Customer Reviews, Marketing Science, 35, 6, pp. 953-975, (2016); Cho Y.-J., Fu P.-W., Wu C.-C., Popular Research Topics in Marketing Journals, 1995–2014, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 40, pp. 52-72, (2017); Chung C., Pennebaker J.W., The Psychological Functions of Function Words, Social Communication, pp. 343-359, (2007); Cronbach L.J., Meehl P.E., Construct Validity in Psychological Tests, Psychological Bulletin, 52, 4, pp. 281-302, (1955); Culotta A., Cutler J., Mining Brand Perceptions from Twitter Social Networks, Marketing Science, 35, 3, pp. 343-362, (2016); Dave K., Lawrence S., Pennock D.M., (2003); Feldman R., Sanger J., The Text Mining Handbook: Advanced Approaches in Analyzing Unstructured Data, (2007); Feldman Barrett L., Russell J.A., Independence and Bipolarity in the Structure of Current Affect, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 4, pp. 967-984, (1998); Fournier S., Avery J., The Uninvited Brand, Business Horizons, 54, 3, pp. 193-207, (2011); Gallagher E., (2015); Glance N., Hurst M., Nigam K., Siegler M., Stockton R., Tomokiyo T., pp. 419-428, (2005); Griffiths T.L., Steyvers M., Finding Scientific Topics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 101, pp. 5228-5235, (2004); Hauser J.R., Koppelman F.S., Alternative Perceptual Mapping Techniques: Relative Accuracy and Usefulness, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, 4, pp. 495-506, (1979); Holmes-Higgin P., (1994); Hu Y., Xu A., Hong Y., Gal D., Sinha V., Akkiraju R., Generating Business Intelligence Through Social media Analytics: Measuring Brand Personality with Consumer-, Employee-, and Firm-Generated Content, Journal of Management Information Systems, 36, 3, pp. 893-930, (2019); Jones L., (2021); Jurafsky D., Martin J.H., (2020); Jurafsky D., Ranganath R., McFarland D., Extracting Social Meaning: Identifying Interactional Style in Spoken Conversation, Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 638-646, (2009); Kapadia S., (2019); Kelly G.A., The Psychology of Personal Constructs: Vol 1 and 2, (1955); Lee T.Y., Bradlow E.T., Automated Marketing Research Using Online Customer Reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 48, 5, pp. 881-894, (2011); Liu L., Dzyabura D., Mizik N., Visual Listening in: Extracting Brand Image Portrayed on Social Media, Marketing Science, 39, 4, pp. 669-686, (2020); Mihalcea R., (2006); Mimno D., Wallach H., Talley E., Leenders M., McCallum A., pp. 262-272, (2011); Monroe B.L., Colaresi M.P., Quinn K.M., Fightin’ Words: Lexical Feature Selection and Evaluation for Identifying the Content of Political Conflict, Political Analysis, 16, pp. 372-403, (2008); Nam H., Joshi Y.V., Kannan P.K., Harvesting Brand Information from Social Tags, Journal of Marketing, 81, 4, pp. 88-108, (2017); Nam H., Kannan P.K., The Informational Value of Social Tagging Networks, Journal of Marketing, 78, 4, pp. 21-40, (2014); Netzer O., Feldman R., Goldenberg J., Fresko M., Mine Your Own Business: Market-Structure Surveillance Through Text Mining, Marketing Science, 31, 3, pp. 521-543, (2012); Newman D., Bonilla E.V., Buntine W., Improving Topic Coherence with Regularized Topic Models, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 24.

In this paper, we build upon information overload theory and propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the complexity of the line of argumentation. To test this idea, we implement state-of-the-art machine learning methods that allow us to study the line of argumentation in reviews at the sentence-level. Our empirical analysis based on a dataset of Amazon customer reviews suggests that line of argumentation and review length are closely intertwined such that longer reviews with frequent changes between positive and negative arguments are perceived as less helpful. Our work has important implications for marketing professionals and retailer platforms that can utilize our results to optimize their customer feedback systems, enhance reviewer guidelines, and include more useful product reviews. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Argumentation patterns; Consumer reviews; Data-driven decision-making; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Online word-of-mouth","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., Online review helpfulness: Role of qualitative factors, Psychology & Marketing, 33, 11, pp. 1006-1017, (2016); Allen M., Meta-analysis comparing the persuasiveness of one-sided and two-sided messages, Western Journal Of Speech Communication, 55, 4, pp. 390-404, (1991); am Vermeer S., Araujo T., Bernritter S.F., van Noort G., Seeing the wood for the trees: How machine learning can help firms in identifying relevant electronic word-of-mouth in social media, International Journal Of Research In Marketing, 36, 3, pp. 492-508, (2019); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Deriving the pricing power of product features by mining consumer reviews, Management Science, 57, 8, pp. 1485-1509, (2011); Baek H., Ahn J., Choi Y., Helpfulness of online consumer reviews: Readers’ objectives and review cues, International Journal Of Electronic Commerce, 17, 2, pp. 99-126, (2012); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W.W., Netzer O., Schweidel D.A., Uniting the tribes: Using text for marketing insight, Journal Of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Bettman J.R., Memory factors in consumer choice: A review, Journal Of Marketing, 43, 2, pp. 37-53, (1979); Branco F., Sun M., Villas-Boas J.M., Optimal search for product information, Management Science, 58, 11, pp. 2037-2056, (2012); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Multimodel inference: Understanding AIC and BIC in model selection, Sociological Methods & Research, 33, 2, pp. 261-304, (2004); Cao Q., Duan W., Gan Q., Exploring determinants of voting for the “helpfulness” of online user reviews: A text mining approach, Decision Support Systems, 50, 2, pp. 511-521, (2011); Chen C., Qiu M., Yang Y., Zhou J., Huang J., Li X., Et al., (2019); Chen C.C., Tseng Y.-D., Quality evaluation of product reviews using an information quality framework, Decision Support Systems, 50, 4, pp. 755-768, (2011); Chen Y., Xie J., Online consumer review: Word-of-mouth as a new element of marketing communication mix, Management Science, 54, 3, pp. 477-491, (2008); Chen C., Zhang M., Liu Y., Ma S., (2018); Cheng Y.-H., Ho H.-Y., Social influence's impact on reader perceptions of online reviews, Journal Of Business Research, 68, 4, pp. 883-887, (2015); Cheung C.M.-Y., Sia C.-L., Kuan K.K.Y., Is this review believable?

Monitoring this reputation in the public sector may bring several benefits for its institutions, especially in supporting decision-making and developing marketing campaigns. Thus, to offer a solution aimed at the needs of this sector, the goal of this research was to develop a methodology capable of extracting relevant information about eWOM in social media, using text mining and natural language processing techniques. Our goal was achieved through a methodology capable of handling the small amount of information regarding public state organizations in social media.

However, the true value of social media data is rarely discovered due to overloaded information. Existing literature in analyzing online hotel reviews mainly focuses on a single data resource, lexicon, and analysis method and rarely provides marketing insights and decision-making information to improve business’ service and quality of products. We propose an integrated framework which includes a data crawler, data preprocessing, sentiment-sensitive tree construction, convolution tree kernel classification, aspect extraction and category detection, and visual analytics to gain insights into hotel ratings and reviews. The empirical findings show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms as well as well-known sentiment classification methods, and achieves high precision (0.95) and recall (0.96). The visual analytics results reveal that Business travelers tend to give lower ratings, while Couples tend to give higher ratings. In general, users tend to rate lowest in July and highest in December. The Business travelers more frequently use negative keywords, such as “rude,” “terrible,” “horrible,” “broken,” and “dirty,” to express their dissatisfied emotions toward their hotel stays in July. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Google trends; Hospitality; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; TripAdvisor; Visual analytics","Decision making; Forestry; Hotels; Quality control; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Visual languages; Visualization; Google trends; Hospitality; NAtural language processing; Social media analytics; TripAdvisor; Visual analytics; Data mining","","","","","","","Aydogan E., Akcayol M.A., A comprehensive survey for sentiment analysis tasks using machine learning techniques, 2016 international symposium on innovations in intelligent systems and applications (INISTA), pp. 1-7, (2016); F.Bangwayo-Skeete P., W.Skeete R., Can google data improve the forecasting performance of tourist arrivals?

Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.","decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization","Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Decision-focused learning; Differentiable greedy; Edge bundling; End to end; End-to-end learning; Graph visualization; Influence maximizations; Influential nodes; Maximization problem; Model prediction; Data visualization","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE).","Chen W., Wang C., Wang Y., Scalable Influence Maximization for Prevalent Viral Marketing in Large-Scale Social Networks, Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’10, pp. 1029-1038; Bond R., Fariss C., Jones J., Kramer A., Marlow C., Settle J., Fowler J., A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization, Nature, 489, pp. 295-298, (2012); Bedi M., Social networks, government surveillance, and the Fourth Amendment Mosaic Theory, BUL Rev, 94, (2014); Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’03, pp. 137-146; Sakaue S., Differentiable Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization: Guarantees, Gradient Estimators, and Applications, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 130, pp. 28-36, (2021); Anscombe F.J., Graphs in Statistical Analysis, Am.

This systematic review focuses on the evolving research area of Social Opinion Mining, tasked with the identification of multiple opinion dimensions, such as subjectivity, sentiment polarity, emotion, affect, sarcasm and irony, from user-generated content represented across multiple social media platforms and in various media formats, like text, image, video and audio. Through Social Opinion Mining, natural language can be understood in terms of the different opinion dimensions, as expressed by humans. This contributes towards the evolution of Artificial Intelligence which in turn helps the advancement of several real-world use cases, such as customer service and decision making. A thorough systematic review was carried out on Social Opinion Mining research which totals 485 published studies and spans a period of twelve years between 2007 and 2018. The in-depth analysis focuses on the social media platforms, techniques, social datasets, language, modality, tools and technologies, and other aspects derived. Social Opinion Mining can be utilised in many application areas, ranging from marketing, advertising and sales for product/service management, and in multiple domains and industries, such as politics, technology, finance, healthcare, sports and government. The latest developments in Social Opinion Mining beyond 2018 are also presented together with future research directions, with the aim of leaving a wider academic and societal impact in several real-world applications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Emotion analysis; Irony detection; Microblogs; Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Sarcasm detection; Sentiment analysis; Social data; Social data analysis; Social media; Social networks; Social opinion mining; Subjectivity analysis; Survey; Systematic review","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision making; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Customer services; Future research directions; Latest development; Multiple channels; Social interactions; Social media platforms; Tools and technologies; User-generated content; Text mining","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2106); ADAPT - Centre for Digital Content Technology","This work is funded by the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology which is funded under the SFI Research Centres Programme (Grant No. 13/RC/2106).

Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States","Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon. © 2022 The Authors","Deep Contextual Language Models; Machine Learning; Meta-Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Transfer Learning","","","","","","Claussen-Simon-Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (460037581, HE 6703/1–2)","This work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) research unit 1452, HE 6703/1–2, and by research grant number 460037581.

However, the risk of failure of a new solution must be properly weighted during the decision-making in the design activity. This study proposes a method to evaluate a new design solution through the comparison with an old one to be substituted, and based on their requirements. In order to better evaluate the new solution, new requirements about its specific peculiarities are extracted from patents of similar solutions and considered in the evaluation. Requirements extraction is carried out automatically, through natural language processing, while the evaluation considers technical, marketing, and economic criteria. In particular, financial proceeds and patents investments were considered. The proposed method was applied in a real industrial case study were the substitution of carbon fiber heating mat over the copper heating mat was assessed. This study contributes to support creativity in innovation design by providing unknown requirements on which to work on the new product. In addition, it can stimulate the designer on this aim, by presenting the requirements along with new ideas, already implementing them in other fields/contexts that can act as sources of inspiration or creativity triggers. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decision making;

Sellers and ecommerce firms use social media to increase user engagement, visibility, and sales. Seller ratings are as important as the product ratings on ecommerce platforms to drive buying decisions. Based on sellers’ actions on social media, this study examines seller turnover and disengagement on e-commerce platforms. The study has been supported by the justice theory. Seller reviews and ratings from e-commerce platforms and conversations from social media platforms have been gathered. Using natural language processing, machine learning, partial least squares (PLS) path analysis, and statistical inferences, objectives of the study are met. The study offers recommendations for both practitioners and researchers. The sellers must focus more on interaction and communication than marketing. Through a longitudinal analysis, the study also establishes that ecommerce organizations can use seller social media performance as a predictor of future seller churn and disengagement so they can take the necessary remedial action. © 2023 IGI Global.

The constant access to volume, variety, and veracity of data has made big data an integral part of management studies. New sub-management areas are emerging day by day with the support of big data to drive businesses. This study takes a systematic literature review approach to uncover the emerging management areas supported by big data in contemporary times. For this, we have analyzed the research papers published in the reputed management journals in the last ten years, fir using network analysis followed by natural language processing summarization techniques to find the emerging new management areas which are yet to get much attention. Furthermore, we ran the same exercise in each of these management areas to uncover these areas better. This research will act as a reference for future information systems (IS) scholars who want to perform analysis that is deep-dive in nature on each of these management areas, which in the coming times will get all the due attention to become dedicated research domains in the management area. We finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of future research in each of these management areas, which will be a true value addition for IS researchers. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data;

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is related to contextual mining of texts which helps in identification and extraction of subjective information from the source material. Sentiment analysis is being used for brand monitoring and reputation management across different market segments. It helps to understand how the public perceive a particular brand, product or service that is highly useful for different tech companies, marketing agencies, media organizations, fashion brands etc. In today’s scenario we have been suffering with data overload which makes it impossible to analyze public sentiments without any sort of error or bias. Sentiment analysis provides better insights into the public reviews as it can be automated which ultimately helps in decision making. There are various deep learning and machine learning methods and models as well as natural language processing tools which help in examining and analyzing public opinions with low time complexity. However, deep learning methods have become highly popular in recent times as these models provide high efficiency and accuracy. In this review paper we have provided a complete overview of the common deep learning frameworks being employed for sentiment classification and analysis. This paper discusses various learning models, evaluation, text representations and other metrics in deep learning architectures. The key findings of different authors have been discussed in detail. This paper will help other researchers in understanding the deep learning techniques being used for sentiment analysis. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep learning; Deep Neural networks (DNN); Machine learning; Natural Language Processing; Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN); Sentiment Analysis","","","","","","","","Abdelgwad M.

Brand management is a continuous systematic project involving multiple subjects. Among them, the problem of government policy attention in the field of brand management of agricultural products with GIs deserves in-depth study. This paper aims to construct a policy attention analysis model in the field of brand management of GI agricultural products based on natural language processing technology. This model provides technical support for local governments to explore the status quo of local GI agricultural products' brand management, analyze the distribution of policy attention, and assist in optimizing strategies to promote their products' brand development. [Method/Process] The study is focused on the distribution of attention paths of GI agricultural products' brand management policies from the perspective of the local government: an analysis model of brand management policies of GI agricultural products was constructed in order to support the local government to carry out the analysis of the status quo of local agricultural products' brand management and policy optimization, and provide decision-making support for the optimization of brand management measures of the local agricultural products. First, this paper built a basic corpus based on the Python crawler technology, collected authoritative public information on the Internet, utilized the domain dictionary and UIE general information extraction framework to extract the text of management measures published in local government policies, and built a database of brand management measures of GI agricultural product. Second, a classification model of brand management measures of GI agricultural products based on the Transformer model was constructed. Third, this paper built a classification model based on the Transformer model, which can classify the extracted brand management measures of agricultural products and construct the policy attention distribution map. Finally, based on the policy attention distri-bution given by the model, we can find the brand management bottlenecks and recommend countermeasures to solve the bottlenecks. [Results/Conclusions] This paper takes Yantai apples as an example for model validation. After extracting and categorizing Yantai apples' brand management data, it is found that the policy attention of Yantai apples is more con-centrated, and the measures are highly similar, with 41.1% of the text of the measures focused on the part of brand positioning and planning, 31.7% on the part of brand competitiveness enhancement, and less than 10% on the part of brand marketing and protection. It can be seen that the brand effect of Yantai apples with GIs has not been well utilized. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology/Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi.

From blogs to social media and online reviews, consumers generate a huge amount of brand-related information that has a decisive potential business value for marketing purposes. Particularly, we focus on online reviews that could have an influence on brand image and positioning. Within this context, and using the usual quantitative star score ratings, a recent stream of research has employed sentiment analysis (SA) tools to examine the textual content of reviews and categorize buyer opinions. Although many SA tools split comments into negative or positive, a review can contain phrases with different polarities because the user can have different sentiments about each feature of the product. Finding the polarity of each feature can be interesting for product managers and brand management. In this paper, we present a general framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, text data mining, and clustering techniques, to obtain new scores based on consumer sentiments for different product features. The main contribution of our proposal is the combination of price and the aforementioned scores to define a new global score for the product, which allows us to obtain a ranking according to product features. Furthermore, the products can be classified according to their positive, neutral, or negative features (visualized on dashboards), helping consumers with their sustainable purchasing behavior. We proved the validity of our approach in a case study using big data extracted from Amazon online reviews (specifically cell phones), obtaining satisfactory and promising results. After the experimentation, we could conclude that our work is able to improve recommender systems by using positive, neutral, and negative customer opinions and by classifying customers based on their comments. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Feature selection; Marketing decisions; Sentiment analysis","creative industry; data mining; decision making; marketing; media role; ranking; social media; sustainable development; valuation; World Wide Web","","","","","Conselleria de Educaci?n; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CloudDriver4Industry TIN2017-89266-R, PROMETEO/2018/089); Conselleria d'Educació, Investigació, Cultura i Esport, (AICO/2017/134)","Funding text 1: Funding: This study was partially funded by the ECLIPSE-UA (RTI2018-094283-B-C32) and RESCATA (TIN2015-65100-R) projects of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and PROMETEO/2018/089.

In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Galaz V., Centeno M.

Traveler preference is unpredictable for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers. Data are derived from 118,000 records of online reviews. The methods and findings can help hotel managers gain insights into travelers' interests, enabling the former to gain a better understanding of the rapid changes in tourist preferences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Data mining; Emerging pattern mining; Hotel preference; Natural language processing; Travel behavior","data mining; demand analysis; Internet; performance assessment; service sector; strategic approach; corporate strategy; industrial performance; marketing; preference behavior; product development; travel behavior","","","","","Chinese Department of Education; Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Guangzhou Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71361007); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1:  Xinyuan (Roy) Zhao , Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in Hospitality Management at Business School, Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSBS).
