Traditional webcast has the shortcomings of poor user experience, low interactivity and low content quality, which makes it difficult to meet the diversified and personalized consumption requirements of the audience. In this context, the live broadcast system based on social media platform has become one of the effective means to solve these problems. The new media online live emotional marketing has a strong transmissibility, which can provide consumers with more rich and interesting ways to obtain information, and can also improve the effect of brand promotion and word of mouth promotion. Based on the theory of multimodal learning, this paper analyzed the characteristics of user behavior among different types of social networking sites, and explored the emotional interaction mode on social networking sites from the visual and voice dimensions, and provided a basis for the formulation of emotional marketing strategies for webcasting and business decision-making. The article also compared the traditional live broadcast marketing mode with the online live broadcast emotional marketing under the new media environment. The results showed that the live broadcast marketing under the new media environment has a better effect, and the sales volume has also increased by 3.87%. It can effectively control costs and audience satisfaction is also higher. The computer vision multimodal learning technology based on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) can dynamically identify the live content, and use intelligent voice assistants to help users achieve personalized interactive communication, bringing consumers a more intuitive experience. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers. © 2016 INFORMS.","Collaborative filtering; Retailing; Video analysis","","","","","","City University of Hong Kong and Cambridge Judge Business School; Institute for Sustainable Innovation and Growth; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71232008, 71502039); Fudan University","The authors thank the participants in presentations given by the authors, in the College of Business at City University of Hong Kong and Cambridge Judge Business School, for their feedback; as well as the editor, the area editor, and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout. © 2022, The Author(s).","Business intelligence; CCTV visual intelligence; Retail layout; Store layout; Video analytic","Deep learning; Retail stores; Security systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; CCTV visual intelligence; Customer decisions; In-store marketing; Layout designs; Retail layout; Store layout; Sub fields; Video analytics; Visual intelligence; Sales","","","","","Queensland University of Technology, QUT; School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering, Queensland University of Technology; Business School, Queensland University of Technology; Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, IFE; Faculty of Education, Queensland University of Technology; Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology; Centre for Materials Science, Queensland University of Technology","","Ahmed A.H., Kpalma K., Guedi A.O., Human detection using hog-svm, mixture of gaussian and background contours subtraction, 2017 13Th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), pp. 334-338, (2017); Anic I.D., Radas S., Lim L.K., Relative effects of store traffic and customer traffic flow on shopper spending, Int Rev Retail Distrib Consum Res, 20, 2, pp. 237-250, (2010); Artificial Intelligence for Retail in 2020: 12 Real-World Use Cases; Barghash M.A., Al-Qatawneh L., Ramadan S., Dababneh A., Analytical hierarchy process applied to supermarket layout selection, J Appl Res Ind Eng, 4, 4, pp. 215-226, (2017); Bill M., Dale M., Superstore interactivity: a new self-service paradigm of retail service?, Int J Retail Distrib Manag, 29, 8, pp. 379-389, (2001); Bochkovskiy A., Wang C.Y., Liao H.Y.M., Yolov4: Optimal speed and accuracy of object detection, Corr Arxiv: Abs/2004, 10934, 2020, (2020); Caetano C., Sena J., Bremond F., Dos Santos J.A., Schwartz W.R., Skelemotion: A new representation of skeleton joint sequences based on motion information for 3d action recognition, 2019 16Th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), pp. 1-8, (2019); Cai Y., Wen L., Zhang L., Du D., Wang W., Rethinking object detection in retail stores, The 35Th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2021); Cao J., Li Y., Zhang Z., Partially shared multi-task convolutional neural network with local constraint for face attribute learning, 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4290-4299, (2018); Chen Y., Tian Y., He M., Monocular human pose estimation: a survey of deep learning-based methods, Comput Vis Image Underst, 192, (2020); Chu P., Wang J., You Q., Ling H., Liu Z., Transmot: Spatial-temporal graph transformer for multiple object tracking, Corr, (2021); Cil I., Consumption universes based supermarket layout through association rule mining and multidimensional scaling, Expert Syst Appl, 39, 10, pp. 8611-8625, (2012); Cil I., Ay D., Turkan Y.S., Data driven decision support to supermarket layout, Proceedings of the 8Th WSEAS International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering and Data Bases, AIKED’09, pp. 465-470, (2009); Davenport T., Guha A., Grewal D., Bressgott T., How artificial intelligence will change the future of marketing, J Acad Mark Sci, 48, 1, pp. 24-42, (2020); Donovan R.J., Rossiter J.R., Marcoolyn G., Nesdale A., Store atmosphere and purchasing behavior, J Retail, 70, 3, pp. 283-294, (1994); Don’t Look Now: Why You Should Be Worried about Machines Reading Your Emotions, (2020); DrAsze X., Hoch S.J., Purk M.E., Shelf management and space elasticity, J Retail, 70, 4, pp. 301-326, (1994); Fernando T., Denman S., Sridharan S., Fookes C., Tracking by prediction: A deep generative model for mutli-person localisation and tracking, 2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).
