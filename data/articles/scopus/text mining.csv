This study explores the case of Capraia, a small island located in Tuscany, to analyze how tourists (tourism demand) and local operators (tourism supply) create and communicate the island’s online image. This research quantitatively examines online communication on the two sides of the tourism market to monitor the online destination image of the island of Capraia. To build on previous research in this area, this study adopts a web content mining approach to assess the characteristics of content published online. The main dimensions of destination image (as developed in the literature) are used as a basis to create a dictionary for automated content analysis. A total of 24 tourism promotion websites and 9,180 tourist Instagram posts were analyzed. Findings reveal discrepancies between the image proposed by local operators and that perceived by tourists. Local operators mostly communicate general information to discover the destination, while tourists prioritize communication based on emotional appeal and personal experience on the island. This research aims to provide support for local operators and policy makers in decisions relating to communication and in defining the island image. © Island Studies Journal, 2021.","Capraia island; content analysis; destination image; destination marketing; text mining; tourist consumer behaviour","","","","","","Regione Toscana","This work was supported by the Tuscany Region (Italy) under PROSVINT project.","Alcaniz E.

The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures. Because the index is a work in progress, the authors discuss how to overcome current limitations and suggest correlating the index with citation counts, altmetrics, and readability measures. Marketing practitioners, authors, and journal editors can use the index to assess article relevance, and academic administrators can use it for promotion and tenure decisions (see www.R2Mindex.com). The R2M Index is thus not only a measurement instrument but also a tool for change. © American Marketing Association 2021.","information retrieval; marketing; marketing practice‌; marketing theory; relevance;

The paper also proposes a conceptual model that SMEs can use to transform simple qualitative and quantitative data into knowledge that is useful for supporting the decision-making process in the context of international marketing. The presentation of the proposed interpretative model is followed by the application to the wine market in the USA. Comparison of the themes typical of online discourse in the worlds of supply and demand highlights a certain communicative misalignment that SMEs can resolve by adopting suitable communicative strategies.

Therefore wearing medical protective clothing as an effective form of personal protection plays an extremely important role in personal protection. However the research and development of medical protective clothing in China started late and there is not only the problem of mismatch between application scenarios and product functions but also most research and development are conducted from the perspective of professional medical personnel. In addition consumers apply medical protective clothing in a richer and more diverse scenario and the post-purchase evaluation of consumers can not only reflect their demand for medical protective clothing and influence other consumers' purchase decisions on medical protective clothing but also serve as an important basis for relevant enterprises to consider developing and improving their marketing strategies. To deeply understand current consumer' s view and demand for medical protective clothing this paper based on the collected content of 11 513 consumer reviews of 14 Chinese medical protective clothing brands carried out keyword frequency analysis sentiment analysis network analysis and co-occurrence network analysis accurately revealing the consumers' shopping experience perception and demand. The study shows that product quality and express efficiency are the most important factors influencing consumers' post-purchase evaluation followed by merchant services and application scenarios while affordable price only plays an important role in positive evaluation product quality and packaging are of great concern to consumers in the positive evaluation consumers are quite content with product quality workmanship material size comfort breathability product packaging and gifts express efficiency delivery and logistics speed price cheap price and merchant service customer service staff service attitude and service response speed . The consumers also express the need to buy medical protective clothing for timely and safe protection in daily life during the epidemic and in scenarios such as air travel. In the negative evaluation consumers' dissatisfaction is mainly focused on product quality express efficiency and merchant service such as poor product quality the clothing is too large to be worn the product and related gifts are broken when received and the product material is thin poor express efficiency slow delivery and logistics after the product is ordered and poor merchant service poor customer service attitude no timely response to information omission of products slow invoicing and difficulty to refund . This exploratory study provides new research ideas for consumer experience and valuable reference for the marketing management practices of medical protective clothing enterprises. This study provides valuable reference information for medical protective clothing companies' product and service improvement logistics partner selection product design and development and price marketing strategies by digging deeper into the content of medical protective clothing consumer reviews and outlining more clearly the concerns of consumers in the process of purchasing medical protective clothing. © 2023 China Silk Association.

Stern School of Business, United States","An important use of the internet today is in providing a platform for consumers to disseminate information about products and services they buy, and share experiences about the merchants with whom they transact. Increasingly, online markets develop into social shopping channels, and facilitate the creation of online communities and social networks. Till date, businesses, government organisations and customers have not fully incorporated such information in their decision making and policy formulation processes, either because the potential value of the intellectual capital or appropriate techniques for measuring that value have not been identified. Increasingly, although, this publicly available digital content has concrete economic value that is often hidden beneath the surface. For example, online product reviews affect the buying behaviour of customers, as well as the volume of sales, positively or negatively. Similarly, user feedback on sites such as eBay and Amazon affect the reputation of online merchants and, in turn, their ability to sell their products and services. Our research on the EconoMining project studies the economic value of user-generated content in such online settings. In our research program, we combine established techniques from economics and marketing with text mining algorithms from computer science to measure the economic value of each text snippet. In this paper, we describe the foundational blocks of our techniques, and demonstrate the value of user-generated content in a variety of areas, including reputation systems and online product reviews, and we present examples of how such areas are of immediate importance to the travel industry. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","E-commerce; Econometrics; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; User-generated content","","","","","","","","Akerlof G.A., The market for 'Lemons': Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P., Show Me the Money!

However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results; (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers; and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Online review; Review mining; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Social network","Data mining; Electronic commerce; Experiments; Independent component analysis; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Classification performance; Classification results; Marketing strategy; Online product reviews; Online reviews; Potential customers; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Online systems","","","","","National Key Technology RD Program, (2012BAH16F02); Southwest University of Finance and Economics; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61003254, 91218301); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported in part by the National Key Technology RD Program (No. 2012BAH16F02 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61003254 and 91218301 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , as well as Financial Service Innovation Team Development Project at Southwest University of Finance and Economics (2012) .

Owing to the widespread and rapid information dissemination of online automotive forums, they have become an important source for manufacturers to collect product defect information and understand consumer preferences. The purpose of this study is to investigate car defect information and consumer preferences from online automotive forums and segment consumers based on consumer preferences, which holds great promise as a means for companies to improve product design and consumer relationship management. Based on text data of China's top-ranked Pacific Auto Network, we applied the LDA model, sentiment analysis, text classification, and cluster analysis methods to determine the influencing factors of automobile consumers’ purchasing behavior, identified automobile product defects, and subdivided consumer groups. The results show that the factors affecting consumers’ car buying behavior are low fuel consumption, affordable price, superior performance, fashionable appearance, and comfortable use. Car product defects are mainly reflected in the three aspects of the car's performance, comfort, and configuration; there are six kinds of consumer groups: price seekers, fuel consumption seekers, performance seekers, comfort seekers, cost performance seekers, and appearance seekers. Of these, cost performance seekers make up the largest proportion, and they constitute the largest group of intention purchasers. These findings can help enterprises develop targeted product improvement programs, but also provide a decision-making basis for enterprises to achieve precision marketing. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","auto forum; consumer groups; online review; product defects; text mining","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71372020, 71774035); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, (LH2020G005)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 71774035, 71372020) and Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (Grant LH2020G005).

This systematic review focuses on the evolving research area of Social Opinion Mining, tasked with the identification of multiple opinion dimensions, such as subjectivity, sentiment polarity, emotion, affect, sarcasm and irony, from user-generated content represented across multiple social media platforms and in various media formats, like text, image, video and audio. Through Social Opinion Mining, natural language can be understood in terms of the different opinion dimensions, as expressed by humans. This contributes towards the evolution of Artificial Intelligence which in turn helps the advancement of several real-world use cases, such as customer service and decision making. A thorough systematic review was carried out on Social Opinion Mining research which totals 485 published studies and spans a period of twelve years between 2007 and 2018. The in-depth analysis focuses on the social media platforms, techniques, social datasets, language, modality, tools and technologies, and other aspects derived. Social Opinion Mining can be utilised in many application areas, ranging from marketing, advertising and sales for product/service management, and in multiple domains and industries, such as politics, technology, finance, healthcare, sports and government. The latest developments in Social Opinion Mining beyond 2018 are also presented together with future research directions, with the aim of leaving a wider academic and societal impact in several real-world applications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Emotion analysis; Irony detection; Microblogs; Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Sarcasm detection; Sentiment analysis; Social data; Social data analysis; Social media; Social networks; Social opinion mining; Subjectivity analysis; Survey; Systematic review","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision making; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Customer services; Future research directions; Latest development; Multiple channels; Social interactions; Social media platforms; Tools and technologies; User-generated content; Text mining","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2106); ADAPT - Centre for Digital Content Technology","This work is funded by the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology which is funded under the SFI Research Centres Programme (Grant No. 13/RC/2106).

Employing co-citation and text-mining techniques to investigate 281 articles, we identified five knowledge fields that map the intellectual structure of this domain: brand equity, industrial branding, brand value, global brand leadership, and relationship marketing. We also gained a deeper understanding of the important topics in global B2B branding literature. This framework not only highlights gaps and challenges in conceptual and methodological approaches but also challenges and extends existing academic discourse.

Over a billion new posts are uploaded every day to Facebook’s applications (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). Social networks play a central role in consumption and marketing, politics, and social aspects. They affect users' decision-making processes, emotions, and behavior. Content on social media can include, for example, movies, pictures, and texts. The emotion expressed in the post content has an influence on the exposed individuals. Emotions can cause the user exposed to the content to follow another user, view more content raised by a certain user, share a post, or express support (or lack of support), thus affecting the popularity of the user. In this work, we examined the relationship between emotions expressed by a character and popularity measures. As a case study, we analyzed the texts presented in the popular series “Friends” over ten seasons. We found that women in the series express more emotions in general and, in particular, more emotions of anticipation, joy, trust, and fear. The findings show the relationship between different emotions expressed in the content and various popularity measures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Emotion detection; Popularity measures; Social network analysis; Text mining","Behavioral research; Decision making; Emotion Recognition; Social networking (online); Decision-making behaviors; Decision-making process; Emotion detection; Facebook; Network-based; Popularity measure; Social media; Social Network Analysis; Text-mining; Use social networks; Social aspects","","","","","","","Abbas M.J., Khalil L.S., Haikal A., Dash M.E., Dongmo G., Okoroha K.R., Eliciting emotion and action increases social media engagement: an analysis of influential orthopaedic surgeons, Arthrosc Sports Med Rehabilit, 3, 5, pp. e1301-e1308, (2021); Bastian M., Heymann S., Jacomy M., Gephi: An open source software for exploring and manipulating networks, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, (2009); Carrasco Polaino R., Villar Cirujano E., Martin Cardaba M.A., Redes, tweets y engagement: análisis de las bibliotecas universitarias españolas en Twitter, El Prof De La Inf, 28, 4, pp. 1-14, (2019); Carrasco-Polaino R., Villar-Cirujano E., Martin-Cardaba M.A., Artivismo Y ONG: Relación Entre Imagen Y Engagement En Instagram= Artivism and NGO: Relationship between Image and Engagement in Instagram, pp. 29-38, (2018); Chakraborty K., Bhattacharyya S., Bag R., A survey of sentiment analysis from social media data, IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, 7, 2, pp. 450-464, (2020); Csardi M.G., Package ‘igraph’, Last Accessed, 3, 9, (2013); Figueiredo F., Almeida J.M., Goncalves M.A., Benevenuto F., On the dynamics of social media popularity: a YouTube case study, ACM Trans Internet Technol TOIT, 14, 4, pp. 1-23, (2014); Figueiredo F., Almeida J.M., Goncalves M.A., Benevenuto F., Trendlearner: early prediction of popularity trends of user generated content, Inf Sci, 349, pp. 172-187, (2016); Fletcher J.M., Wennekers T., From structure to activity: using centrality measures to predict neuronal activity, Int J Neural Syst, 28, 2, (2018); Freeman L.C., A set of measures of centrality based on betweenness, Sociometry, 40, pp. 35-41, (1977); Freeman L.C., Centrality in social networks: conceptual clarification, Social network: critical concepts in sociology, vol 1, pp. 238-263, (2002); Gautam G., Yadav D., Sentiment analysis of twitter data using machine learning approaches and semantic analysis, 2014 Seventh International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), (2014); Gundecha P., Liu H., Mining social media: A brief introduction, New Directions in Informatics, Optimization, Logistics, and Production, pp. 1-17, (2012); Herman V., Dramatic discourse: dialogue as interaction in plays, (1998); Iglesias C.A., Moreno A., Sentiment Analysis for Social Media, 9, (2019); Kinga E., How to increase engagement on Facebook: Tips, tools, and tactics, Kontentino, (2021); Kivran-Swaine F., Brody S., Diakopoulos N., Naaman M., Of joy and gender: Emotional expression in online social networks, Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work Companion, (2012); Kocic A.V., Stamenkovic D.M., Tasic M.B., Gender differences reflected in friends’ conversation—discourse analysis of dialogues from the tv series coupling, Komun i Kult Online, 5, pp. 52-64, (2014); Kring A.M., Gordon A.H., Sex differences in emotion: expression, experience, and physiology, J Pers Soc Psychol, 74, 3, (1998); Li Y., Xie Y., Is a picture worth a thousand words?

Consumer preference analysis explains what aspects of a product affect and how they affect a consumer's purchasing decision. This issue plays an important role in e-commerce platforms from its relevance in marketing decisions such as advertisements, recommendations and promotions. In this regard, we propose a data-driven multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) approach to integrate online information, such as explicit (e.g., reviews and ratings) and implicit (e.g., clicks and purchases) feedback from consumers. However, MCDA approaches present a critical challenge that even an experienced product manager could find it difficult to pre-define the criteria on which a product is evaluated. To address this issue, our proposed approach first utilizes text-mining techniques to assist the product manager identify the criteria, and then determines and collects the relative importance of the criteria and their values. Given the criteria information, we use a sampling process to provide two indices, the consumer preference index and rank acceptability index. The first index helps in prioritizing the pairwise comparisons of products, while the second one helps in deriving a default ranking list for first-time-registered consumers. We record the products viewed by consumers and generate their preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons for analyses within an aggregation-disaggregation paradigm. We also provide a representative value function to help the product manager gain insight into the preferences. Finally, we describe how a real-world application including the product manager and consumers exploits the proposed approach on an e-commerce platform to take a large step toward aiding more realistic and data-driven multiple criteria decision making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","E-commerce; Multiple criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preference analysis; Preference modeling","Decision making; Decision support systems; Consumers' preferences; Data driven; E- commerces; Multiple criteria; Multiple criteria decision making; Online information; Online reviews; Preference analysis; Preference models; Product manager; article; consumer; decision making; human; manager; mining; sampling; Electronic commerce","","","","","Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71672163, 71701160, 91546119, 91846110)","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( #91846110 , #91546119 , #71701160 , #71672163 ) and the Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities “Big data and Business Intelligent Innovation Team”.

Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; Co-word analysis; Point-of-sale marketing; Scopus; Web of Science","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Fundació Catalana de Trasplantament, FCT, (UIDB/04466/2020, UIDP/04466/2020)","Funding: This work was conducted with the financial support received from the Spanish National Research Programme [R + D+i Research Project ECO2017-88458-R].

Despite the growing number of articles published in the last decade, no comprehensive analysis of the most discussed constructs of cause-related marketing is available. This paper uses an advanced Text Mining methodology (a Bayesian contextual analysis algorithm known as Correlated Topic Model, CTM) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 246 articles published in 40 different journals between 1988 and 2013 on the subject of cause-related marketing. Text Mining also allows quantitative analyses to be performed on the literature. For instance, it is shown that the most prominent long-term topics discussed since 1988 on the subject are “brand-cause fit”, “law and Ethics”, and “corporate and social identification”, while the most actively discussed topic presently is “sectors raising social taboos and moral debates”. The paper has two goals: first, it introduces the technique of CTM to the Marketing area, illustrating how Text Mining may guide, simplify, and enhance review processes while providing objective building blocks (topics) to be used in a review; second, it applies CTM to the C-RM field, uncovering and summarizing the most discussed topics. Mining text, however, is not aimed at replacing all subjective decisions that must be taken as part of literature review methodologies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cause-related marketing; Text mining; Topic models","","","","","","","","Abzug R., Webb N.J., Relationships between nonprofit and for-profit organizations: a stakeholder perspective, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 28, 4, pp. 416-431, (1999); Adkins S., Cause-related marketing: Who cares wins, (1999); Amato L.H., Amato C.H., The effects of firm size and industry on corporate giving, Journal of Business Ethics, 72, 3, pp. 229-241, (2007); Amato L.H., Amato C.H., Retail philanthropy: Firm size, industry, and business cycle, Journal of Business Ethics, 107, 4, pp. 435-448, (2012); Aquino K., Freeman D., Reed A., Lim V.K., Felps W., Testing a social-cognitive model of moral behavior: the interactive influence of situations and moral identity centrality, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97, 1, pp. 123-141, (2009); Arendt S., Brettel M., Understanding the influence of corporate social responsibility on corporate identity, image, and firm performance, Management Decision, 48, 10, pp. 1469-1492, (2010); Asslander M.S., Honorableness or beneficialness?

In recent years, many researches have tried to model the consumers’ decision-making process from different perspectives, like considering consumers' behavior patterns, integrating consumption theories, and utilizing different methods or tools. Most of these researches build models based on the Expected Utility Theory which depends on the ""Rational People"" hypothesis. However, online consumers often make some ""bounded rational"" or ""irrational"" decisions in an electronic commerce environment, due to peers’ influence. Therefore, Prospect Theory, which is dependent on the ""Irrational People"" hypothesis, is selected as the theoretical basis in this paper. We replace the traditional expected utility function with Prospect Theory’s value function to build a reasonable behavioral decision-making model. Moreover, an improvement in value function is acquired by the introduction of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number. We provide our approach in detail as follows. First, we construct the behavioral decision-making model based on Prospect Theory. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy number is introduced to express fuzzy decision-making information, which brings about improved value function, improved weight function as well as improved prospect function. We also build a more appropriate behavioral decision-making model. Therefore, we have determined the basic form of the model. Secondly, the whole service process of B2C electronic commerce is divided into six sub-processes by using service blueprinting. Based on these six sub-processes, the multiple attribute decision-making problem is defined through the determination of the multiple attribute structure and the set of alternatives which includes three dominant B2C platforms in China, e.g. Jingdong (jd.com), Yihaodian (yhd.com) and Dangdang (dangdang.com). Hence, the behavioral decision-making model of online consumers based on Prospect Theory has been determined. Thirdly, the behavioral model of decision-making is quantified by means of text mining of the collected eWOMs (Electronic Word-of-Mouth). The details of the process are showed as follows. First, we construct a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for eWOMs, which classifies eWOMs into different service sub-processes. Then the eWOMs in different sub-processes are clustered by the use of Weka, which is a data mining kit. Based on the clustering results, we can define 13 evaluating indicators and their corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the eWOMs into intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers, which determine the parameters of our model according to the results of sentiment analysis. Therefore, the model is quantified. Finally, we take Jingdong, Yihaodian and Dangdang as examples to test the behavioral model of decision-making. Furthermore, the reliability of this behavioral decision-making model is identified by comparison with the model based on the Expected Utility Theory. The results show that: (1) Compared with the models which are based on Expected Utility Theory, the behavioral decision model proposed in this paper performs better to reveal the practical situation. (2) Results of the calculated examples show that Jingdong scores the highest prospect values, followed by Yihaodian and Dangdang. Clustering of eWOMs results in 13 indicators. Jingdong scores the highest prospect values in seven indicators, while Yihaodian scores the highest ones in four indicators. Though Jingdong takes the highest overall score, its score is the lowest one in after-sales stage, giving rise to a narrowed gap in total score. While Yihaodian’s excellent service recovery help itself to rank second. The results show that proper service recovery strategies contribute to the improvement of service quality © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.","B2C e-commerce; Behavioral decision-making model; Electronic word-of-mouth; Intuitionistic fuzzy number; Prospect Theory","","","","","","","","(2016); 16, pp. 1-9, (2013); Nicosia F M., Consumer decision process: Marketing and advertising implication, (1966); Howard J A, Sheth J N., The theory of buyer behavior [M], (1969); Haubl G, Trifts V., Consumer decision making in online shopping environments: The effects of interactive decision aids [J], Marketing Science, 19, pp. 4-21, (2000); Jarvenpaa S L, Tractinsky N, Saarinen L, Et al., Consumer trust in an internet store: Across-cultural validation, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 5, 2, pp. 1-5, (1999); Talluri K T, Van Ryzin G., The theory and practice of revenue management, (2004); Simon H A., Theories of bounded rationality[J], Decision and Organization, 1, pp. 161-176, (1972); Tversky A, Kahneman D., Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases, Science, 185, 4157, pp. 1124-1131, (1974); 16, 2, (2013); Chevalier J A, Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); 9, 3, pp. 428-437, (2012); 5, pp. 65-75, (2012); Berger J., Word of mouth and interpersonal communication: A review and directions for future research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 586-607, (2014); 17, (2014); Tversky A, Kahneman D., Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 5, 4, pp. 297-323, (1992); 3, (2012); Zuo W M, Huang Q P, Fan C, Zhang Z P., Quality management of B2C E-commerce service based on human factors engineering[J], Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 12, 5, pp. 309-320, (2013); 17, (2006); Chang C C, Lin C J., LIBSVM: a library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, 3, (2011); (2008); Zadeh L.A., Fuzzy sets [J], Information and Control, 8, pp. 338-356, (1965); Chen S J, Hwang C L., Fuzzy multiple attribute decision making: methods and applications [M], (1992); Kahneman D, Tversky A., Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk, Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 47, 2, pp. 263-291, (1979); 7, 5, pp. 11-14, (2005); (2015); McCollough MA, Bharadwaj SG., The recovery paradox: An examination of consumer satisfaction in relation to disconfirmation, service quality, and attribution based theories[J], Marketing Theory and Applications, 3, (1992); 3, pp. 105-113, (2014); 31, 5, pp. 74-80, (2012)","","","Zhejiang University","","","","","","10046062","","","","English","J.

The constant access to volume, variety, and veracity of data has made big data an integral part of management studies. New sub-management areas are emerging day by day with the support of big data to drive businesses. This study takes a systematic literature review approach to uncover the emerging management areas supported by big data in contemporary times. For this, we have analyzed the research papers published in the reputed management journals in the last ten years, fir using network analysis followed by natural language processing summarization techniques to find the emerging new management areas which are yet to get much attention. Furthermore, we ran the same exercise in each of these management areas to uncover these areas better. This research will act as a reference for future information systems (IS) scholars who want to perform analysis that is deep-dive in nature on each of these management areas, which in the coming times will get all the due attention to become dedicated research domains in the management area. We finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of future research in each of these management areas, which will be a true value addition for IS researchers. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data;

Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","COVID Twitter data; Machine learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Conventional machines; COVID twitter data; Feature engineerings; Learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction; Streaming texts; Text analysis; Forecasting","","","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","The authors would like to thank Ali Hussain Khan and Asif Iqbal Middya for their contribution in developing the CitizenSense application.

Given that blood cannot be produced artificially, donors are the backbone of the system, which is why it is crucial for transfusion centers to understand the factors that determine their behavior. The goal of this study is to help decision-makers at transfusion understand what lines of research have been developed in the literature and which ones might be useful to define and assess actions related to the attributes of the donation system and donor behavior. To that end, this work aims to present an overview of the available literature on blood donor behavior from a social marketing perspective, which is of paramount importance in the context of blood donation.

A ‘health-promoting school’ provides the conceptual framework for this intervention. A large boarding school developed, implemented and refined a Nutritional Symbol System for their dining hall. The effectiveness of this social marketing strategy and school-based Health Education Program was evaluated by interviewing students (n = 16) for nutritional knowledge and application of the Nutritional Symbol System (NSS) to food choices in a range of contexts within (for example, in the dining hall and canteen) and beyond the school. In-depth interview data were collected, recorded and analyzed manually and via the Leximancer text mining software. Results indicated that there was a lack of consistent and accurate student knowledge derived from the Health Education Programs. Recommendations include a greater alignment between the Nutritional Symbol System, the plate and all Health Education Program materials to enhance students' health literacy around informed nutrition-related decisions. © 2013 Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation.","Children; Education effectiveness; Nutritional; Social marketing","","","","","","","","Dietary guidelines, (2008); Bell A.C., Swinburn B.A., What are the key food groups to target for preventing obesity and improving nutrition in schools?, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 58, pp. 258-263, (2004); Personal development, health and physical education K–6 syllabus.

We study two related perspectives with regard to what people talk about online and what they intend to do in the adoption phase to offer advice to companies aiming to excel in online marketing efforts. Drawing on the consumption value theory, we examine buyers’ discussions about and intention to use wearable devices for a sample of consumers in Taiwan. A framework is advanced to explore the results of big data analysis employing text-mining techniques (i.e., what people talk about) and survey-based research using structural equation modelling (i.e., what people intend to do). Functional, emotional and conditional values surfaced as the highest Internet buzzes of wearable devices. Conversely, emotional, epistemic and functional values emerged as the most influential drivers of customers’ adoption intention. Our findings suggest that different value dimensions are relevant at different points of the purchase-related decision-making process. Some values animate Internet discussions that pertain to the pre-purchase information search stage, and others appear significant during the formation of people’s purchase intentions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and provide suggestions for future research. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Eurasia Business and Economics Society.","Big data; Consumption value theory; Electronic word-of-mouth; Online consumer behavior; Text mining; Wearable devices","","","","","","","","Alghizzawi M., A survey of the role of social media platforms in viral marketing: The influence of e-WoM, International Journal of Information Technology, 3, 2, pp. 54-60, (2019); Bai X., Predicting consumer sentiments from online text, Decision Support Systems, 50, 4, pp. 732-742, (2011); Banfield R., Eriksson M., Walkingshaw N., Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and Build Successful Teams, (2017); Barlow J., Maul D., Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers, (2000); Bodolica V., Kasih B., Reimagining the post-pandemic industry of arts in the Arab world: Fast-tracked digital uplift or back to business as usual?, Emerald Emerging Markets Case Studies, 11, 3, pp. 1-11, (2021); Bodolica V., Spraggon M., An end-to-end process of writing and publishing influential literature review articles: Do’s and don’ts, Management Decision, 56, 11, pp. 2472-2486, (2018); Bodolica V., Spraggon M., Abou Soueid M., Innovation drivers and trends in the retail industry: An application to emerging markets and the case of the Gulf region, International Journal of Comparative Management, 2, 1, pp. 51-66, (2019); Bodolica V., Spraggon M., Khaddage-Soboh N., Air-travel services industry in the post-COVID-19: The GPS (Guard-Potentiate-Shape) model for crisis navigation, Tourism Review, 76, 4, pp. 942-961, (2021); Bronner F., De Hoog R., Comparing conspicuous consumption across different experiential products: Culture and leisure, International Journal of Market Research, 61, 4, pp. 430-446, (2019); Chang H.S., Lee S.C., Ji Y.G., Wearable device adoption model with TAM and TTF, International Journal of Mobile Communications, 14, 5, pp. 518-537, (2016); Chen K.J., You J.M., A study on word similarity using context vector models, International Journal of Computational Linguistics & Chinese Language Processing, 7, 2, pp. 37-58, (2002); Chen Y.C., Shang R.A., Lin A.K., The intention to download music files in a P2P environment: Consumption value, fashion, and ethical decision perspectives, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7, 4, pp. 411-422, (2008); Cheng J.M.S., Wang E.S.T., Lin J.Y.C., Vivek S.D., Why do customers utilize the internet as a retailing platform?

For this reason, companies must have knowledge of the actual standing of their products on the Web. A warning system for online market research is being proposed which allows the identification of critical situations in online opinion formation. When critical situations are detected, warnings are subsequently sent to marketing managers and thus allowing marketers the ability to initiate preventive measures. The warning system operates on a knowledge base which contains product-related success values, online opinions and patterns of social interactions. This knowledge is acquired using methods coming from information extraction, text mining and social network analysis. Based on this knowledge the warning system judges situations accordingly. For this purpose, a neuro-fuzzy approach is chosen which learns linguistic rules from data. These rules are employed to estimate future situations. The warning system is applied to two scenarios and yields good results. An evaluation shows that all components of the warning system outperform alternative methods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, manufacturers are trying to dominate the market. To achieve this, they must analyze users' reactions to their products and find insights for product improvement through comparison with competitors. We propose a four-step methodological framework for identifying meaningful opinions from a large number of online user reviews. First, network analysis is conducted to compare differences between brands. Next, through topic modeling, the attributes of speakers that users consider the most crucial are extracted for each brand. Third, sentiment analysis is conducted to examine how users' emotional polarities differ for each attribute. Through this, product improvement and product sales plans can be derived. Finally, in order to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each brand, brand positioning is conducted and user opinions that have changed along with the evolution of the speaker's generation are analyzed. Our study identified the factors that positively or negatively affect the experience of smart speaker users. In addition, the proposed method is highly useful because it can be used to derive insights from a large amount of user opinion data regardless of the search term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Brand positioning; Decision support; Online review; Sales planning; Smart speaker; Text analysis","comparative study; decision support system; Internet; marketing; methodology; network analysis","","","","","Yonsei University, (2021-22-0257); Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT, (22CTAP-C163908-02); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement, KAIA","This work was supported by the Yonsei University Research Grant of 2021 ( 2021-22-0257 ).

Laddering interviews were conducted to capture the essence of CPVs, and then text-mining techniques were applied to extract key consumer values from the interviews. Six dimensions of CPV, namely, design, emotional, functional, monetary, guarantee, and social, were identified. The construct validity of these six dimensions was demonstrated through a rigorous sorting process. A best–worst scaling (BWS) survey was then implemented based on these six value dimensions to investigate consumers’ preference for each dimension in three critical decision-making phases of mobile marketing campaigns. Statistical analysis of the BWS data showed that significant dynamic differences exist among these six value dimensions in each phase. Gender difference and consumer heterogeneity were also presented. Theoretical and managerial implications were discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer perceived value; Mixed method; Mobile marketing; Value dimensions; WeChat official account","China; consumption behavior; marketing; mobile phone; preference behavior; social media","","","","","Chinese Ministry of Education Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences Project, (16YJC630038); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71502132, 71602009)","This work was supported by the Chinese Ministry of Education Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences Project (grant number 16YJC630038 ) and partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71502132 and 71602009 ).

However, the existing research on the model construction and quantitative analysis of the psychological process of green consumption behavior needs to be further explored. Therefore, on the basis of green consumption behavior and metacognitive theory, this study constructs a conceptual model of a psychological process with a psychological control source, green consumption attitude, three aspects of metacognition, and green consumption behavior and puts forward the hypothesis of an action mechanism. This study combines text mining technology and expert knowledge to establish a user review mining dictionary and mines the variables in the quantitative conceptual model through word embedding to test empirically the mechanism hypothesis. The results show that psychological control source has a significant impact on green consumption behavior, and green consumption attitude plays a partial mediating role between them. Metacognitive knowledge plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption behavior; metacognitive experience plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption attitude. Metacognitive monitoring plays a moderating role between green consumption attitude and green consumption behavior. In view of the above research results, we put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions: For organizations, it is necessary to identify green consumption groups, attach importance to green consumption experience, perform well in green marketing, and improve the competitiveness of green products; for decision makers, it is necessary to control strictly the industry standards of the green product market and perform well not only in the quality supervision of green products but also in the post-market construction of green products. © 2023 by the authors.","green consumption behavior; metacognitive theory; psychological control source; text mining technology","alternative energy; carbon emission; consumption behavior; decision making; environmental impact; environmental policy; green economy; industrial regulation; quantitative analysis","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (19BSH105)","This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China: 19BSH105 And the APC was funded by [19BSH105].","Stockkamp C., Schaefer J., Millemann J.A.A., Heidenreich S., Identifying Factors Associated with Consumers’ Adoption of e-Mobility-A Systematic Literature Review, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Wang S., Exploring the Sustainability of China’s New Energy Vehicle Development: Fresh Evidence from Population Symbiosis, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Young W., Hwang K., McDonald S., Oates C.J., Sustainable Consumption: Green Consumer Behaviour when Purchasing Products, Sustain.

In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference. The strong empirical evidence indicates that the big e-commerce consumer data facilitates more specialized market psychographic segmentation, which advances data-driven marketing decision-making. © The Author(s) 2019.","Amazon; big data-driven marketing; consumer preference prediction; lifestyles segmentation; personality; recommender system; text mining","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71271099, 71571084); China Scholarship Council, CSC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71571084, No. 71271099) and China Scholarship Council.

In particular, we investigated the beneficial effect of adding the voice of customers through call center emails - i.e. textual information - to a churn-prediction system that only uses traditional marketing information. We found that adding unstructured, textual information into a conventional churn-prediction model resulted in a significant increase in predictive performance. From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to better identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Yet the way in which market-oriented firms seek to achieve superior rents is substantively different from that of entrepreneurially oriented firms which could lead to differential impacts of EO and MO on firm risk. In this study, the authors employ a text mining technique to assess firms' EO and MO and examine the impact of these two strategic orientations on shareholder risk outcomes. The results show that while EO increases idiosyncratic risk, MO decreases it. However, only EO decreases systematic risk. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that a firm's decisions regarding strategic orientation should be examined in light of both likely risks and returns in order to make appropriate resource allocation decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm risk; Market orientation; Shareholder return; Text analysis","","","","","","","","Adhikari B.K., Agrawal A., Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?, Journal of Corporate Finance, 38, pp. 272-293, (2016); Aiken L.S., West S.G., Reno R.R., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Amit R., Schoemaker P.J., Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Andersen T.J., Denrell J., Bettis R.A., Strategic responsiveness and Bowman's risk–return paradox, Strategic Management Journal, 28, 4, pp. 407-429, (2007); Anderson E.W., Mansi S.A., Does customer satisfaction matter to investors?

The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; Green hotels; Machine learning techniques; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neuro-fuzzy; Satisfaction; Sustainable development; TOPSIS","Malaysia; cluster analysis; data mining; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; service quality; sustainable development; World Wide Web","","","","","Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, (LYC18-02, Xq18A01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771156, 71971145)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71771156 and 71971145, and the 2018 Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, grant number Xq18A01 and LYC18-02","Rahman I., Reynolds D., The influence of values and attitudes on green consumer behavior: A conceptual model of green hotel patronage, Int.

Monitoring this reputation in the public sector may bring several benefits for its institutions, especially in supporting decision-making and developing marketing campaigns. Thus, to offer a solution aimed at the needs of this sector, the goal of this research was to develop a methodology capable of extracting relevant information about eWOM in social media, using text mining and natural language processing techniques. Our goal was achieved through a methodology capable of handling the small amount of information regarding public state organizations in social media. Additionally, our work was validated using the context of the Portuguese Army and revealed the potential to provide indicators of institutional reputation. Our results present one of the first cases of the application of this type of techniques to an Army organization and to understand its negative reputation among the population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","eWOM; Public sector; Reputation; Social media; Voluntary service","Decision making; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social aspects; Decisions makings; EWOM; Marketing campaign; Public institution; Public opinions; Public sector; Reputation; Social media; Social media platforms; Voluntary service; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Aggarwal C., An introduction to social network data analytics, (2011); Anagnostopoulou S., Buhalis D., Kountouri I., Manousakis E., Tsekrekos A., The impact of online reputation on hotel profitability, Int J Contemp Hosp Manag, 32, pp. 20-39, (2020); Anderson E., Customer satisfaction and word of mouth, J Serv Res, (1998); Aramendia-Muneta M., Spread the word-the effect of word of mouth in e-marketing, Commercial communication in the digital age information or disinformation, pp. 227-245, (2017); Ash S., Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments, Groups, leadership and men; research in human relations, pp. 177-190, (1951); Augusto M., Torres P., Effects of brand attitude and eWOM on consumers willingness to pay in the banking industry: mediating role of consumer-brand identification and brand equity, J Retail Consum Serv, 42, pp. 1-10, (2018); Banerjee A., A simple model of herd behavior, Q J Econ, 107, 3, pp. 797-817, (1992); Barnett M., Jermier J., Lafferty B., Corporate reputation: the definitional landscape, Corp Reput Rev, 9, pp. 538-541, (2006); Cheung C., Thadani D., The impact of electronic word-of-mouth communication: a literature analysis and integrative model, Decis Support Syst, 54, pp. 461-470, (2012); Christopher M., Payne A., Ballantyne D., Relationship marketing: integrating quality, customer service and marketing, Relationship marketing, pp. 148-189, (2002); Constantinides E., Foundations of social media marketing, Procedia Soc Behav Sci, 148, pp. 40-57, (2014); Fernandez-Gavilanes M., Juncal-Martinez J., Garcia-Mendez S., Costa-Montenegro E., Gonzalez-Castano F.J., Creating emoji lexica from unsupervised sentiment analysis of their descriptions, Expert Syst Appl, 103, pp. 74-91, (2018); Gurau C., Integrated online marketing communication: implementation and management, J Commun Manag, 12, 2, pp. 169-184, (2008); Hand D., Statistics and data mining: intersecting disciplines, ACM SIGKDD Explor Newsl, 1, pp. 16-19, (1999); He W., Wu H., Yan G., Akula V., Shen J., A novel social media competitive analytics framework with sentiment benchmarks, Inf Manag, 52, 7, pp. 801-812, (2015); Hennig-Thurau T., Gwinner K., Walsh G., Gremler D., Electronic word-of-mouth via consumer-opinion platforms: what motivates consumers to articulate themselves on the internet?, J Interact Mark, 18, pp. 38-52, (2004); Hoye G., Lievens F., Social influences on organizational attractiveness: investigating if and when word of mouth matters, J Appl Soc Psychol, 37, 9, pp. 38-52, (2007); Jalilvand M., Esfahani S., Samiei N., Word of mouth, online consumer, consumer behavior, Procedia Comput Sci, 3, pp. 42-46, (2011); Jansen B., Zhang M., Sobel K., Chowdury A., Micro-blogging as online word of mouth branding, CHI 09 extended abstracts on human factors in computing systems, pp. 3859-3864, (2009); Kaplan A., Haenlein M., Users of the world, unite!

Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon. © 2022 The Authors","Deep Contextual Language Models; Machine Learning; Meta-Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Transfer Learning","","","","","","Claussen-Simon-Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (460037581, HE 6703/1–2)","This work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) research unit 1452, HE 6703/1–2, and by research grant number 460037581.

It is essential for managers to gain a confident understanding of their business environments in order to make successful decisions. With the growth of opinion-rich web resources such as social media, discussion forums, review sites, news corpora, and blogs available on the internet, product and service reviews have become an essential source of information. In a data-driven world, they will improve services and operational insights to achieve real business benefits and help enterprises remain competitive. Despite the prevalence of textual data, few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of real-time text mining and reporting tools in firms and organizations. To address this aspect of decision-making, we have developed and evaluated an unsupervised learning system to automatically extract and classify topics and their emotion score in text streams. Data were collected from commercial websites, open-access databases, and social networks to train the model. In the experiment, the polarity score was quantified at four different levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and the entire text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using subjective data mining, we demonstrate how to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of information from the Web and help traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to capture more information. An opinion tracking system presented by our model extracts subjective information, classifies them, and tracks opinions by utilizing location, time, and reviewers’ positions. Using the online-offline data collection technique, we can update the library topic in real-time to provide users with a market opinion tracker. For marketing or economic research, this approach may be useful.

This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques. Both theoretical and practical implications are provided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","E-commerce; Priming theory; Session-based recommendation; Text mining","Commerce; Data mining; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Marketing; Product design; Across time; Key elements; Learning models; Learning techniques; Multiple user; Priming theory; Product information; Session-based recommendation; Text-mining; User sessions; Taps","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST 108-2410-H-027-020, MOST 109-2218-E-002-016, MOST 109-2410-H-027 -009 -MY2)","The authors are very grateful to the anonymous referees and Editor for their helpful comments and valuable suggestions for improving the earlier version of the paper.

This has made large amount of textual data freely available on the internet for competitive intelligence analysis, which is helping reposition more and more companies for better profit. In order to carry out competitive intelligence, financial institutions need to take note of and analyse their competitor's social media sites. This paper, therefore, aims to help the banking industry in Nigeria understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge, which will form the foundation for decision-making and internet marketing of such institutions. The study describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyse unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the five largest and leading financial institutions (banks) in Nigeria: Zenith Bank, First Bank, United Bank for Africa, Access Bank and GTBank.

The dataset for this research was collected from the complete Twitter timelines of ten academic libraries. The total dataset comprised 23,707 tweets with 17,848 mentions, 7625 hashtags, and 5974 retweets. Academic libraries from the dataset have typically posted fewer than 50 tweets per month, though tweet volume grew rapidly in late-2013 through 2014. The results show variance between academic libraries in distribution of tweets over time. The most frequent word was ""open,"" which was used in a variety of contexts by the academic libraries. It was noted that the most frequent bi-gram (two-word sequence) in the aggregated tweets was ""special collections"". The most frequent tri-gram (three-word sequence) was ""save the date"". The most frequent word categories in the semantic analysis for most libraries were related to ""knowledge, insight, and information concerning personal and cultural relations"". The most common category of the tweets was ""Resources"" among all the selected academic libraries. These findings highlight the importance of using data- and text-mining approaches in understanding the aggregate social data of academic libraries to aid in decision-making and strategic planning for patron outreach and marketing of services. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Academic libraries; Content analysis; Data mining; Social media; Text mining; Twitter","","","","","","","","Abrahams A., Fan W., Wang G., Zhang Z., Jiao J., An integrated text analytic framework for product defect discovery, Production and Operations Management, 24, 6, pp. 975-990, (2015); Aharony N., Twitter use in libraries: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Web Librarianship, 4, 4, pp. 333-350, (2010); Al-Daihani S., AlAwadhi S., Exploring academic libraries' use of Twitter: A content analysis, The Electronic Library, 33, 6, pp. 1002-1015, (2015); Bird S., Loper E., Klein E., Natural language processing with Python, (2009); Boateng F., Quan Liu Y., Web 2.0 applications' usage and trends in top US academic libraries, Library Hi Tech, 32, 1, pp. 120-138, (2014); Burgert L., Nann A., Sterling L., Ventures in social media, Codex: The Journal of the Louisiana Chapter of the ACRL, 3, 1, pp. 20-44, (2014); Cavanagh M.F., Micro-blogging practices in Canadian public libraries: A national snapshot, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, (2015); Chu S., Du H., Social networking tools for academic libraries, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 45, 1, pp. 64-75, (2013); Collins G., Quan-Haase A., Are social media ubiquitous in academic libraries?

The present study discusses the central and peripheral sources of influence, such as the content of the review, star rating, review length, and the total number of votes on the perceived usefulness of the review. It analyses reviews from Amazon.com on three products, namely, a videogame, digital music, and a grocery item. Using text mining, the study uncovers sentiment polarity, identifies sentiment patterns, and finally, analyses the perceived usefulness of reviews under the moderation effect. The study establishes that the impact of the central route is not significant for search goods. The study concludes that peripheral sources have a significant impact on the search products. Our study provides insights on how marketing strategies can be formulated by online retailers based on the product type. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Electronic word of mouth; Online customer review; Peripheral;

However, the abundance of user-generated content data makes it challenging to analyze and derive insights from it. As a result, the demand for sentiment analysis research has increased. This work intends to highlight the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis through a bibliometric analysis. To our knowledge, bibliometric research of sentiment analysis on user-generated content has never been conducted. The research methodology adopted for this study was essentially divided into four phases. Those phases include data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis and report writing. This bibliometric research successfully identified the trends and state of the art in user-generated content sentiment analysis. This study will give a baseline for future researchers to start another study. Big data, text analytics, text mining, tourism, covid-19, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, making predictions, and marketing decisions are among the most recent research interests for sentiment analysis of user-generated content. However, there is a lack of research on those particular topics. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

Design/methodology/approach: Biblioshiny and VOSviewer applications are employed for the bibliometric analysis and visualisation, respectively. Findings: The most influential documents, authors, affiliations, countries and journals are presented. Citation, Co-citation and keyword co-occurrence analysis is conducted and presented in the form of a clustered network diagram. Practical implications: This paper found three main themes of the research in consumer behaviour amid Covid-19 a) Food purchasing decisions and food wastage, b) Adoption of technology and c) Intrinsic and extrinsic influence on consumer behaviour. Social implications: The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the world’s economy and left behind its adverse effect on almost every walk of life. Consumer behaviour is no exception, studies have reported paradigm shifts in the way consumers are reacting to marketing stimuli, making purchase and consumption decisions.

However, the drivers of such decisions remain underexplored. This study identifies a significant predictor of strategic emphasis, namely, corporate managerial hubris, and reveals some of its boundary conditions. Leveraging a unique dataset based on text mining of press releases issued by over 400 firms across 13 years, the authors demonstrate that high corporate managerial hubris predicts low strategic emphasis on advertising relative to R&D. However, this effect is mitigated significantly by firm maturity, corporate governance, and industry-level strategic emphasis. The results provide novel insights into the effects of hubris on firm spending, the situations wherein marketing decisions tend to be subject to managers’ psychological bias, the means of preventing over- or under-investment in marketing strategy, and the recruitment and training of managers. © The Author(s) 2017.","Advertising; Corporate managerial hubris; R&d; Strategic emphasis","","","","","","University of Massachusetts Boston; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, HUFS; Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, UNIST","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the 2017 Research Fund (1.170022.01) of UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund of 2016.

In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice. © 2013 INFORMS.","Brand community; Communication mode; Conometric modeling; Consumer behavior; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content","Commerce; Data mining; Economics; Elasticity; Joining; Marketing; Purchasing; Sales; Social networking (online); Brand community; Communication mode; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content; Consumer behavior","","","","","","","Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer pur-chase behavior, J.
