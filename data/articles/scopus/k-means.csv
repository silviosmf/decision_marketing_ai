This study aims to cluster micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Garut Regency based on their similarity of attributes attached to the factors. These aspects include a taxpayer identification ownership, business license ownership, total net worth, total capital, number of employees, total business volume, product certification, product license, and brand. Clusterization has an important urgency for the development of MSMEs. Clustering can help group MSMEs into groups that are easier to analyze and make the right decisions to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of MSMEs. In addition, the application of clustering for MSMEs can have positive implications such as identifying the characteristics of MSMEs, developing appropriate marketing strategies, improving product or service quality, collaboration and information exchange, and access to resources. This can help MSMEs to increase their efficiency and competitiveness in the market. After data screening, the sample of MSMEs was analyzed using K-means clustering analysis and the help of RapidMiner 5.3 software. There were six iterations conducted before the data position value was stable, with the results revealing three MSME clusters. Cluster 2 had the highest percentage of MSMEs, with 84%. Cluster 1 had a higher percentage of MSMEs with ownership of business license numbers than Clusters 2 and 3. Cluster 3 had a larger and more significant number of MSMEs and a larger total net worth and ownership of product and brand licenses than the other clusters, while Cluster 2 showed an intermediate profile in almost all factors. The study results provide an overview of the local government in adopting cluster formation policies in Garut Regency.

The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy. After applying the decomposition part, the results have RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values of 49.59%, 22.58%, and 21.99% lower than those of the individual prediction part, respectively. This research presents a novel approach for market participants in the soybean industry for risk response. It gives a new perspective on agricultural product prices in sustainable agricultural marketing, while also providing practical tools for developing public policies and decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","CEEMDAN; CNN-GRU-Attention; fuzzy entropy; soybean spot price","China; cluster analysis; entropy; fuzzy mathematics; soybean; sustainability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71573042, 71973028)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 71573042 and 71973028.","Yao H., Zuo X., Zuo D., Lin H., Huang X., Zang C., Study on soybean potential productivity and food security in China under the influence of COVID-19 outbreak, Geogr.

Understanding these values and also the conditions in which these values are shaped will help in targeting marketing effort. Design/methodology/approach – The hierarchical and K/means cluster analyses were instrumental in identifying different migrant clusters. Planned contrasts were employed to compare related pairs of clusters. The logistic regression analysis identified several determinants of cluster membership likelihood. Findings – Four different internal migrant clusters are identified in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. These are Material Success Seekers, Community/Environment Folks, Apathetics, and All/rounders. The former two express a fragmentalist lifestyle. Material Success Seekers emphasise regional business opportunities while being indifferent to social and natural resources. In contrast, Community/Environment Folks emphasise social and natural resources while maintaining indifference to business opportunities. In turn, the latter two clusters make up a holistic lifestyle: All/rounders consider all three major characteristics of the region to be important while apathetics totally deemphasise these characteristics. The planned contrasts show that demographics are instrumental in predicting differences between related clusters but not helpful in distinguishing the identified lifestyles. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this investigation is that the important constructs used to cluster migrants are not well calibrated, although the reliability scores appear to be satisfactory. Moreover, the use of four/point importance scales does not allow attaining a greater level of construct sensitivity. The research method is unique in a sense that the cluster analysis and the planned contrasts are applied to examine contrasting values of migrant collectivities. Practical implications – A number of specific practical challenges need to be resolved by the regional decision makers in order to enhance place satisfaction by internal migrant collectivities. First, the regional and city councils will need to tailor different services, facilities, and public spaces to appeal to different requirements of migrant clusters. Second, the region's settlement support agency should provide migrants with relevant, focused, and differentiated information about available services and resources to suit their various life goals, aspirations, and values. Originality/value – This investigation tackles the problem of lacking theoretical and empirical research foundation on internal migration as a marketing phenomenon. Moreover, it is unique in its approach of conceptualising migrant segments as cultural phenomena, that is, interdependent collectivities that form on the basis of contrasting values. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cluster analysis; Immigration; Lifestyles; Market segmentation; Marketing; New Zealand","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Chakrapani C., Hernandez T., Marketing the downtown through geographically enhanced consumer segmentation, Journal of Place Management and Development, 2, 2, pp. 125-139, (2009); Ashworth G.J., Voogd H., Selling the City: Marketing Approaches in Public Sector Urban Planning, (1990); Bourdieu P., Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, (1984); De Wind J., Holdaway J., Migration and Development within and Across Borders: Research and Policy Perspectives on Internal and International Migration, (2008); Greenwood M.J., Rosenberg M.R., Stark O., Internal migration in developed countries, Handbook of Population and Family Economics, 1B, pp. 647-720, (1997); Holt D.B., Poststructuralist lifestyle analysis: conceptualizing the social patterning of consumption in postmodernity, Journal of Consumer Research, 23, 4, pp. 326-350, (1997); Jiwa S.J., Coca-Stefaniak A., Blackwell M., Rahman T., Light night: an ‘enlightening’ place marketing experience, Journal of Place Management and Development, 2, 2, pp. 154-166, (2009); Kavaratzis M., Ashworth G., Place marketing: how did we get here and where are we going?, Journal of Place Management and Development, 1, 2, pp. 150-165, (2008); Kotler P., Gertner D., Country as brand, product, and beyond: a place marketing and brand management perspective, Brand Management, 9, 4-5, pp. 249-261, (2002); Kotler P., Haider D.H., Rein I., Marketing Places: Attracting Investment, Industry, and Tourism to Cities, States, and Nations, (1993); Madsen H., Place-marketing in Liverpool: a review, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 16, pp. 633-640, (1992); Muniz A.M., O'Guinn T.C., Brand community, Journal of Consumer Research, 27, 4, pp. 412-433, (2001); Podolny J.M., Hill-Popper M., Hedonic and transcendent conceptions of value, Industrial and Corporate Change, 13, 1, pp. 91-116, (2004); Tajfel H., Human Groups and Social Categories: Studies in Social Psychology, (1981); Thompson C.J., Locander W.B., Pollio H.B., Putting consumer experience back into consumer research: the philosophy and method of existential-phenomenology, Journal of Consumer Research, 16, 2, pp. 133-146, (1989); Turner J.C., Lawler E.J., Social categorization and the self-concept: a social cognitive theory of group behaviour, Advances in Group Processes, 2, pp. 77-122, (1985); Turner J.C., Hogg M.A., Oakes P.J., Reicher S., Wetherell M.S., Rediscovering the Social Group: A Self-categorization Theory, (1987); Vargo S.L., Lusch R.F., Evolving to a new dominant logic for marketing, Journal of Marketing, 68, pp. 1-17, (2004)","","","","","","","","","17538335","","","","English","J.

A select set of environmental features was sourced from a prior study (Thorne et al. in J Gambl Issues 2016b), and a discrete choice experiment was conducted through an online survey. Using the same dataset first described by Rockloff et al. (EGM Environments that contribute to excess consumption and harm, 2015), a sample of 245 EGM gamblers were sourced from clubs in Victoria, Australia, and 7516 gamblers from an Australian national online survey-panel. Participants’ choices amongst sets of hypothetical gambling environments allowed for an estimation of the implied individual-level utilities for each feature (e.g., general sounds, location, etc.). K-means clustering on these utilities identified four unique market segments for EGM gambling, representing four different types of consumers. The segments were named according to their dominant features: Social, Value, High Roller and Internet. We found that the environments orientated towards the Social and Value segments were most conducive to attracting players with relatively few gambling problems, while the High Roller and Internet-focused environments had greater appeal for players with problems and vulnerabilities. This study has generated new insights into the kinds of gambling environments that are most consistent with safe play. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","EGM; Fruit; Pokie; Slot","Adult; Anxiety; Behavior, Addictive; Choice Behavior; Female; Gambling; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Reward; Risk-Taking; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Victoria; Video Games; consumer; fruit; gambling; human; Internet; machine; marketing; sound; Victoria; addiction; adult; anxiety; decision making; female; high risk behavior; male; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; reward; self report; video game","","","","","Foundation.; Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation; Treasury; Ministry of Health, New Zealand","Acknowledgements This research was supported by a Grant from the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation.

The literature regarding consumer decision-making styles when purchasing digital products is rather scarce. Therefore, a research study on behavioral patterns and product attri-butes important to consumers when they purchase digital goods might contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this type of consumer behavior while also broadening the existing body of knowledge. Design/Methodology/Approach – Empirical data were collected using an online questionnaire consist-ing of items borrowed from the relevant literature and adapted to the research context. Research results are presented using descriptive statistics, exploratory fac-tor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and k-means cluster analysis. Findings and implications – This study has revealed four distinct consumer groups that differ in their consumer decision-making styles when buying digital products. Both theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings are discussed. Results of this research serve as helpful insights into consumer behavior characteristics in a digital products market, providing digital goods companies with valuable inputs for planning their marketing strategies and activities. Limitations – The results of the present research apply to digital products in general. Future research should develop and confirm these initial findings further by incorporating specific digital product categories and fo-cusing on other socio-cultural contexts. Originality – By identifying six consumer decision-mak-ing styles and four distinct clusters, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of consumer approaches when buying digital products, thereby broadening the existing theoretical knowledge of consumer decision-making styles. © 2022, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

Toosi University of Technology, Iran","In today’s fast moving world of marketing from product-orientation to customer-orientation, the management of customer treatment can be seen as a key to achieve revenue growth and profitability. Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance. Most customer segmentation approaches based on customer value fail to account for the factor of time and the trend of value changes in their analysis. In this article, we classify customers based on their value using the RFM model and K-means clustering method. Then, an assessment of changes over several periods of time is carried out. The originality of this research lies in its incorporation of time and trend of customer value changes in improving the accuracy of predictions based on the past behavior of customers. For this purpose, we used the POS customer transactions. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Customer lifetime value; RFM model; Segmentation; Temporal data mining","","","","","","","","Bauer C.L., A direct mail customer purchase model, Journal of Direct Marketing, 2, 3, pp. 16-24, (1988); Berson A., Smith S., Thearling K., Building Data Mining Applications for CRM, (1999); Bose I., Chen X., Quantitative models for direct marketing: A review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Bottcher M., Hoppner F., Spiliopoulou M., On exploiting the power of time in data mining, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 10, 2, pp. 3-11, (2008); Bottcher M., Spott M., Nauck D., Kruse R., Mining changing customer segments in dynamic markets, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 1, pp. 155-164, (2009); Bramer M., Principles of Data Mining, 131, (2007); Chang H.-C., Tsai H.-P., Group RFM analysis as a novel framework to discover better customer consumption behavior, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 12, pp. 14499-14513, (2011); Chang H.H., Tsay S.F., Integrating of SOM and K-Mean in data mining clustering: An empirical study of CRM and profitability evaluation, Journal of Information Management, 11, 4, pp. 161-203, (2004); Chen M.-C., Chiu A.-L., Chang H.-H., Mining changes in customer behavior in retail marketing, Expert Systems with Applications, 28, 4, pp. 773-781, (2005); Cheng C.-H., Chen Y.-S., Classifying the segmentation of customer value via RFM model and RS theory, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3, pp. 4176-4184, (2009); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Morison R., Analytics at Work: Smarter Decisions, Better Results, (2010); Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques: Concepts and Techniques, (2011); Hosseini S.M.S., Maleki A., Gholamian M.R., Cluster analysis using data mining approach to develop CRM methodology to assess the customer loyalty, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 5259-5264, (2010); Hu Y.-H., Huang T.C., Kao Y.-H., Knowledge discovery of weighted RFM sequential patterns from customer sequence databases, Journal of Systems and Software, 86, 3, pp. 779-788, (2013); Huang T.C., Mining the change of customer behavior in fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns, Applied Soft Computing, 12, 3, pp. 1068-1086, (2012); Hughes A., Strategic Database Marketing, (1994); Hwang H., Jung T., Suh E., An LTV model and customer segmentation based on customer value: A case study on the wireless telecommunication industry, Expert Systems with Applications, 26, 2, pp. 181-188, (2004); Kim S.-Y., Jung T.-S., Suh E.-H., Hwang H.-S., Customer segmentation and strategy development based on customer lifetime value: A case study, Expert Systems with Applications, 31, 1, pp. 101-107, (2006); Kotler P., Marketing Management, (2001); Yen D.C., Customer relationship management: An analysis framework and implementation strategies, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 41, 3, pp. 82-97, (2001); Liu D.-R., Shih Y.-Y., Integrating AHP and data mining for product recommendation based on customer lifetime value, Information & Management, 42, 3, pp. 387-400, (2005); Marcus C., A practical yet meaningful approach to customer segmentation, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 15, 5, pp. 494-504, (1998); Roddick J.F., Spiliopoulou M., A survey of temporal knowledge discovery paradigms and methods, Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions On, 14, 4, pp. 750-767, (2002); Song H.S., Kim S.H., Mining the change of customer behavior in an internet shopping mall, Expert Systems with Applications, 21, 3, pp. 157-168, (2001); Stone B., Successful Direct Marketing Methods, NTC Business Books, pp. 37-57, (1995); Tsai C.-Y., Chiu C.-C., A purchase-based market segmentation methodology, Expert Systems with Applications, 27, 2, pp. 265-276, (2004); Turban E., Sharda R., Aronson J.E., King D.N., Business Intelligence: a Managerial Approach, (2008); Verhoef P.C., Spring P.N., Hoekstra J.C., Leeflang P.S.H., The commercial use of segmentation and predictive modeling techniques for database marketing in the Netherlands, Decision Support Systems, 34, 4, pp. 471-481, (2003); Wei J.-T., Lin S.-Y., Wu H.-H., A review of the application of RFM model, African Journal of Business Management, 4, 19, pp. 4199-4206, (2010)","M.

Geographic information systems (GIS) provide solutions that allow the understanding and understanding of market problems (Geomarketing) and help the decision-making process by allowing the treatment and geographical analysis of these data and criteria. However, GIS involves resources such as people, equipment and maintenance which are not always available. Web-based GIS (WebGIS) can offer the same GIS solutions but require less resources. However, studies show that WebGIS has not been used to its full potential, limited to the geovisualization of points of interest. We propose a Geomarketing WebGIS to solve a classic problem of geographic-market decision. Operated by a two-stage method and spatial analysis (k-means, Voronoi diagram, weighted midpoint, and kernel density function), Geomarketing WebGIS uses potential customer data to show a set of store-branches and the parent-store location. Through simulation, we show that the Geomarketing WebGIS can go beyond the geovisualization and offer solution to a relevant problem of the literature without the restrictions found in the GIS. These findings help to reaffirm that WebGIS: i) has the potential to solve complex geographic problems; ii) have features and resources such as GIS but maintained and operated with fewer resources; and iii) favor the geographic thinking. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from a sample of 508 hotel guests who had stayed in a hotel in the past 12 months via a self-administered survey on Qualtrics survey software. The analysis of the study consisted of two main research steps: identification of cluster groups via the K-means cluster analysis algorithm and discriminant analysis; and performing a series of chi-square analyses to determine whether hotel guests’ characteristics and attitudes vary according to obtained hotel guest typologies. Findings: Results indicated significant attitudinal (e.g. internet payment preference) and demographic (e.g. age) differences among the obtained hotel guest typologies regarding their attitudes toward GRTs. Practical implications: The results provide valuable guidance and a pragmatic approach for those hotel managers that aim to generate tailored marketing strategies for guest segments that are interested in GRTs. Originality/value: This study concentrates on GRTs with a market segmentation approach by using advanced statistical procedures. It contributes to the body of related research literature by offering empirical evidence where the study evaluates the impact of the availability of new GRTs on guest decision-making based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior. Practitioners will be able to use the presented findings to generate marketing and pricing strategies with respect to the technological needs and wants of each typology. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Guest-room technology; Hotel technology; In-room technology; Market segmentation; Willingness to pay","","","","","","","","Lodging approval requirements and diamond rating guidelines, (2018); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Perceived behavioral control, self‐efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32, 4, pp. 665-683, (2002); Beldona S., Cobanoglu C., Importance-performance analysis of guest technologies in the lodging industry, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 48, 3, pp. 299-312, (2007); Beldona S., Schwartz Z., Zhang X., Evaluating hotel guest technologies: does home matter?, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 5, pp. 2327-2342, (2018); Bilgihan A., A study of accepted pricing points for in-room entertainment technology amenities by guests, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 3, 1, pp. 24-31, (2012); Bilgihan A., Wang Y., Technology induced competitive advantage: a case of US lodging industry, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 7, 1, pp. 37-59, (2016); Bilgihan A., Cobanoglu C., Miller B.L., Importance-performance analysis of guest entertainment technology amenities in the lodging industry, FIU Review, 28, 3, pp. 84-108, (2010); Bilgihan A., Smith S., Ricci P., Bujisic M., Hotel guest preferences of in-room technology amenities, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 7, 2, pp. 118-134, (2016); Brochado A., Rita P., Margarido A., High tech meets high touch in upscale hotels, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 7, 4, pp. 347-365, (2016); Cobanoglu C., Berezina K., Kasavana M.L., Erdem M., The impact of technology amenities on hotel guest overall satisfaction, Journal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality and Tourism, 12, 4, pp. 272-288, (2011); U.S. digital future in focus 2014, (2014); Deeb W.E., Murray I., Hotel guests and their expectations for technology in the guest room, Administrative Sciences Association of Canada (ASAC) Conference, (2002); US digital users: eMarketer's estimates for 2018, (2018); Enz C., What keeps you up at night?

We segment households based on their elasticities of response to several marketing variables: price, promotion, and advertising using a k-means clustering algorithm. Describing each of these segments according to their demographic attributes provides the type of information required to target particular groups of similar consumers, which in turn allows for a much more effective and efficient use of scarce marketing dollars. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Breusch T., Pagan A., A simple test for heteroscedasticity and random parameter variation, Econometrica, 47, pp. 1287-1294, (1979);

Further, the authors investigate the moderating role of three categories of visitors – direct, hesitant and hedonic – in the relationship between product information diversity and consumer decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilizes a sample of 1,101,062 product click streams from 4,200 consumers. Visitors are clustered using the k-means algorithm. The diversity of information recommendations for single and multi-category products is characterized using granularity and dispersion, respectively. Empirical analysis is conducted to examine their influence on the two-stage decision-making process of heterogeneous online visitors. Findings: The study reveals that the impact of recommended information diversity on consumer decision making differs significantly between single-category and multiple-category products. Specifically, information diversity in single-category products enhances consumers' click and purchase intention, while information diversity in multiple-category products reduces consumers' click and purchase intention. Moreover, based on the analysis of online visiting heterogeneity, hesitant, direct and hedonic features enhance the positive impact of granularity on consumer decision making; while direct features exacerbate the negative impact of dispersion on consumer decision making. Originality/value: First, the article provides support for studies related to information cocoon. Second, the research contributes evidence to support the information overload theory. Third, the research enriches the field of precision marketing theory. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer decision making; Information diversity; Online marketing; Online visitor heterogeneity; Recommender systems","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and “14th Five-Year Plan” (2021) Fund Project of Social Sciences in Jiangxi Province (Grant number 72272072, 21GL01).

Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods","","","","","","","","Birant D, Data mining using RFM analysis, Knowledge-oriented applications in data mining (IntechOpen), (2011); Chang CJ, A Decision Support System for Audit Staff Scheduling of Multiple and Large-Scaled Engagements, Rev Bus Inf Syst, 6, pp. 27-40, (2002); De Haan E, Wiesel T, Pauwels K, The effectiveness of different forms of online advertising for purchase conversion in a multiple-channel attribution framework, Int J Res Mark, 33, pp. 491-507, (2016); Dodin B, Huang Chan K, Application of production scheduling methods to external and internal audit scheduling, Eur J Oper Res, 52, pp. 267-279, (1991); Edvardsson B, Gustafsson A, Roos I, Service portraits in service research: a critical review, International J Serv Ind Manage, 16, pp. 107-121, (2005); Grewala D, Roggeveen AL, Understanding Retail Experiences and Customer Journey Management, J Retailing, 96, pp. 3-8, (2020); Han DL, Tang LC, Huang HC, A Markov model for single-leg air cargo revenue management under a bid-price policy, Eur J Oper Res, 200, pp. 800-811, (2010); He B, Shi Y, Wan Q, Et al., Prediction of customer attrition of commercial banks based on SVM model, Pro Comput Sci, 31, pp. 423-430, (2014); Huang CY, Shen YC, Chiang IP, Et al., Characterizing Web users’ online information behavior, J Am Society Inf Sci Technol, 58, pp. 1988-1997, (2007); Klein R, Sebastian K, Steinhardt C, Et al., A review of revenue management: Recent generalizations and advances in industry applications, Eur J Oper Res, 284, pp. 397-412, (2020); Kraus M, Feuerriegel S, Oztekin A, Deep learning in business analytics and operations research: Models, applications and managerial implications, Eur J Oper Res, 281, pp. 628-641, (2020); Lemon KN, Verhoef PC, Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey, J Mark, 80, (2016); Mainak S, Bruyn AD, LSTM Response Models for Direct Marketing Analytics: Replacing Feature Engineering with Deep Learning, J Interact Mark, 53, pp. 80-95, (2021); Strauss AK, Klein R, Steinhardt C, A review of choice-based revenue management: Theory and methods, Eur J Oper Res, 271, pp. 375-387, (2018); Sun C, Adamopoulos P, Ghose A, Et al., Predicting stages in omnichannel path to purchase: A deep learning model, Inf Syst Res, 33, pp. 429-445, (2022)","T.-C.

This exploratory study examines the shopping orientation of Gen Z online shoppers using the generational cohort theory (GCT) as a framework and provides insights to e-retailers to understand how this generation approaches the online shopping. The penetration of Internet and accelerated growth of online shopping have enthused the e-retailers to offer a wide range of goods at greater efficiency than the traditional players. By cluster analysis (K-means) of nine online shopping orientation factors (two were eliminated prior due to low factor loading scores), four segments were identified: (a) ‘Economic-quality seekers’, (b) ‘Convenience shoppers’, (c) ‘Deal hunting-convenience seekers’ and (d) ‘Brand and quality conscious shoppers’, and the study profiled each segment based on the demographic data through chi-square analysis. Finally, implications for online retailers and marketing practitioners are enumerated towards the end of the article. © 2019 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","Asia; consumer behaviour;

Many variable-selection procedures are available for clustering, and some have exhibited good performance in simulation studies. Unfortunately, the best-performing methods often fail because they emphasize the clustering power of individual variables. For this reason, we recommend extreme caution when using the existing procedures, and we argue that enumeration of all-possible variable subsets is a preferred strategy. We also address a common decision problem—the selection of the number of clusters—and develop an index which can help guide the joint selection of variables and clusters. By way of an empirical example, we illustrate the variable-selection problem and demonstrate the use of the proposed index to jointly select variables and clusters in K-means partitioning. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","K-means clustering;

Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted among employees of industrial companies operating in Belarus. Two hundred thirty-eight responses were analyzed by using the K-means cluster analysis. The analysis of variance was applied for evaluating differences between the three identified clusters. Findings: Based on internal brand commitment and sustainability importance, the paper identifies three alternative clusters of employees: uncommitted sustainability laggards, committed sustainability followers and committed sustainability leaders. The results show that the three clusters differ in regard to the main determinants of internal brand commitment, which are brand orientation, internal brand knowledge and internal brand involvement. The findings demonstrate significant perceptual differences between the three clusters regarding their evaluations of a company’s sustainability performance. The assessment of sustainability performance focuses on sustainability objectives, sustainability policies and sustainability decision-making and disclosure. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in the context of a transition economy. Future studies are recommended to develop a cross-cultural comparison of relationships between employees’ perceptions about sustainability performance, different determinants and the outcomes of internal brand commitment. Originality/value: The paper makes a theoretical contribution to research on internal branding and sustainability by examining the potential interrelationships between internal branding strategies and sustainability performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Internal branding; Internal marketing; Sustainability; Transition economy","","","","","","","","Aggerholm H.K., Andersen S.E., Thomsen C., Conceptualising employer branding in sustainable organisations, Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 16, 2, pp. 105-123, (2011); Ahmed P.K., Rafiq M., Internal marketing issues and challenges, European Journal of Marketing, 37, 9, pp. 1177-1186, (2003); Ashforth B.E., Mael F., Social identity theory and the organization, Academy of Management Review, 14, 1, pp. 20-39, (1989); Banerjee S.B., Corporate environmental strategies and actions, Management Decision, 39, 1, pp. 36-44, (2001); Banerjee S.B., Corporate environmentalism: the construct and its measurement, Journal of Business Research, 55, 3, pp. 177-191, (2002); Baumgarth C., Living the brand: brand orientation in the business-to-business sector, European Journal of Marketing, 44, 5, pp. 653-671, (2010); Baumgarth C., Schmidt M., How strong is the business-to-business brand in the workforce?

This study has proposed a brand new and practical fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) based weighted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model for application in K-means algorithm for auto insurance customers' segmentation. The developed methodology has been implemented for a private auto insurance company in Iran which classified customers into four ""best"", ""new"", ""risky"", and ""uncertain"" patterns. Then, association rules among auto insurance services in two most valuable customer segments including ""best"" and ""risky"" patterns are discovered and proposed. Finally, some marketing strategies based on the research results are proposed. The authors believe the result of this paper can provide a noticeable capability to the insurer company in order to assess its customers' loyalty in marketing strategy.

The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method - decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies. © This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Asymmetry factors; Country clustering; Marketing strategy; Supranational policy; Tourism","","","","","","","","Algieri B., Aquino A., Succurro M., Drivers of comparative advantages in tourism: The EU-case, Annals of Tourism Research, 61, pp. 247-250, (2016); Amaral R., Serra J., Back to the Same Place of Holidays.

The classification of users is significant to product improvement, precision marketing, and driving recommendations. This study proposed a method which includes four aspects: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing; (3) data analysis—a two-stage hybrid user classification, and (4) distribution fitting method. A two-stage hybrid user classification method is used to cluster traditional vehicle users. First, the first-stage classification of the classification method extracts the daily typical time–mileage-series travel patterns (TMTP) to obtain user driving time characteristics. This first-stage classification also extracts the mean and standard deviation of the daily vehicle mileage traveled (DVMT) to express user driving demands. Next, users are divided by K-means based on the driving time characteristics and driving demands from the first stage. Finally, a three-parameter log-normal distribution is used to fit the DVMT of different user types. Comparison with traditional clustering based on the mean and standard deviation and the proportion of each vehicle’s time series in the TMTP types, this study reveals that the new methods provide significant advantages in analyzing driving behavior and high reference value for enterprises making electric vehicle driving range recommendations, car market segmentation, and policy making decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach - In a study of buyers and consumers of beef in Brazil, segments based on three approaches were derived by hierarchical cluster analysis, fine-tuned by K-means cluster analysis. The outcome was evaluated for the viability and actionability of the preferred procedure, both objectively and through interviews with managers in the beef-supply business. Findings - The results revealed that a segmentation scheme combining benefits sought and features available yields more homogeneous and actionable segments, and has real promise as an input to the formulation and implementation of supply-chain strategy. Research limitations/implications - This promising innovation in market segmentation requires further study, and testing in the marketplace. Practical implications - The proposed system is a usable aid to decision making. Originality/value - The paper proposes an original approach to market segmentation.","Brazil; Market segmentation; Marketing planning; Marketing strategy; Supply chain management","","","","","","","","Bagozzi R.P., Dholakia U., Goal-setting and goal-striving in consumer behavior, Journal of Marketing, 63, SPEC.

Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns. This paper discusses the use of the data mining concept on marketing. This paper aims to analyze marketing data with k-means data mining clustering techniques and to find the relationship between marketing and k-means data mining clustering techniques. © 2022 Russian Association of Forensic Medical Experts.

Research design, data and methodology: This quantitative research utilizes data-mining techniques and the RFM model to cluster a university's provider schools. The RFM model was modified by adapting its variables to the university's marketing context and adding a district's potential (D) variable based on heatmap analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) and K-means clustering. The K-prototype algorithm and the Elbow method were applied to find provider school clusters using the proposed RFM-D model. After profiling the clusters, the target segment was assigned. The model was validated using empirical data from an Indonesian university, and its performance was compared to the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)-based RFM utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. Results: This research identified five clusters. The target segment was chosen from the highest-value and high-value clusters that comprised 17.80% of provider schools but can contribute 75.77% of students. Conclusions: The proposed model recommended more targeted schools in higher-potential districts and predicted the target segment with 0.99 accuracies, outperforming the CLV-based model. The empirical findings help university management determine the promotion location and allocate resources for promotional information distribution and student recruitment. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://Creat¡vecommons.org/l¡censes/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Information distribution; Rfm; Spatial analysis; Student recruitment; Target market","","","","","","","","Abbasimehr H., Shabani M., A new methodology for customer behavior analysis using time series clustering: A case study on a bank’s customers, Kybernetes, 50, 2, pp. 221-242, (2019); Babaiyan V., Sarfarazi S.

The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this article is to handle this issue by proposing a managerial framework- named FIRM- for firm profiling, which offers the strategic shift toward mass customization concept. The aim is to provide a tool for executives, which helps them discuss strengths and weaknesses in the internal production and information technology areas before utilizing these policies. Design/methodology/approach- The research procedure consists of measurement scales generation, data gathering, purification phase, firm clustering and profiling. Using Delphi method and brainstorming sessions, a questionnaire is developed, pretested and administered for a firm's profiling in today's marketing and production environment. Findings- A validation test of FIRM is presented and satisfactory levels of Cronbach's α are obtained at the end of the purification process. The results lead us to believe that the five-dimension structure of FIRM may be reduced to a four-dimension construct. Using k-means cluster analysis results, three different groups of firms are founded. We claim that FIRM would help strategic decision-makers to identify the particular policies and configurations necessary for their business. Clear directions on how to manage customization policies for each firm belonging to special cluster is provided. Originality/value- Chief organizational leaders in various kinds of industries may employ FIRM as an assessment tool to successfully utilize their knowledge and understanding of the firm and its customers. It will help them to support their customization policies. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","FIRM framework; FIRM profi lling; mass customization; strategy","","","","","","","","Pine B.J., Mass Customization: The New Frontier in Business Competition, (1993); Hart C.W.L., Mass customization: Conceptual underpinnings, opportunities and limits, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 6, 2, (1995); Kotha S., Mass customization: Implementing the emerging paradigm for competitive advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 21-24, (1995); Da Silveira G., Borenstein D., Fogliatto F.S., Mass customization: Literature review and research directions, International Journal of Production Economics, 72, 1, pp. 1-13, (2001); Piller F.T., Mass customization: Reflections on the state of the concept, International Journal of Flexible Manufacturing Systems, 16, 4 SPEC.

The study also explores how the concept of organisational readiness relates to menu decision makers’ intentions, perceived benefits and organisational characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Organisational readiness was measured by three dimensions (culture, climate and capacity). Data were derived from a survey of primary menu decision makers from 187 hotels in Ghana. Using a combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical (K-means) algorithms, the hotels were clustered into homogenous groups based on the original raw scores of hotel readiness indicators. The resultant cluster solution was then validated and profiled against relevant external variables. Findings: Analyses reveal three clusters which distinguish hotels by the degree of readiness to serve indigenous local dishes. The resultant segments differ by hotel category (star rating) as well as by the job positions and perceptions of primary menu decision makers. Unexpectedly, lower class hotels displayed significantly greater levels of organisational readiness to serve indigenous cuisines than those in the higher class category. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates that organisational readiness is related to perceived benefits and intentions. Among others, the findings advance the understanding of organisational readiness in hotels in the context of menu decision-making. Given the need to embed new practices in a fast-changing hospitality environment, insights drawn could also serve as a basis for future research. Generalisability of empirical findings may be limited by the socio-economic context as well as the study’s focus on small and medium scaled hotels. Practical implications: This paper supports hotel businesses in understanding the concept of organisational readiness and its relation to organisational characteristics and menu decision-making. By highlighting the different clusters of hotels, the findings accentuate the need for destination marketers and gastronomic tourism campaigners to target higher classed hotels and draw attention to the potential benefits of serving indigenous cuisines while addressing latent concerns. The results further underscore the role of organisational culture and the necessity for such campaign activities to be directed towards those with ample influence within the hierarchical structures of hotels. Originality/value: This is an initial attempt to examine the application of the organisational readiness concept to menu decision-making in hotels and to explore the implications for segmentation purposes. Further analysis revealed the critical role of organisational culture on menu decision-making patterns. Thus, the paper applies an important element of organisational development theory to the hotel industry and represents a valuable contribution to the scant literature on indigenous cuisines in hotel food service contexts. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culinary tourism;

Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained from a survey conducted in Erzurum in 2014. A conjoint analysis was used to determine the utilities of each level along with the relative importance of Erzurum Civil cheese attributes for measuring the consumption satisfaction as an indicator of the purchase decision and priorities of Turkish consumers. Findings – The results of the study clearly highlighted that Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction was maximized with the augmented and actual product images redesigned by a private-labelled and local-branded simple product with the highest and medium prices based on organic production techniques for heavy and light consumers, respectively. However, medium consumers appreciated the core benefit obtained from the credence quality attributes supported by the generic branded simple cheese with the lowest price purchased directly from the farmstead villages. Eventually, these marketing tactics and strategies could increase demand, maximizing the cheese consumption and satisfaction of Turkish consumers in each cluster. They could also provide greater consumption satisfaction to Turkish consumers as well as bigger marginal contributions to the market dynamics of the food supply chain. Originality/value – This study was the first research conducted on Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction of Turkish consumers using innovative approaches and brand designations, such as Protected Designation of Origin, Protected Geographical Indication, and Traditional Specialty Guaranteed in Turkey using the conjoint and k-mean cluster analyses techniques. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conjoint analysis; Erzurum Civil cheese; Fractional factorial design; Relative importance; Turkish consumer satisfaction","","","","","","","","Adanacioglu H., Albayram Z., A conjoint analysis of consumer preferences for traditional cheeses in Turkey: a case study on Tulum Cheese, Korean Journal Food Science of Animal Resources, 32, 4, pp. 458-466, (2012); Almli V.L., Ovrum A., Hersleth M., Almoy T., Naes T., Investigating individual preferences in rating and ranking conjoint experiments, Food Quality and Preference, 39, 1, pp. 28-39, (2015); ASUD, (2010); Barnes R.N., Bosworth R.C., Bailey D., Curtis K.R., Connecting sensory quality characteristics and local designations to willingness to pay for cheese at the retail level, International Food and Agribusiness Management Review, 17, 3, pp. 115-138, (2014); Braghieri A., Girolami A., Riviezzi A.M., Piazzolla N., Napolitano F., Liking of traditional cheese and consumer willingness to pay, Italian Journal of Animal Science, 13, 1, pp. 155-162, (2014); Casolani N., Greehy G.M., Fantini A., Chiodo E., McCarthy M.B., Consumer perceptions of nanotechnology applications in Italian wine, Italian Journal of Food Science, 27, 2, pp. 93-118, (2015); Cernea C., (2011); Chamorro A., Rubio S., Miranda F.J., The region-of-origin effect on purchasing preferences: the case of a multiregional designation of origin, British Food Journal, 117, 2, pp. 820-839, (2015); Fotopoulos C., Krystallis A., Are quality labels a real market advantage?

In addition, little is known about prospective students' information needs when deciding which institution to attend. As a result many tertiary institutions still use one message in one medium for all target markets. The aims of this paper are: to determine if sub-groups exist within the student recruitment market that need tailor made persuasive messages; to determine the preferred sources of information gathering for prospective students that influences their choice of tertiary institution; and to determine the information needs of prospective students that influence their decisions to select an institution of higher education. Design/methodology/approach - A stratified random sample of 19 schools was drawn, from which a total of 716 successfully completed questionnaires were used to conduct factor and cluster analyses to determine information needs and source preferences of these respondents. Findings - Ten factors under the VARCLUS procedure with high eigen values were grouped together with the following labels: university, college, employability aspects, course content, student experience, sporting aspects, financial aspects, direct sources, media sources and social sources. Five sub-groups clustered together with the K-means analysis, labelled: have lots, aspiring have lots, little direction and new lifers. Research limitations/implications - A limited amount of literature is available on the current use of media and sources by the target market. Decisions on the choice of a tertiary institution for higher education are most probably influenced by socio-economic circumstances in a developing context, like South Africa. Practical implications - An integrated and well co-ordinated media and message strategy for each of the various sub-groups should be specified for an IMC plan to be successful. Originality/value - This is one of the few research articles on media and source preferences of potential students in the Cape Metropolitan. The cluster analysis revealed five clusters of sub-groups that have specific media and source needs to make the decision on furthering studies at tertiary level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Higher education; Information media; Recruitment; South Africa; Students","","","","","","","","Bruwer J., Marketing a public higher educational institution through targeted and market research on its freshmen applicants and enrolee pools, South African Journal of Higher Education, 10, 2, pp. 20-9, (1996); Coetzee J., (2006); Cooper D.R., Schindler P.S., Marketing Research, (2006); Cosser M., Du Toit J., (2002); Davies S., Guppy N., (1997); Edelman R., (2004); Gaika N.G., (2002); Goff B., Patino V., Jackson G., Preferred information sources of high school students for community colleges and universities, Community College Journal of Research and Practice, 28, pp. 795-803, (2004); Imenda S.N., Kongolo M., (2002); Mouton J., How to Succeed in Your Master's and Doctoral Studies: A South African Guide and Resource Book, (2004); Demarcation Board M., (2006); Mzimela L., (2002); Nunnally J.C., (1967); Ramphele M., Steering by the Stars: Being Young in South Africa, (2002); Smith A.M., Some problems when adopting Churchill's paradigm for the development of service quality measurement scales, Journal of Business Research, 46, pp. 109-20, (1999); Asgisa, (2006); James R., (2002); Manuel T., (2005); Pandor N., (2005); (1998); South Africa S., Person Statistics Municipality Level, 2001, (2001); Born Free and Colour Blind","J.

Hence, adopting a mixed method approach, 17 attitudinal statements were generated through focus group discussions and were used to segment a sample of 301 urban chocolate consumers. The survey data was subjected to a K-means cluster analysis, and it revealed the existence of three distinct clusters: the innovative national; the conservative patriot; and the global seeker. Chi-square analysis was conducted to profile the three groups. Though the study was exploratory in nature, the clusters exhibited such distinct buying patterns that the results hold tremendous value not only from an academic perspective but also for chocolate manufacturers and retailers. All three groups were buying chocolates for gifting purpose, while the young innovators liked to buy for self-gifts as well. Point of sales display had maximum impact on their purchase decision. The global seeker was buying more foreign brands versus the other two, who bought chocolate brands of national origin. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","adult consumers; Chocolate consumption; cluster analysis; emerging markets; Segmentation","","","","","","","","Ahmed Z.A., Johnson J.P., Yang X., Fatt C.K., Teng H.S., Boon L.C., Does country-of-origin matter for low involvement product?, International Marketing Review, 21, pp. 102-120, (2004); Akdeniz Ar A., Kara A., Emerging market consumers’ country of production image, trust, and quality perceptions of global brands made in China, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 23, pp. 491-503, (2014); Andorfer V.A., Liebe U., Research on fair trade consumption—A review, Journal of Business Ethics, 106, pp. 415-435, (2012); Batra R., Athola O.T., Measuring the hedonic and utilitarian sources of consumer attitudes, Marketing Letters, 2, pp. 159-170, (1991); Benton D., Green Field K., Morgan M., The development of the attitudes to chocolate questionnaire, Personality and Individual Differences, 24, pp. 513-520, (1998); Bhaskaran S., Sukumaran N., National, business culture and management practices: Consequential relationships, Cross-Cultural Management, 14, pp. 54-67, (2007); Brooks R., Alienating customers isn’t always a bad idea, many firms discover, Wall Street Journal, (1999); Camgoz S.M., Ertem P.S., Should food manufacturers care about country-of-origin effect?

The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively. On the basis of the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, customers of the business have been segmented into various meaningful groups using the k-means clustering algorithm and decision tree induction, and the main characteristics of the consumers in each segment have been clearly identified. Accordingly a set of recommendations is further provided to the business on consumer-centric marketing.

Additionally, recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM) analysis method is suitable for identifying valuable bank customers. Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns hidden in customer data. However, in previous research, data mining has been used separately in both credit scoring and RFM approaches. To evaluate customer behaviour, banks must employ credit scoring and RFM analysis method, simultaneously. This study proposes a framework for using data mining techniques to integrate credit scoring and RFM methods in the field of banking. In this framework, k-means had better performance than Kohonen network and DBSCAN to identify and cluster valuable customers based on the RFM and credit scoring indices. Moreover, the C5 decision tree, BN, and SVM with 94.10%, 92.71%, and 92.36% accuracy had better performance to classify valuable bank customers based on RFM and credit scoring indices.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper exhibits two different models which shed light on the perceived value of each examined area of study: conjoint analysis and clustering k-means algorithm. Findings: The findings of the used methods exhibit not only which of the attributes have the greatest influence on students’ decision-making process, but also shed light on which types of study areas are most preferred by respondents. Originality/value: The paper addresses a new view on students’ definition of higher education when adding the choice of selecting the “proper” area of study to one’s profile. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Area of study; Conjoint analysis; Decision support systems and marketing; Higher education and preferences","","","","","","","","Alexouda G., An evolutionary algorithm approach to the share of choices problem in the product line design, Computers and Operations Research, 31, 13, pp. 2215-2229, (2003); Balakrishnan P.V., Jacob V.S., Triangulation in decision support systems: algorithms for product design, Decision Support Systems, 14, 4, pp. 313-327, (1995); Balakrishnan P.V., Jacob V.S., Genetic algorithm for product design, Management Science, 42, 8, pp. 1105-1117, (1996); Gambetta D., Were they Pushed or Did they Jump?

Benefit segmentation is one of the best approaches for market segmentation among others. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid benefit segmentation approach which applied two-stage clustering, conjoint analysis, and Delphi technique to segment customers according to their benefits. More precisely, we used two-stage clustering based on main benefits derived from conjoint analysis to classify customers into different segments. Conjoint analysis was used to assess and balance dissimilar aspects of consumers needs. Delphi method was used for the selection of the most important criteria and their levels which conjoint analysis required all of them for evaluation. This approach did not only help managers to segment customers but also to provide a way to analyse consumer behaviour, determine the marking strategy and extract the importance of each attribute in each segment. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Benefit segmentation;

This technique has been successfully applied to diverse large manufacturers and wholesale retailers. However, it remains a challenging task to directly employ the CM technique in convenience store (CVS) chain(s). This is because CVS chains are often distributed in a variety of areas, each store has impulsive consumers, and the traditional market segmentation attributes (e.g. consumer age, salary, and background) are difficult to collect under such circumstances. This makes it impractical to apply one general CM solution to all CVS chains. Hence, it is crucial to segment a market region and then apply customised CM solutions to the corresponding segments. This paper presents an innovative market segmentation model which is driven by category-role (CR), for the first time, to support CM in CVS chains. A new similarity measure (named HCsim()) and an improved weighted fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm (WFKM) are developed in an effort to cluster the CVSs. The usefulness and applicability of this study is illustrated by means of an empirical study to provide marketing strategy decision support. The derived results are also discussed and compared with existing methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Category management; Convenience store chain management; Market segmentation; Strategic decision support","Compensation (personnel); Decision support systems; K-means clustering; Public relations; Sales; Category management; Convenience stores; Core competitiveness; Customer relationships; Fuzzy K means clustering; Market segmentation; Strategic decisions; Traditional markets; Commerce","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (70971112, 71301133, 71371159); Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, (13YJC630033)","This work is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 70971112 , 71301133 , 71371159 ) and Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education, China (Grant No. 13YJC630033 ).

Design/methodology/approach: This study combines the LRFMP model and clustering for customer segmentation. Real-life data from a grocery chain operating in Turkey is used. Three cluster validation indices are used for optimizing the number of groups of customers and K-means algorithm is employed to cluster customers. First, attributes of the LRFMP model are extracted for each customer, and then based on LRFMP model features, customers are segmented into different customer groups. Finally, identified customer segments are profiled based on LRFMP characteristics and for each customer profile, unique CRM and marketing strategies are recommended. Findings: The results show that there are five different customer groups and based on LRFMP characteristics, they are profiled as: “high-contribution loyal customers,” “low-contribution loyal customers,” “uncertain customers,” “high-spending lost customers” and “low-spending lost customers.” Practical implications: This research may provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic guideline for effectively identifying different customer profiles based on the LRFMP model, give grocery companies useful insights about different customer profiles, and assist decision makers in developing effective customer relationships and unique marketing strategies, and further allocating resources efficiently. Originality/value: This study contributes to prior literature by proposing a new RFM model, called LRFMP for the customer segmentation and providing useful insights about behaviors of different customer types in the Turkish grocery industry. It is also precious from the point of view that it is one of the first attempts in the literature which investigates the customer segmentation in the grocery retail industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","CRM;

A content analysis was used to identify the four competitor cities of Buffalo and the key attributes that the cities possess to attract tourists in the regional driving tourism market. Within the context of destination choice-sets model, the relative importance of the key attributes including city brands was investigated through a choice-based conjoint analysis. Shopping opportunities was found as the most important attribute, followed by restaurant/food, culture/festivals, sports, nature-based attractions, and city brand. Based on the relative importance of the attributes at an individual level, three distinctive tourist segments-Food and Shopping Lovers, City-Driven Do-It-All Tourists, and Cultural Tourists-were generated from a K-means cluster analysis. Different city attribute profiles were identified for those five cities. Implications and suggestions were presented to promote more efficient marketing efforts for regional tourism destinations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","choice-sets model; city brand; conjoint analysis; destination branding; Regional tourism market","","","","","","Social Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, (L10GBL001)","Chenchen Huang, PhD, is in the Department of Hospitality and Tourism at The State University of New York-Buffalo State, Caudell Hall 207, 1300 Elmwood Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14222, USA (E-mail: huangc@buffalostate.edu).
