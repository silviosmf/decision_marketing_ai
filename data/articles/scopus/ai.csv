Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial Intelligence; Decision- Making; Delphi Method; Ethics; Machine Learning; Marketing Management","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (2120481); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [ 2120481 ].

It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout. © 2022, The Author(s).","Business intelligence; CCTV visual intelligence; Retail layout; Store layout; Video analytic","Deep learning; Retail stores; Security systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; CCTV visual intelligence; Customer decisions; In-store marketing; Layout designs; Retail layout; Store layout; Sub fields; Video analytics; Visual intelligence; Sales","","","","","Queensland University of Technology, QUT; School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering, Queensland University of Technology; Business School, Queensland University of Technology; Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology, IFE; Faculty of Education, Queensland University of Technology; Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology; Centre for Materials Science, Queensland University of Technology","","Ahmed A.H., Kpalma K., Guedi A.O., Human detection using hog-svm, mixture of gaussian and background contours subtraction, 2017 13Th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), pp. 334-338, (2017); Anic I.D., Radas S., Lim L.K., Relative effects of store traffic and customer traffic flow on shopper spending, Int Rev Retail Distrib Consum Res, 20, 2, pp. 237-250, (2010); Artificial Intelligence for Retail in 2020: 12 Real-World Use Cases; Barghash M.A., Al-Qatawneh L., Ramadan S., Dababneh A., Analytical hierarchy process applied to supermarket layout selection, J Appl Res Ind Eng, 4, 4, pp. 215-226, (2017); Bill M., Dale M., Superstore interactivity: a new self-service paradigm of retail service?, Int J Retail Distrib Manag, 29, 8, pp. 379-389, (2001); Bochkovskiy A., Wang C.Y., Liao H.Y.M., Yolov4: Optimal speed and accuracy of object detection, Corr Arxiv: Abs/2004, 10934, 2020, (2020); Caetano C., Sena J., Bremond F., Dos Santos J.A., Schwartz W.R., Skelemotion: A new representation of skeleton joint sequences based on motion information for 3d action recognition, 2019 16Th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), pp. 1-8, (2019); Cai Y., Wen L., Zhang L., Du D., Wang W., Rethinking object detection in retail stores, The 35Th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2021); Cao J., Li Y., Zhang Z., Partially shared multi-task convolutional neural network with local constraint for face attribute learning, 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4290-4299, (2018); Chen Y., Tian Y., He M., Monocular human pose estimation: a survey of deep learning-based methods, Comput Vis Image Underst, 192, (2020); Chu P., Wang J., You Q., Ling H., Liu Z., Transmot: Spatial-temporal graph transformer for multiple object tracking, Corr, (2021); Cil I., Consumption universes based supermarket layout through association rule mining and multidimensional scaling, Expert Syst Appl, 39, 10, pp. 8611-8625, (2012); Cil I., Ay D., Turkan Y.S., Data driven decision support to supermarket layout, Proceedings of the 8Th WSEAS International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering and Data Bases, AIKED’09, pp. 465-470, (2009); Davenport T., Guha A., Grewal D., Bressgott T., How artificial intelligence will change the future of marketing, J Acad Mark Sci, 48, 1, pp. 24-42, (2020); Donovan R.J., Rossiter J.R., Marcoolyn G., Nesdale A., Store atmosphere and purchasing behavior, J Retail, 70, 3, pp. 283-294, (1994); Don’t Look Now: Why You Should Be Worried about Machines Reading Your Emotions, (2020); DrAsze X., Hoch S.J., Purk M.E., Shelf management and space elasticity, J Retail, 70, 4, pp. 301-326, (1994); Fernando T., Denman S., Sridharan S., Fookes C., Tracking by prediction: A deep generative model for mutli-person localisation and tracking, 2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).

One salient instance of such challenges emerges when vulnerable consumers, consumers who temporarily or permanently lack resource access or control, are unknowingly discriminated against, or excluded from the marketplace. By integrating the literature on consumer vulnerability, AI for social good, and the calls for rethinking marketing for a better world, the current work builds a framework on how to leverage AI technologies to detect, better serve, and empower vulnerable consumers. Specifically, our AID framework advocates for designing AI technologies that make services more accessible, optimize customer experiences and journeys interactively, and to dynamically improve consumer decision-making. Adopting a multi-stakeholder perspective, we also discuss the respective implications for researchers, managers, consumers, and public policy makers. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Justice; Service; Vulnerable consumers","","","","","","","","Agbavor F., Liang H., Predicting dementia from spontaneous speech using large language models, PLOS Digit Health, 1, 12, (2022); Anderson L., Ostrom A.L., Corus C., Fisk R.P., Gallan A.S., Giraldo M., Mende M., Mulder M., Rayburn S.W., Rosenbaum M.S., Shirahada K., Williams J.D., Transformative service research: An agenda for the future, Journal of Business Research, 66, 8, pp. 1203-1210, (2013); Andre Q., Carmon Z., Wertenbroch K., Crum A., Frank D., Goldstein W., Huber J., van Boven L., Weber B., Yang H., Consumer choice and autonomy in the age of artificial intelligence and big data, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, 1-2, pp. 28-37, (2018); Andrew J., Baker M., The general data protection regulation in the age of surveillance capitalism, Journal of Business Ethics, 168, 3, pp. 565-578, (2021); Argawal R., Dugas M., Gao G., Kannan P.K., Emerging technologies and analytics for a new era of value-centered marketing in healthcare, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 9-23, (2020); Auh S., Menguc B., Katsikeas C.S., Jung Y.S., When does customer participation matter?

The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation. © 2022,Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

It encompasses brand identity, organisational culture, values, and reputation, and is key in building relationships with stakeholders. An ethical corporate identity, in particular the perception of a company as ethical and socially responsible, positively influences employee behaviour and engagement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised business management and offers innovative solutions to improve decision-making, efficiency, and transparency. Integrating AI into corporate governance can improve risk management, compliance, and accountability. In the digital age, social media are key in building and maintaining the brand voice of businesses. With the advent of AI, new tools such as Chat GPT have emerged to simplify and accelerate content creation, including social media posts. However, achieving satisfactory brand-voice results using AI requires careful analysis and extensive, representative data that travels into the prompter. Although AI-generated content is fast, it should be vetted by experienced experts to ensure it aligns with brand values and brand image. Although Chat GPT promises to generate content and brand-voice, its successful use requires collaboration with experienced experts and thoughtful consideration of its use in building and maintaining an authentic and effective brand-voice. © (2024), (University of SS.

Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings: There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications: The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Errors; Fuzzy neural networks; Marketing; Product development; Accurate prediction; Business product development; Business products; Chatbots; Increasing production; Information loss; Marketing information; Neural network model; Performance; Product information; Neural network models","","","","","Guangxi 14th Five-Year Education Science Planning Project, (,2021A033, 2021ZJY1607, 2021ZJY1612, 2022ZJY1699.2022, 2022ZJY354); Guangxi Graduate Education, (JGY2022122); Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China, (21BGL129); Rural Agriculture, Culture and Tourism for Rural Revitalization, (22FGL024); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710038); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, (2020AC19034); Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents","Funding text 1: This work was sponsored by the following funds: ""Research on Multidimensional Identification and Long-term Governance Mechanism of Relative Poverty of Farming Households in Border Areas"" (Grant No. 20BGL247), General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China; Research on Branding Strategies for High-Quality Agricultural Development in Ethnic Areas of Southwest China under the ""Two Mountains"" Theory, General Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21BGL129); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation：A study on the mechanism of physician engagement behaviour in online medical communities from the perspective of network effects (No.2022M710038).

However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs)","","","","","","","","Sofla M.S., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Mirzaee R.F., Towards Effective Offloading Mechanisms in Fog Computing, Multimed.

In recent years, the rapid development and widespread application of AI have had a profound impact on enterprise management. Enterprise management is no longer limited to traditional manual decision-making and processes, but has been endowed with more efficient and intelligent methods through AI technology. The value co creation theory has completely changed the management methods of modern enterprises, transforming them from simple value carriers to active value co creators. In this situation, enterprise value chain management requires strategic enhancement, optimized design, functional management, and reputation management to adapt to these changes. The emergence of artificial intelligence as the core of the new industrial revolution further amplifies the importance of these adaptations. Under the guidance of value co creation theory, this article analyzes and explores the structure, characteristics, and transformation of enterprise value chains. Explored the management strategies of enterprise value chains, with a particular focus on the composition of consumer centered value chains. In addition, it also studied the use of artificial intelligence to deepen the enterprise management value chain, strengthen its architecture through artificial intelligence technology, and design an effective enterprise management system. Considering the changes in the business model of the entire value chain system, the transformation mechanism of artificial intelligence in the enterprise value chain was studied.

Ltd, Indore, India; Srivastava R., Department of Marketing, Management Development Institute, Gurgaon, India","Learning outcomes: After studying and analyzing this case, students will be able to: understand and evaluate the integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategy for online businesses; understand and create the various components of an IMC plan; determine the challenges of scaling up a business and how social media marketing can help in that; learn how to assemble the positioning statement of a startup; determine and differentiate the different business models (revenue models); and understand and create the social media marketing strategy. Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users. Limitations and further research suggest that marketers should investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer’s brand awareness-constructing process. © Cuong Nguyen, Thao Tran, Tien Nguyen, 2024.","brand; e-WOM; entertainment; influencer; interactivity; marketing communications; storytelling; trends","","","","","","","","Aaker D., Aaker on branding: 20 principles that drive success, (2014); Agichtein E., Castillo C., Donato D., Gionis A., Mishne G., Finding high-quality content in social media, Proceedings of the 2008 international conference on web search and data mining, pp. 183-194, (2008); Anderson E.

In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient—AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup® Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from ~20% to ~50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released ~70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use. © 2023 by the authors.","environmentally relevant; green hydra; herbicide; life cycle parameters; plant protection products","concentration (composition); European Commission; glyphosate; invertebrate; life cycle analysis; pollution exposure","","","","","Centro de Estudos Ambientais e Marinhos, Universidade de Aveiro, CESAM; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (LA/P/0094/2020)","This research was funded by CESAM financial support through national funding by Foundation for Science and Technology (UIDB/50017/2020+UIDP/50017/2020+LA/P/0094/2020).","Nivelle E., Verzeaux J., Chabot A., Roger D., Chesnais Q., Ameline A., Lacoux J., Nava-Saucedo J.E., Tetu T., Catterou M., Effects of glyphosate application and nitrogen fertilization on the soil and the consequences on aboveground and belowground interactions, Geoderma, 311, pp. 45-57, (2018); Smedbol E., Gomes M.P., Paquet S., Labrecque M., Lepage L., Lucotte M., Juneau P., Effects of low concentrations of glyphosate-based herbicide factor 540<sup>®</sup> on an agricultural stream freshwater phytoplankton community, Chemosphere, 192, pp. 133-141, (2018); Helander M., Saloniemi I., Saikkonen K., Glyphosate in northern ecosystems, Trends Plant Sci, 17, pp. 569-574, (2012); Tuffi Santos L.D., Graca R.N., Alfenas A.C., Ferreira F.A., Melo C.A., Machado M.S., Glyphosate reduces urediniospore development and Puccinia psidii disease severity on Eucalyptus grandis, Pest Manag.

In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders’ perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an “intelligent advertising” AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising. Several research questions are offered to guide future research on intelligent advertising to benefit ethical AI decision-making. Finally, several areas that can be widely applied to ethical intelligent advertising are suggested for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).","AI Algorithms; Digital marketing; Ethical considerations","","","","","","","","Abbas A., Zhou Y., Deng S., Zhang P., Text analytics to support sense-making in social media: A language-action perspective, MIS Quarterly., 42, pp. 427-464, (2018); Ajzen I., From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned Behavioral.

However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual influencers are gaining popularity on social media platforms. As a result, companies are compelled to incorporate this emerging trend into their social media campaigns. However, there is limited research available regarding the effectiveness criteria of virtual influencers to guide marketers in their selection decisions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attributes of virtual influencers that impact consumer behavioral intentions, specifically within the fashion domain. Methods:. To measure the antecedents to influencing behavioral intentions, 224 online surveys were distributed to female Instagram users selected through convenience sampling method. The empirical design of the study involoved several Instagram posts created as if by a virtual influencer promoting a fictional fashion brand. These posts measured the constructs related to the research questions, drawing from validated digital human and influencer marketing literature. The collected data was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares method. Results: The study findings revealed that content informativeness, bonding, expertise, human like attributes, and consumer innovativeness all had varying degrees of influence on behavioral intentions, with content informativeness being the most influential factor. Conclusions: The study contributes to the limited literature on virtual influencers and provides novel practical implications to marketers. It also suggests the need for further in-depth studies to identify effective attributes of virtual influencers. © 2023 DSR Publishers/ The University of Jordan.","AI influencer; CGI influencer; computer generated influencer; fashion influencer marketing; Virtual influencer","","","","","","","","Virtual Influencers Are Becoming More Real—Here’s Why Brands Should Be Cautious, (2019); Al-Emadi F.A., Ben Yahia I., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.

The marketplace, however, is in the midst of a fundamental change. Increasingly, retail is virtual, marketing is data-driven, and purchasing decisions are automated by AI. Predictive analytics are changing how consumers shop. Search costs theory no longer accurately describes the function of trademarks in this marketplace. Consumers now have numerous digital alternatives to trademarks that more efficiently provide them with increasingly accurate product information. Just as store shelves are disappearing from consumers’ retail experience, so are trademarks disappearing from their product search. Consumers may want to buy a product where the brand is the essential feature of the product such that the brand is the product, but they no longer need the assistance of a trademark to find the product. By reflexively continuing to protect trademarks in the name of search costs theory, courts give only lip service to consumer interests without questioning whether trademarks are fulfilling any useful information function. In many cases, trademarks may actually misinform consumers by masking the identity of the producer or its distanced relationship with the trademark owner. Without having deliberately decided to do so, trademark law is now protecting “brands as property” without any supportive normative rationale. Removing the veil of search costs theory will enable courts to consider whether trademark protection is justified in particular cases. © 2023, University of Washington School of Law.

Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States","Purpose: Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners’ marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers’ decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Machine learning; Prediction; Restaurant reviews; Review helpfulness","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., Online review helpfulness: role of qualitative factors, Psychology and Marketing, 33, 11, pp. 1006-1017, (2016); Ahani A., Nilashi M., Ibrahim O., Sanzogni L., Weaven S., Market segmentation and travel choice prediction in spa hotels through TripAdvisor’s online reviews, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 80, pp. 52-77, (2019); Antonio N., de Almeida A.M., Nunes L., Batista F., Ribeiro R., Hotel online reviews: creating a multi-source aggregated index, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 12, pp. 3574-3591, (2018); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Banerjee S., Bhattacharyya S., Bose I., Whose online reviews to trust?

Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801217, 71872080, 72022007); Tsinghua University, THU, (2019THZWJC12)","The authors appreciate the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments.

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Big industries started adopting AI for their HR and workforce management (WFM) activities, however, past literature suggests a lack of AI adoption in MSMEs. In the ongoing pandemic, a large number of job loss is reported in the literature. Thus, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent workforce management (WFM) may be critical during or post-pandemic to manage the huge employment in MSMEs. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual framework based on three areas where AI-powered WFM adoption for MSMEs revenue development has been highlighted. These are (a) risk management (workforce), (b) business and marketing, and (c) information exchange. Six hypotheses have been proposed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) with responses from 307 employees. According to the research findings, all of the offered hypotheses are significant. The findings suggest to MSME decision-makers that AI-powered WFM may help revenue growth, workforce risk reduction, intelligent business and marketing, and thoughtful, innovative, and safe information exchange. MSMEs are required to use AI in the information sharing that help in workforce risk management, business and marketing, and intelligent workforce management that scale-up the economic growth. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artificial intelligence;

At the same time, the use of digital marketing as a communication and sales channel has led to the need and use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to correctly manage company information. The understanding of B2B traditional Marketing strategies that use CRMs that work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been studied, however, research focused on the understanding and application of these technologies in B2B digital marketing is scarce. To cover this gap in the literature, this study develops a literature review on the main academic contributions in this area. To visualize the outcomes of the literature review, the results are then analyzed using a statistical approach known as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) under the homogeneity analysis of variance by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) framework programmed in the R language. The research results classify the types of CRMs and their typologies and explore the main techniques and uses of AI-based CRMs in B2B digital marketing. In addition, a discussion, directions and propositions for future research are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence-based CRMs; B2B digital marketing; Multiple correspondence analysis;

New levels of disruption are being introduced using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques of research. In the realm of physical and tangible aspects of service, since this sector have vast amounts of data available application of these techniques are being tested to explore various aspect of the customer experience. Data analysis algorithms like machine learning have been used by firms across the world to analyze these data and understand various facets of customer experience. However, these algorithms suffer from blackbox issues where businesses do not know how the outcome was achieved and if the analysis is biased in some way. In this study, we utilize an explainable machine learning approach on Airbnb data to understand solve two challenges associated with large-scale marketing data. First, we identify and prioritize the customer experience factors like bedrooms, host status, host response rate etc. that have an impact on product pricing. Secondly, we build and test an explainable predictive model on the same. Our research has significant implications for academia and industry in identifying applications of explainable algorithms in decision-making. © 2021 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Customer experience; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Tourism","","","","","","","","Azam N., Yao J., Comparison of term frequency and document frequency based feature selection metrics in text categorization, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 5, pp. 4760-4768, (2012); Babin B.J., Darden W.R., Griffin M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 4, pp. 644-656, (1994); Batista G.E.A.P.A., Monard M.C., An analysis of four missing data treatment methods for supervised learning, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 17, 5-6, pp. 519-533, (2003); Bolton R.N., McColl-Kennedy J.R., Cheung L., Gallan A., Orsingher C., Witell L., Et al., Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, Journal of Service Management, 20, pp. 644-656, (2018); Bose I., Mahapatra R.K., Business data mining—A machine learning perspective, Information & Management, 39, 3, pp. 211-225, (2001); Bueno E.V., Weber T.B.B., Bomfim E.L., Kato H.T., Measuring customer experience in service: A systematic review, The Service Industries Journal, 39, 11-12, pp. 779-798, (2019); Bullock L., (2021); Cambra-Fierro J., Gao L.X., Melero-Polo I., Sese F.J., What drives consumers’ active participation in the online channel?

However, actionable guidelines to promote a holistic adaptation and the effective functioning of destination marketing/management organizations (DMOs) in the increasingly data-infused world are still needed. This perspective paper posits a research-based framework that DMOs can use to become more responsive and efficient in their marketing and planning efforts in the current AI-infused world. Four propositions are presented to support DMOs’ transition to the insight-era: (a) DMOs’ organizational adaptations and workforce development and training, (b) active engagement with destinations’ stakeholders and data sharing, (c) leverage user-generated data and emergent technologies for destination marketing, and (d) DMOs’ data-driven decision making. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data; data-driven decision-making; data-driven eco-systems; destination marketing organizations; insight Era; the Internet of Things","","","","","","Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, TIP, (1937833)","","Castells M., The Information Age, Media Stud.

The information is used to create the model and improve the quality of products and services to satisfy customers. There are two major parts to a sale's planning: containing sales tactics and sales strategy. To aid in business decision-making, a data warehouse (DW) for sales collects and organizes relevant and historical data. DW is also a method for combining data from various heterogeneous databases (DB) and other sources of information for analysis. In this paper, Information analysis for dynamic Sale planning by AI Decision support process was done. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithms have been used to find optimal MVs for sale planning since several authors prove that these algorithms are better than other existing algorithms. MVs selection is based on three factors: time running of MVs, area of MVs, and access frequency of MVs by manipulating the selection result using a weighted combination of each factor as needed by the designer. For PSO, the most cost of frequency was 1.924 for View (V) 11, while for QPSO, it was 1.722 for V11. For PSO, the most cost of time was 1.931 for V2, while for QPSO, it was 1.221 for V22. For PSO, the most cost of the area was 1.800 for V17, while for QPSO, it was 1.071 for V17. The results revealed that Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization is much more accurate than Particle Swarm Optimization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence AI; Database management system; Decision support process;

However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency. © 2024 The Authors","Aeronautics; Artificial Intelligence; Benefits; Performance; Use cases","Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Predictive analytics; Air France; Artificial intelligence technologies; Benefit; Conceptual maps; Dassault Aviation; Easyjet; Performance; Scientific literature; Sequential approach; Use case; Efficiency","","","","","","","Ahmed R., Shaheen S., Philbin S.P., The role of big data analytics and decision-making in achieving project success, J.

Despite its widespread acceptance, among patients and practitioners, there are concerns that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence may threaten elements of patient-centered care, such as personal relationships with care providers and patient-driven choices. This study explores the extent to which patients are confident in and comfortable with the use of these technologies when it comes to their own individual care and identifies areas that may align with or threaten elements of patient-centered care. Methods: An exploratory, mixed-method approach was used to analyze survey data from 600 US-based adults in the State of Florida. The survey was administered through a leading market research provider (August 10–21, 2023), and responses were collected to be representative of the state’s population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Results: Respondents were more comfortable with the use of AI in health-related tasks that were not associated with doctor-patient relationships, such as scheduling patient appointments or follow-ups (84.2%). Fear of losing the ‘human touch’ associated with doctors was a common theme within qualitative coding, suggesting a potential conflict between the implementation of AI and patient-centered care. In addition, decision self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of comfort with AI, but there were also concerns about losing decision-making control, workforce changes, and cost concerns. A small majority of participants mentioned that AI could be useful for doctors and lead to more equitable care but only when used within limits. Conclusion: The application of AI in medical care is rapidly advancing, but oversight, regulation, and guidance addressing critical aspects of patient-centered care are lacking. While there is no evidence that AI will undermine patient-physician relationships at this time, there is concern on the part of patients regarding the application of AI within medical care and specifically as it relates to their interaction with physicians. Medical guidance on incorporating AI while adhering to the principles of patient-centered care is needed to clarify how AI will augment medical care. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Patient-centered care; Patient-physician relationship; Public perception","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Florida; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient-Centered Care; Physician-Patient Relations; Public Opinion; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; article; artificial intelligence; doctor patient relationship; ethnicity; fear; follow up; human; marketing; medical care; perception; person centered care; physician; self concept; United States; adolescent; aged; ethics; female; Florida; health care delivery; male; middle aged; public opinion; questionnaire; young adult","","","","","Florida Center for Cybersecurity","The survey was funded by the Florida Center for Cybersecurity.

While AI climate refers to the shared perceptions of policies, procedures, and practices to support AI initiatives, cognitive service analytics capability refers to the analytical insights driven by AI climate and augmented by both machines and humans to make marketing decisions. However, there is limited knowledge on the antecedents of such analytics capabilities and their overall effects on service innovation and market performance. Drawing on service analytics literature and the microfoundations of dynamic capability theory, this study fills this research gap using in-depth interviews (n = 30) and a survey (n = 276) of service analytics managers within the AI climate in Australia. The findings confirm the five microfoundations of cognitive service analytics capabilities (cognitive technology, cognitive information, cognitive problem solving, cognitive knowledge & skills, cognitive training & development). The findings also highlight the significant mediating effect of service innovation in the relationship between analytics climate and market performance and cognitive service analytics capability and market performance. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","AI climate; B2B markets; Cognitive service analytics capability; Market performance; Service innovation","","","","","","","","Aguinis H., Kraiger K., Benefits of training and development for individuals and teams, organizations, and society, Annual Review of Psychology, 60, 1, pp. 451-474, (2009); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, International Journal of Production Economics, 182, pp. 113-131, (2016); Akter S., Fosso Wamba S., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

Case overview/synopsis: In November 2022, Tata Group, the salt to software conglomerate, announced the merger of Air India (AI) and Vistara. This would lead to the formation of the full-service airline under the brand name “Air India”. The obvious reason behind this was the higher recognition, salience and recall of the brand AI as compared with Vistara in the global market. The Tata Group envisaged the brand AI to be a significant international aviation player with the heritage, persona and ethos of the brand Vistara in the renewed manifestation of AI. To realise these goals, Tata Group laid down an ambitious plan called “Vihaan.AI”, which was aimed at capturing a domestic market share of 30% by 2027.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding its application in various business disciplines and is expected to be one of the most important technological tools used in marketing in the years to come. The paper addresses the expected role of artificial intelligence solutions in marketing decision-making throughout the five steps of the marketing process. The study provides a systematic review of the research articles addressing the application of AI for marketing decision-making published in the period from 2020 to 2022. Identified applications are then mapped to five steps of the marketing process: analysis, strategy, tactics, customer relations, and value proposition creation. The findings indicate that most of the current AI applications are utilized in the first stage of the marketing process related to understanding and predicting customer behaviour and in the tactical stage of creating a marketing mix. The paper concludes with recommendations for marketing practitioners and recommendations for further research. © 2022 Nikolina Ljepava; published by UIKTEN.","Ai marketing; Decision-making; Machine learning; Marketing process","","","","","","","","Al-Ghamdi L.

Kennedy 6, Parma, 43125, Italy","Understanding how to increase satisfaction and loyalty is of interest to retailers since it has been demonstrated that loyal customers are more profitable than non-loyal ones. The extant literature demonstrated that marketing mix components can affect the satisfaction and loyalty to the retailer. These levers can be divided into two groups: micro (price differentiation, fidelity cards) and macro (price, assortment, private label, services) levers. Among macro ones, price seems to be the most important variable able to influence the selection of a retailer, the level of satisfaction and loyalty. However, customers are not able to judge the real value for money, so it is very important to analyze the perceived price image and to identify the variables on which it depends on. Previous studies have demonstrated that our perceptions, judgments and even preferences are influenced by the way decision problems are framed, so how pricing strategies are communicated is a critical element. This is true, not only for companies that face with final customers but also for wholesalers and, specifically, for Cash and Carry wholesalers, which face with final customers, restaurants and retailers. But, if on one hand, price communication has been deeply investigated in the retailing sector, the same cannot be said for what concerns wholesalers and, in particular, Cash and Carry format. For these reasons, the present work aims to analyze the impact of different ways of price communication can affect customers’ satisfaction and loyalty in the Cash and Carry format, through focus groups methodology, given the novelty of the topic. Findings could help wholesalers to more optimally communicate price promotions in order to better meet the needs of different types of customers and increase the level of satisfaction. © 2019 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

In particular, ML-based chatbot systems have been developed to simulate chats with people using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Galaz V., Centeno M.

AI autonomy, however, sparks skepticism among consumers leading to a decrease in their willingness to adopt AI services. This raises the question as to whether consumer trust in companies can overcome consumer reluctance in their decisions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services. Design/methodology/approach: Using a representative survey (N = 503 consumers corresponding to N = 3,690 observations), this article investigated the link between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services from the company across 23 consumer service companies accounting for six distinct service industries. Findings: The results confirm a significant and positive relationship between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt AI services from the same company. AI autonomy, however, moderates this relationship, such that high (vs low) AI autonomy weakens the positive link between trust in a company and AI service adoption. This finding replicates across all 23 companies and the associated six industries and is robust to the inclusion of several theoretically important control variables. Originality/value: The current research contributes to the recent stream of AI research by drawing attention to the interplay between trust in companies and adoption of high autonomy AI services, with implications for the successful deployment and marketing of AI services. © 2023, Darius-Aurel Frank, Lina Fogt Jacobsen, Helle Alsted Søndergaard and Tobias Otterbring.","Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Innovation adoption; Trust in the company","","","","","","Carlsbergfondet, (CF21_0225)","This research received support from the Carlsberg Foundation through a research infrastructure grant (No. CF21_0225).","Aaker D.A., Keller K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 27-41, (1990); Andre Q., Carmon Z., Wertenbroch K., Crum A., Frank D., Goldstein W., Huber J., Van Boven L., Weber B., Yang H., Consumer choice and autonomy in the age of artificial intelligence and big data, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, pp. 28-37, (2018); Aurier P., N'Goala G., The differing and mediating roles of trust and relationship commitment in service relationship maintenance and development, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 3, pp. 303-325, (2010); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Funder D.C., Psychology as the science of self-reports and finger movements: whatever happened to actual behavior?, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2, 4, pp. 396-403, (2007); Becerra E.P., Korgaonkar P.K., Effects of trust beliefs on consumers' online intentions, European Journal of Marketing, 45, 6, pp. 936-962, (2011); Beer J.M., Fisk A.D., Rogers W.A., Toward a framework for levels of robot autonomy in human-robot interaction, Journal of Human-Robot Interaction, 3, 2, (2014); Bergkvist L., Rossiter J.R., The predictive validity of multiple-item versus single-item measures of the same constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 2, pp. 175-184, (2007); Bilgihan A., Gen Y customer loyalty in online shopping: an integrated model of trust, user experience and branding, Computers in Human Behavior, 61, pp. 103-113, (2016); Bottomley P.A., Holden S.J.S., Do we really know how consumers evaluate brand extensions?

In addition to automating and optimizing existing processes, AI opens up new opportunities for purchasers to undertake new, strategic, collaborative, enduring missions. AI enables complex, strategic decision-making in an unpredictable, hostile environment. This article analyzes to what extent AI can improve the performance of the purchasing department. First, a review is undertaken of how AI is used in purchasing. Thereafter, the research follows an exploratory, inductive, and qualitative approach based on a multiple case study of the following technologies: (1) the Synertrade automated international purchasing system; (2) the Silex matching system; (3) SAP Ariba decision support; (4) Jaggaer supplier relations management; and (5) the Ideapoke collaborative ideation and innovative project management platform. The present study's contributions lie in its redefinition of the purchasing function, of the purchaser's role, of supplier relationship management policy, and of interdepartmental collaboration, involving, for example, Marketing and R&D. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Collaborative project management; Decision-making; Machine learning; Matching systems; Purchasing function","","","","","","","","Allal-Cherif O., Maira S., Collaboration as an anti-crisis solution: The role of the procurement function, International Journal of Physical Distribution & logistics Management, 41, 9, pp. 860-877, (2011); Allal-Cherif O., Makhlouf M., Using serious games to manage knowledge: The SECI model perspective, Journal of Business Research, 69, 5, pp. 1539-1543, (2016); Aragon-Mendoza J., Pardo del Val M., Roig-Dobon S., The influence of institutions development in venture creation decision: A cognitive view, Journal of Business Research, 69, 11, pp. 4941-4946, (2016); Asthana N., Gupta M., Supplier selection using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm, International Journal of Indian Culture and Business Management, 11, 4, pp. 457-472, (2015); Baryannis G., Validi S., Dani S., Antoniou G., Supply chain risk management and artificial intelligence: State of the art and future research directions, International Journal of Production Research, 57, 7, pp. 2179-2202, (2019); Batran A., Erben A., Schulz R., Sperl F., Procurement 4.0: A survival guide in a digital, disruptive world, (2017); Bienhaus F., Haddud A., Procurement 4.0: Factors influencing the digitization of procurement and supply chains, Business Process Management Journal, 24, 4, pp. 965-984, (2018); Bleda M., Chicot J., The role of public procurement in the formation of markets for innovation, Journal of Business Research, 107, pp. 186-196, (2020); Borges M., Hoppen N., Luce F.B., Information technology impact on market orientation in e-business, Journal of Business Research, 62, 9, pp. 883-890, (2009); Buyukozkan G., An integrated fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making approach for green supplier evaluation, International Journal of Production Research, 50, 11, pp. 2892-2909, (2012); Choi T.Y., Krause D.R., The supply base and its complexity: Implications for transaction costs, risks, responsiveness, and innovation, Journal of Operations Management, 24, 5, pp. 637-652, (2006); Chung M., Ko E., Joung H., Kim S.J., Chatbot e-service and customer satisfaction regarding luxury brands, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 587-595, (2020); Dauvergne P., Is artificial intelligence greening global supply chains?

AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions. Our work contributes to theory and practice with a set of actionable design principles to guide AIADM system design and deployment. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, though many firms want to take advantage of AI to improve marketing, they lack a process by which to execute a Marketing AI project. This article discusses the use of AI to provide support for marketing decisions. Based on the established Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, it creates a process for managers to use when executing a Marketing AI project and discusses issues that might arise. It explores how this framework was used to develop three cutting-edge Marketing AI applications. © The Regents of the University of California 2019.","Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Marketing; Social media; Social networks","","","","","","Laboratory for Analytic Sciences","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work supported in whole or in part with funding from the Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS).","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","00081256","","","","English","Calif.

Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a category of services that offers considerable potential for organisations to extract valuable insights from their data while reducing the requirement for heavy technical expertise. This article explores the use of MLaaS within the realm of marketing applications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of MLaaS implementations and their benefits within the domain of marketing. Furthermore, we present a platform that possesses the capability to be customised and expanded to address marketing’s unique requirements. Three modules are introduced: Churn Prediction, One-2-One Product Recommendation, and Send Frequency Prediction. When applied to marketing, the proposed MLaaS system exhibits considerable promise for use in applications such as automated detection of client churn prior to its occurrence, individualised product recommendations, and send time optimisation. Our study revealed that AI-driven campaigns can improve both the Open Rate and Click Rate. This approach has the potential to enhance customer engagement and retention for businesses while enabling well-informed decisions by leveraging insights derived from consumer data. This work contributes to the existing body of research on MLaaS in marketing and offers practical insights for businesses seeking to utilise this approach to enhance their competitive edge in the contemporary data-oriented marketplace. © 2024 by the authors.","churn prediction; machine learning; marketing; MLaaS; product recommendation; send frequency; service","","","","","","Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC; COMPETE 2020; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This article is a result of the project \u201CCria\u00E7\u00E3o de um N\u00FAcleo de I&D para a gera\u00E7\u00E3o de novo conhecimento nas \u00E1reas de Intelig\u00EAncia Artificial, Machine Learning, Intelligent Marketing e One-2-One Marketing\u201D, handled by the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation (COMPETE 2020) through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement.","Volume of Data/Information Created, Captured, Copied, and Consumed Worldwide from 2010 to 2020, with Forecasts from 2021 to 2025, (2021); Huang M.H., Rust R.T., A strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing, J.

Using the Grounded Theory (GT) research method and a consumer value perspective, we examine the enrolment decision-making of international students in the presence of AIVAs to propose a conceptual model linking value to adoption. Findings highlight the influence of the key antecedents of hedonic and functional value in AIVA adoption. The findings also indicate that the student and the AIVA can co-create novel experiences during information search and evaluation of enrollment alternatives. Some participants proactively suggest a larger role for the AIVA to aid their enrollment decision-making. Points of attention for university marketing managers are suggested based on the proposed core concept and the resulting tentative hypotheses. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AI-enabled voice assistants; consumer behaviour; enrollment decision-making; international marketing of higher education; international students; university marketing strategy","","","","","","","","Al-Kaisi A.N., Arkhangelskaya A.L., Rudenko-Morgun O.I., The didactic potential of the voice assistant “Alice” for students of a foreign language at a university, Education and Information Technologies, 26, 1, pp. 715-732, (2021); Al Shamsi J.H., Al-Emran M., Shaalan K., Understanding key drivers affecting students’ use of artificial intelligence-based voice assistants, Education and Information Technologies, pp. 1-21, (2022); Ashfaq M., Yun J., Yu S., Loureiro S.M.C., I, Chatbot: Modeling the determinants of users’ satisfaction and continuance intention of AI-powered service agents, Telematics and Informatics, 54, (2020); Balakrishnan J., Dwivedi Y.K., Role of cognitive absorption in building user trust and experience, Psychology & Marketing, 38, 4, pp. 643-668, (2021); Bamberger A., Bronshtein Y., Yemini M., Marketing universities and targeting international students: A comparative analysis of social media data trails, Teaching in Higher Education, 25, 4, pp. 476-492, (2020); Brill T.M., Munoz L., Miller R.J., Siri, Alexa, and other digital assistants: a study of customer satisfaction with artificial intelligence applications, Journal of Marketing Management, 35, 15-16, pp. 1401-1436, (2019); Brown J., Oplatka I., Universities in a competitive global marketplace: A systematic review of the literature on higher education marketing, International Journal of Public Sector Management, 19, 4, pp. 316-338, (2006); Cao D., Sun Y., Goh E., Wang R., Kuiavska K., Adoption of smart voice assistants technology among Airbnb guests: A revised self-efficacy-based value adoption model (SVAM), International Journal of Hospitality Management, 101, (2022); (2019); Chapleo C., O'Sullivan H., Contemporary thought in higher education marketing, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 27, 2, pp. 159-161, (2017); Chen C.H., Zimitat C., Understanding Taiwanese students’ decision-making factors regarding Australian international higher education, International Journal of Educational Management, 20, 2, pp. 91-100, (2006); Corbin J., Strauss A., Basics of qualitative research: Techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory, (2008); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Dellaert B.G., Shu S.B., Arentze T.A., Baker T., Diehl K., Donkers B., Fast N.J., Haubl G., Johnson H., Karmarkar U.R., Oppewal H., Schmitt B.H., Schroeder J., Spiller S.A., Steffel M., Consumer decisions with artificially intelligent voice assistants, Marketing Letters, 31, 4, pp. 335-347, (2020); de Wit H., Altbach P.G., Internationalization in higher education: global trends and recommendations for its future, Policy Reviews in Higher Education, 5, 1, pp. 28-46, (2021); Fernandes T., Oliveira E., Understanding consumers’ acceptance of automated technologies in service encounters: Drivers of digital voice assistants adoption, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 180-191, (2021); Fleischman D., Raciti M., Lawley M., Degrees of co-creation: An exploratory study of perceptions of international students’ role in community engagement experiences, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 25, 1, pp. 85-103, (2015); Flint D.J., Woodruff R.B., Gardial S.F., Customer value change in industrial marketing relationships: a call for new strategies and research, Industrial Marketing Management, 26, 2, pp. 163-175, (1997); Foehr J., Germelmann C.C., Alexa, can I trust you?

The paper aims to look into the transformation of the new middle-class into the NMC in emerging economies and its potential to the companies and investors. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws insight from 558 new middle-class consumers in Delhi-NCR. ANOVA, post hoc tests, and hierarchical multiple linear regression model are applied to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The NMC living in India's megacities imitates the lifestyle of their counterparts living in the West. To maintain their status and present themselves different from those living in middle or lower-middle-class categories, they spend audaciously, even though the income is low. When they enter the new middle class, their consumption, saving and lifestyle diversify positively. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations. First, the authors do not apply any behavioral theory or marketing model such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA), Engel-kollat-Blackwell (EKB) model or theory of normative model of target markets. Second, the research is limited to the NMC of only one emerging economy, i.e., India. Third, the research sample is limited to only one megacity of India, i.e., Delhi. Finally, this research used only one factor, i.e., AI, to study the consumption pattern. Practical implications: The results suggest that considering the buying habits and lifestyle of Indian the NMC, consumers would prove helpful to the companies in product decision-making. Furthermore, understanding change in investment habits across different income levels would be advantageous to financial institutions, investment planners and marketers while designing their products to attract investment. Originality/value: The research holds significance from the point of view of understanding Indian consumers encompassing the the NMC and predicting their implications on consumer goods-producing industries, which shall, in turn, facilitate producers and government in formulating policies and strategies. © 2021, Asiya Chaudhary and Sabiha Khatoon.","Annual income (AI); Buying/ spending habits (B/SH); Consumer behavior (CB); Investment habits (IH); Lifestyle (LS); Middle class (MC); New middle class (NMC)","","","","","","Indian Council of Social Science Research, ICSSR; Ministry of Education, India, MoE, (02/191/2016-17/ RP)","The work was supported by the ICSSR.

The model explains how people make ethical decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI), involving machine learning, is replacing humans and making decisions based on algorithms or rules developed by programmers. The challenge is how to program the ethical component of AI decisions normally provided by humans. H-V is a descriptive model that can be applied to making AI ethical decisions.

Central to this approach is an iterative model that adapts teaching strategies to keep pace with technological advancements and industry demands. The framework emphasizes practical application, steering curriculum development towards the inclusion of AI tools like machine learning and predictive analytics, and crafting experiential learning opportunities. A focused examination of current teaching methods reveals gaps and introduces actionable solutions for fostering analytical skills essential for the AI-enhanced marketing landscape. The model not only advocates for a balance between theory and practice but also addresses challenges such as resource accessibility and the necessity of ethical considerations in AI education. By promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and continual curriculum refreshment, the paper positions the model as an essential blueprint for nurturing future marketing professionals capable of leveraging AI analytics for strategic decision-making. The conclusion calls for academia-industry partnerships to further enrich marketing education and underscores the importance of this framework in preparing students for successful careers in AI-driven marketing. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","AI-driven marketing analytics;

The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, is challenging interaction between humans and machines changing the service systems’ value co-creation configurations and logic. To envision possible future scenarios, this paper aims to reflect upon how the humans’ use of AI technology can impact value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is developed, at a conceptual level, using selected elements from managerial and marketing theoretical frameworks interested in value co-creation – Service-Dominant Logic, Service Science and Viable Systems Approach (VSA) – used as interpretative tools to reframe value co-creation in the digital age. Findings: The interpretative approach adopted and, in particular, the new VSA notion of Intelligence Augmentation (IA), in the perspective of the information variety model, shed new light on value co-creation in the digital age framing a possible “IA effect” that can empower value co-creation in complex decision-making contexts. Practical implications: The study provides insights useful in the design and management of service systems suggesting a rethinking of the view of AI as a means for mainly increasing the smartness of service systems and a new focus on the enhancement of the human resources contribution to make the service systems wiser. Originality/value: The paper provides a refocused interpretative view of the interaction between humans and AI that looks at a possible positive impact of the use of AI on humans in terms of augmented decision-making capabilities in conditions of complexity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Intelligence augmentation; Smart service systems; Value co-creation; Wise service systems","","","","","","","","Ackoff R., From data to wisdom, Journal of Applied Systems Analysis, 16, pp. 3-9, (1989); Akaka M.A., Chandler J.D., Roles as rosources: a social roles perspective of change in value networks, Marketing Theory, 11, 3, pp. 243-260, (2010); Akaka M.A., Vargo S.L., Technology as an operant resource in service (eco) systems, Information Systems and e-Business Management, 12, 3, pp. 367-384, (2014); Arthur W.B., The Nature of Technology: What It is and How It Evolves, (2009); Arthur W.B., Where is technology taking the economy?, (2017); Barile S., Management Sistemico Vitale, (2009); Barile S., Polese F., Smart service systems and viable service systems: applying systems theory to service science, Service Science, 2, 1-2, pp. 21-40, (2010); Barile S., Saviano M., An introduction to a value co-creation model, viability, syntropy and resonance in dyadic interaction, Syntropy, 2, 2, pp. 69-89, (2013); Barile S., Saviano M., Complexity and sustainability in management: insights from a systems perspective, Social Dynamics in a Systems Perspective, pp. 39-63, (2018); Barile S., Di Nauta P., Iandolo F., La Decostruzione Della Complessità, Studi MOA, Collana Studi di Management e Organizzazione Aziendale, (2016); Barile S., Saviano M., Polese F., Information asymmetry and co-creation in health care services, Australasian Marketing Journal (Journal), 22, 3, pp. 205-217, (2014); Barile S., Espejo R., Perko I., Saviano M., Cybernetics and Systems: Social and Business Decisions, (2018); Barile S., Orecchini F., Saviano M., Farioli F., People, technology, and governance for sustainability: the contribution of systems and cyber-systemic thinking, Sustainability Science, 13, 5, pp. 1197-1208, (2018); Barile S., Pels J., Polese F., Saviano M., An introduction to the viable systems approach and its contribution to marketing, Journal of Business Market Management, 5, 2, pp. 54-78, (2012); Barile S., Bassano C., Lettieri M., Piciocchi P., Saviano M., Intelligence augmentation (IA) in complex decision making: a new view of the VSA concept of relevance, AHFE 2020, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC), 1208, pp. 1-8, (2020); Barile S., Lusch R., Reynoso J., Saviano M., Spohrer J., Systems, networks, and ecosystems in service research, Journal of Service Management, (2016); Barile S., Piciocchi P., Bassano C., Spohrer J.C., Pietronudo M.C., Re-defining the role of artificial intelligence in wiser service systems, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC), 787, pp. 159-170, (2019); Barile S., Polese F., Saviano M., Carrubbo L., Clarizia F., Service research contribution to healthcare networks’ understanding, Innovative Service Perspectives, 1, (2012); Barile S., Bassano C., Spohrer J.C., Piciocchi P., Pietronudo M.C., Saviano M., AI & value co-creation: an integrated VSA and SS perspective, paper presented at the AIRSI 2019 Conference, (2019); Barile S., Ferretti M., Bassano C., Piciocchi P., Spohrer J., Pietronudo M.C., From smart to wise systems: shifting from artificial intelligence (AI) to intelligence augmentation (IA), poster presented at the First in International Workshop on Opentech AI in Helsinki, (2018); Bassano C., Piciocchi P., Spohrer J.C., Pietronudo M.C., Managing value co-creation in consumer service systems within smart retail settings, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 45, pp. 190-197, (2018); Bassano C., Barile S., Saviano M., Cosimato S., Pietronudo M.C., AI technologies & value co-creation in a luxury context, Paper presented at the 53th HI International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS), (2020); Beer S., Brain of the Firm: The Managerial Cybernetics of Organization, (1972); Breidbach C., Maglio P., Technology-enabled value co-creation: an empirical analysis of actors, resources, and practices, Industrial Marketing Management, 56, (2016); Brynjolfsson E., Mcafee A., The business of artificial intelligence, Harvard Business Review, 1, (2017); Campbell M., Hoane A.J., Hsu F.H., Deep blue, Artificial Intelligence, 134, 1-2, pp. 57-83, (2002); Carayannis E.G., Del Giudice M., Saviano M., Caputo F., Beyond big data.

In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance. In addition, HMDM and AAI are also proposed for firms to optimise FCMP. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Competitive marketing performance; Holistic marketing decision; Marketing analytics capability","","","","","","North South University","The authors acknowledge North South University (NSU) for awarding research grant to conduct this research.","Aderemi H.O., Oyebisi T.O., Management and evaluation of technological capability in ICT firms: an information system approach, International Journal of Business Information Systems, 11, 2, pp. 127-147, (2012);

The research adds to AI and text analysis approaches by considering the whole meaning of a post rather than an analysis of subsets of information in text and other media. The use of MSLA is validated across the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The findings show that MSLA helps (i) reveal structures in what appear to be unstructured multimodal posts; (ii) identify all the sentiment items in a post; (iii) identify implicit meanings, such as irony, humour and sarcasm; and (iv) further identify emotions and judgements in multimodal communication. Importantly, this paper explains how decisions and opinions are made online and how marketing strategies can be tailored towards meanings derived from multimodal communication in social media. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer sentiment; inter-coder reliability; Multimodal social listening; qualitative research; social media; social networking","","","","","","","","Abburi H., Prasath R., Shrivastava M., Gangashetty S.V., Multimodal sentiment analysis using deep neural networks, Vol. 10089 LNAI. 4th International Conference on Mining Intelligence and Knowledge Exploration, MIKE 2016, pp. 58-65, (2017); Abousnnouga G., Machin D., The changing spaces of war commemoration: A multimodal analysis of the discourses of British monuments, Social Semiotics, 21, 2, pp. 175-196, (2011); Adjei M., Noble S., Noble C., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Amalia E.M., Giana M.E., Just friends, good acquaintances or soul mates? an exploration of web site connectedness, Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 10, 3, pp. 227-242, (2007); Amorim G., Franco R., Moraes R., Figueiredo B., Miranda J., Dobroes J., Afonso R., Meiguins B., SocialMood: An information visualization tool to measure the mood of the people in social networks, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, (2014); Anido F.N., When luxury advertising adds the identitary values of luxury: A semiotic analysis, Journal of Business Research, 67, 12, pp. 2666-2675, (2014); Areni C., Ontological security as an unconscious motive of social media users, Journal of Marketing Management, 35, 1-2, pp. 75-96, (2019); Baecchi C., Uricchio T., Bertini M., Del Bimbo A., A multimodal feature learning approach for sentiment analysis of social network multimedia, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 75, 5, pp. 2507-2525, (2016); Bail C.A., Combining natural language processing and network analysis to examine how advocacy organizations stimulate conversation on social media, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113, 42, pp. 11823-11828, (2016); Bezemer J., Kress G., Multimodality, learning and communication: A social semiotic frame, (2016); Borras-Morell J.E., Data mining for pulsing the emotion on the web, Methods in molecular biology, pp. 123-130, (2015); Brennan J., The Todd Carney “bubbling” social media scandal, Popular Communication, 14, 4, pp. 199-211, (2016); Broth M., Mondada L., Walking away: The embodied achievement of activity closings in mobile interaction, Journal of Pragmatics, 47, 1, pp. 41-58, (2013); Cambria E., Poria S., Gelbukh A., Thelwall M., Sentiment analysis is a big suitcase, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 32, 6, pp. 74-80, (2017); Campbell J.L., Quincy C., Osserman J., Pedersen O.K., Coding in-depth semistructured interviews: Problems of unitization and intercoder reliability and agreement, Sociological Methods & Research, 42, 3, pp. 294-320, (2013); Canhoto A.I., Padmanabhan Y., ‘We (don’t) know how you feel’–a comparative study of automated vs. manual analysis of social media conversations, Journal of Marketing Management, 31, 9-10, pp. 1141-1157, (2015); Capriello A., Mason P.R., Davis B., Crotts J.C., Farm tourism experiences in travel reviews: A cross-comparison of three alternative methods for data analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 6, pp. 778-785, (2013); Chervachidze S., Costello J., Wheaton W., The secular and cyclic determinants of capitalization rates: The role of property fundamentals, macroeconomic factors, and “structural changes”, Journal of Portfolio Management, 35, 5, pp. 50-69, (2009); Christodoulides G., Jevons C., Bonhomme J., Memo to marketers: Quantitative evidence for change: How user-generated content really affects brands, Journal of Advertising Research, 52, 1, pp. 53-64, (2012); Chung T.-L.-D., Anaza N.A., Park J., Hall-Phillips A., Who’s behind the screen?

Traditionally, people use Google and other search platforms to research a product before purchasing. However, with the integration of ChatGPT into Bing and Google’s announcement of BARD, these models have the potential to impact how customers search for and discover products significantly. This article aims to understand whether people will shift from traditional to Generative AI-based search engines. The research examines the factors influencing purchase decisions and the likelihood of individuals using ChatGPT instead of traditional search engines and other sources. The results indicate that gender, product knowledge, and preference for online or retail store purchases can help predict their inclination to switch to ChatGPT. The paper also discusses people’s trust in Generative AI and the influence of demographic features on their attitude toward these machine learning systems. © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","Digital marketing; generative AI; product research","Learning systems; Retail stores; Sales; Demographic features; Digital marketing; Generative AI; Google+; Machine learning systems; Product information; Product knowledge; Product research; Purchase decision; Search engines","","","","","","","Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Improving language understanding by generative pre-training, (2018); Wang F.Y., Miao Q., Li X., Wang X., Lin Y., What does ChatGPT say: the DAO from algorithmic intelligence to linguistic intelligence, IEEE/CAA J Autom Sinica, 10, 3, pp. 575-579, (2023); Zarifhonarvar A., Economics of ChatGPT: a labor market view on the occupational impact of artificial intelligence; Kurian N., Cherian J.M., Sudharson N.A., Varghese K.G., Wadhwa S., AI is now everywhere, Br Dent J, 234, 2, (2023); Weizenbaum J., ELIZA a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine, Comput Linguist, 9, 1, pp. 36-45, (1966); Lenat D., Prakash M., Shepherd M., CYC: using common sense knowledge to overcome brittleness and knowledge acquisition bottlenecks, AI Mag, 6, 4, (1985); Shadbolt N., Hall W., Berners-Lee T., The semantic web revisited, IEEE Intell Syst, 21, 3, pp. 96-101, (2006); Ferrucci D., Levas A., Bagchi S., Gondek D., Mueller E.T., Watson: beyond jeopardy!, Artif Intell, 199, 200, pp. 93-105, (2013); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, (2017); Paulheim H., Knowledge graph refinement: a survey of approaches and evaluation methods, Semantic Web, 8, pp. 489-508, (2017); Chen L., Jiang M., Jia F., Liu G., Artificial intelligence adoption in business-to-business marketing: toward a conceptual framework, J Bus Ind Mark, 37, 5, pp. 1025-1044, (2022); Stone M., Aravopoulou E., Ekinci Y., Evans G., Hobbs M., Labib A., Laughlin P., Machtynger J., Machtynger L., Artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic marketing decision-making: a research agenda, Bottom Line, 33, 2, pp. 183-200, (2020); Frieder S., Pinchetti L., Griffiths R.R., Salvatori T., Lukasiewicz T., Petersen P.C., Chevalier A., Berner J., Mathematical capabilities of ChatGPT, (2023); Geerling W., Dirk Mateer G., Wooten J., Damodaran N., ChatGPT has mastered the principles of economics: now what?, SSRN Electron J; Sun C., Shi Z., Liu X., Ghose A., Li X., Xiong F., The effect of voice AI on consumer purchase and search behavior, (2021); GiachosI I., Papakitsos E.C., Savvidis P., Laskaris N., Inquiring natural language processing capabilities on robotic systems through virtual assistants: a systemic approach, J Comput Sci Res, 5, 2, pp. 28-36, (2023); Sakirin T., Ben Said R., User preferences for ChatGPT-powered conversational interfaces versus traditional methods, Meso J Comput Sci, pp. 24-31, (2023); Priya B., Sharma V., Exploring users’ adoption intentions of intelligent virtual assistants in financial services: an anthropomorphic perspectives and socio-psychological perspectives, Comput Hum Behav, 148, (2023); Ruggeri K., Kacha O., Menezes I.G., Kos M., Franklin M., Parma L., Langdon P., Matthews B., Miles J., In with the new?

While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2).

This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance).

The purpose of this article is to show what artificial intelligence (AI) tools - expert systems - can actually be used for administrative decision in public administration. The end of the administrative decision must be justified in detail according to the legal regulations. Expert systems do this. The other large group of AI tools, solutions based on machine learning, act as black boxes, mapping input data to output data, so the reason for the solution is unknown. Therefore, these tools are not suitable for direct, administrative decision, but can support office work with expert systems. In this article, we present the operation of expert systems through examples. © 2021 Brepols Publishers.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey strategy was used in this study to collect data from 225 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) respondents who were on the registered list of the Ghana Enterprise Agency in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Structural equation modeling – path analysis was used to estimate the impact of AIM on the performance of SMEs. Findings: The analyzed data shows that AIM has significant impact on the financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance in the case of SMEs in Ghana. This study establishes the significance of AIM approach in achieving financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance through the application of AIM determinants including, Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative decision-making systems (CDMS), virtual and augmented reality (VAR) and personalization. Research limitations/implications: Aside the aforementioned significance of this research study, this study has limitations. The sample size of this research study can be expanded to include SME respondents in other geographical areas that were not considered in this study. Future research studies should concentrate on how AIM can analyze customer communications and information such as posts on social media to develop future communications that may enhance customer engagement. Practical implications: The practical implications comprise of two key items. First, this research study encourages SME owners and managers to develop an AIM method as a fundamental strategic goal in their pursuit to improve SME performance. Second, SME owners and managers should increasingly implement the four determinants of AIM indicated in this research study (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) to develop essential resources for effective application of AIM to improve their performance. Originality/value: The results of this study provide a strong support to RBV theory and the proposition that AIM and its determinants (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) should be recognized as an essential strategic resource for improving the performance (i.e., financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance) of SMEs. This study also contributes to the current body of knowledge on AIM and management, particularly in the context of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence in marketing (AIM); Business organization performance; Emerging economy; SMEs","","","","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi K., The impact of innovative marketing on the performance of Ghanaian food processing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), (2020); Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Amer F., Hammoud S., Khatatbeh H., Lohner S., Boncz I., Endrei D., The deployment of balanced scorecard in health care organizations: is it beneficial?

Accordingly, this study investigates the approaches that AI can be used for enabling B2B marketing innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Applying a bibliometric research method, this study systematically investigates the literature regarding AI-enabled B2B marketing. It synthesises state-of-the-art knowledge from 221 journal articles published between 1990 and 2021. Findings: Apart from offering specific information regarding the most influential authors and most frequently cited articles, the study further categorises the use of AI for innovation in B2B marketing into five domains, identifying the main trends in the literature and suggesting directions for future research. Practical implications: Through the five identified domains, practitioners can assess their current use of AI and identify their future needs in the relevant domains in order to make appropriate decisions on how to invest in AI. Thus, the research enables companies to realise their digital marketing innovation strategies through AI. Originality/value: The research represents one of the first large-scale reviews of relevant literature on AI in B2B marketing by (1) obtaining and comparing the most influential works based on a series of analyses; (2) identifying five domains of research into how AI can be used for facilitating B2B marketing innovation and (3) classifying relevant articles into five different time periods in order to identify both past trends and future directions in this specific field. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on components of perceived risk, consumer trust theory, and consumption value theory, a research model was proposed and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) with data from 482 voice shoppers. Findings: The results reveal that, unlike risks associated with physical harm, privacy breaches, and security threats, a variety of other concerns—including financial, psychological, social, performance-related risks, time loss, and the overall perceived risks—significantly influence consumers' willingness to accept VAs purchase recommendations. The effect is mediated by trust in VA purchase recommendations and their perceived value. Different types of risk affect various consumption values, with functional value being the most influential. The model explains 58.6% of the variance in purchase recommendation acceptance and significantly elucidates the variance in all consumption values. Originality/value: This study contributes crucial knowledge to understanding consumer decision-making processes as they increasingly leverage AI-powered voice-based dialogue platforms for online purchasing. It emphasizes recognizing diverse risk typologies associated with VA purchase recommendations and their impact on consumer purchase behavior. The findings offer insights for marketing managers seeking to navigate the challenges posed by consumers' perceived risks while leveraging VAs as an integral component of modern shopping environments. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Recommendation; Risk; Trust; Value; Voice assistant; Voice shopping","","","","","","","","Ahn J., Kim J., Sung Y., The effect of gender stereotypes on artificial intelligence recommendations, Journal of Business Research, 141, pp. 50-59, (2022); Alrawad M., Lutfi A., Alyatama S., Al Khattab A., Alsoboa S.S., Almaiah M.A., Ramadan M.H., Arafa H.M., Ahmed N.A., Alsyouf A., Al-Khasawneh A.L., Assessing customers perception of online shopping risks: a structural equation modeling–based multigroup analysis, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 71, (2023); Aw E.C.-X., Tan G.W.-H., Cham T.-H., Raman R., Ooi K.-B., Alexa, what's on my shopping list?

A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

While acknowledging the capabilities of AI chatbots to handle customer interactions and improve response times, we critically examine several challenges they present, including interoperability challenges, data protection concerns, and biased output. This research presents a novel framework for managers to assess a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM), which has been adapted to account for the critical challenges associated with the emerging technology. Incorporating four factors—subjective norms, compatibility, facilitating conditions, and trust—allows for a more holistic assessment of a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology. The framework, together with a readiness assessment tool, provides a comprehensive mechanism for managerial decision-making, focusing on the adoption of AI chatbots in customer service, sales, and marketing business functions. In exploring these factors, our article explores the managerial implications of integrating AI chatbots into business processes, ensuring an informed and holistic approach to technology adoption. © 2024 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Artificial intelligence;

Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods","","","","","","","","Birant D, Data mining using RFM analysis, Knowledge-oriented applications in data mining (IntechOpen), (2011); Chang CJ, A Decision Support System for Audit Staff Scheduling of Multiple and Large-Scaled Engagements, Rev Bus Inf Syst, 6, pp. 27-40, (2002); De Haan E, Wiesel T, Pauwels K, The effectiveness of different forms of online advertising for purchase conversion in a multiple-channel attribution framework, Int J Res Mark, 33, pp. 491-507, (2016); Dodin B, Huang Chan K, Application of production scheduling methods to external and internal audit scheduling, Eur J Oper Res, 52, pp. 267-279, (1991); Edvardsson B, Gustafsson A, Roos I, Service portraits in service research: a critical review, International J Serv Ind Manage, 16, pp. 107-121, (2005); Grewala D, Roggeveen AL, Understanding Retail Experiences and Customer Journey Management, J Retailing, 96, pp. 3-8, (2020); Han DL, Tang LC, Huang HC, A Markov model for single-leg air cargo revenue management under a bid-price policy, Eur J Oper Res, 200, pp. 800-811, (2010); He B, Shi Y, Wan Q, Et al., Prediction of customer attrition of commercial banks based on SVM model, Pro Comput Sci, 31, pp. 423-430, (2014); Huang CY, Shen YC, Chiang IP, Et al., Characterizing Web users’ online information behavior, J Am Society Inf Sci Technol, 58, pp. 1988-1997, (2007); Klein R, Sebastian K, Steinhardt C, Et al., A review of revenue management: Recent generalizations and advances in industry applications, Eur J Oper Res, 284, pp. 397-412, (2020); Kraus M, Feuerriegel S, Oztekin A, Deep learning in business analytics and operations research: Models, applications and managerial implications, Eur J Oper Res, 281, pp. 628-641, (2020); Lemon KN, Verhoef PC, Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey, J Mark, 80, (2016); Mainak S, Bruyn AD, LSTM Response Models for Direct Marketing Analytics: Replacing Feature Engineering with Deep Learning, J Interact Mark, 53, pp. 80-95, (2021); Strauss AK, Klein R, Steinhardt C, A review of choice-based revenue management: Theory and methods, Eur J Oper Res, 271, pp. 375-387, (2018); Sun C, Adamopoulos P, Ghose A, Et al., Predicting stages in omnichannel path to purchase: A deep learning model, Inf Syst Res, 33, pp. 429-445, (2022)","T.-C.

Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R&D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company’s management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company’s growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm’s commercialization strategy. For the last years, the KIBO Patent Appraisal System (KPAS-II) herein proposed has been advanced by KIBO as a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI) and evaluation data applications valuation system that automatically calculates and estimates a technology’s feasible economic value by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic index information of a patent and the commercialization entity’s business ca-pabilities, and by applying to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method in valuation theory, and finally integrating with deep learning results based on the in-advance previously established patent DB and the financial DB. The KPAS-II proposed in this study can be said to have dramatically overcome the long-term preparation period and high levels of R&D and commercialization costs in terms of the limitations that the existing technology valuation method possesses by enhancing the reliability of approximate economic values from the deep learning results based on financial data and completed valuation data. In addition, it is expected that technology marketing coordinators, researchers, and non-specialty business agents, not limited to valuation experts, can easily estimate the economic values of their patents or technologies, and they can be actively utilized in a technology-based company’s decision-making and technologically dependent financial activities. © 2021 by the authors.

It could be convergence (simultaneous utilization during the same entrepreneurial processes with the emphasis on unique features by the terms of the competition) or divergence (usage during different business processes by the terms of labor division). Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the influence of usage of human capital and AI on the efficiency of social entrepreneurship. The authors identify the perspective directions of usage of AI in social entrepreneurship and evaluate the readiness and interest in the implementation of these directions of concerned parties. The authors also model the optimal proportions and the variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in the future (until 2030). Findings: It is found that social entrepreneurship will use the opportunities of Industry 4.0 for optimization of its activities until 2030, but will refuse from full automatization, using human intellect and AI at the same time. Originality/value: The most perspective directions of application of AI at social companies are a collection of social goods and services, marketing studies and promotion of social goods and services. Neither convergence nor divergence of human and artificial intellectual capital does not fully conform to the interests of concerned parties. The most preferable (optimal) variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the Industry 4.0 is human intelligent decision support. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI; Digital personnel; Intellectual capital; Social entrepreneurship","","","","","","Russian Fund of Fundamental Research, (18-010-00103 A.)"," The research was performed with financial support from the Russian Fund of Fundamental Research within the scientific project No. 18-010-00103 A.

Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics","Artificial intelligence; Environmental management; Location; Product design; Purchasing; Sales; Autonomous learning; Consumer evaluation; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Environmental problems; Environmental sustainability; Hierarchical linear modeling; Need for cognitions; Sustainable development","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16K13396, 19K21707, 20H01554); Waseda University, (2019C-152)","The author is grateful to all survey respondents and to Yang Yang and Shan Zheng for their contributions to the data collection.

Although the role of AI in Fashion has been studied before, the aim of this research is to challenge and analyze the attitudes towards sustainable fashion of both stakeholders and consumers. The research considers the views of consumers, industry professionals and company shareholders on the role AI plays in pursuing ideas of Sustainable Fashion. Contrary to expectations, the companies with significant turnover did not show any greater awareness of the new trends in the fashion business. Furthermore, previous familiarity with the usage of AI did not prove to promote openness towards the recommendation of apps which use AI to promote Sustainable Fashion. The value of this research lies in the findings, which help provide a framework which can be used to change the viewpoint of the key market players. The crucial finding is that the AI approach on sustainability will influence both users (changing their purchasing decisions toward more sustainable choices if provided with a set of information on ecological impact, production choices), and corporate businesses (changing the overall business strategy, planning, marketing communication and production designs). The paper offers milestones for further research on synergies between AI, fashion industry lined with UNS SDGs and purchasing behavior. © 2022 by the authors.","AI smart apps; business models; customer experience; efficiency; environment; fashion industry; Industry 4.0; innovation; pollution; sustainability","business service; environment; innovation; pollution; sustainability","","","","","","","AI in Fashion Market by Solutions & Services—2022; Golam S., Bolesnikov M., A study of digital marketing strategies adopted by chemical industries, GBIS, (2021); Silvestri B., The Future of Fashion: How the Quest for Digitization and the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Extended Reality Will Reshape the Fashion Industry after COVID-19, ZMJ, 10, pp. 61-73, (2020); Wazarkar S., Patil S., Kumar S., A Bibliometric Survey of Fashion Analysis using Artificial Intelligence, Libr.

However, this exhilaration is being tempered by growing concerns about the moral and legal implications of using AI in marketing. Although previous research has revealed various ethical and legal issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and data privacy, there are no definitive answers. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating AI’s ethical and legal concerns in marketing and suggesting feasible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper synthesises information from academic articles, industry reports, case studies and legal documents through a thematic literature review. A qualitative analysis approach categorises and interprets ethical and legal challenges and proposes potential solutions. Findings: The findings of this paper raise concerns about ethical and legal challenges related to AI in the marketing area. Ethical concerns related to discrimination, bias, manipulation, job displacement, absence of social interaction, cybersecurity, unintended consequences, environmental impact, privacy and legal issues such as consumer security, responsibility, liability, brand protection, competition law, agreements, data protection, consumer protection and intellectual property rights are discussed in the paper, and their potential solutions are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding the interesting insights gathered from this investigation of the ethical and legal consequences of AI in marketing, it is important to recognise the limits of this research. Initially, the focus of this study is confined to a review of the most important ethical and legal issues pertaining to AI in marketing. Additional possible repercussions, such as those associated with intellectual property, contracts and licencing, should be investigated more deeply in future studies. Despite the fact that this study gives various answers and best practices for tackling the stated ethical and legal concerns, the viability and efficacy of these solutions may differ depending on the context and industry. Thus, more research and case studies are required to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of these solutions in other circumstances. This research is mostly based on a literature review and may not represent the experiences or opinions of all stakeholders engaged in AI-powered marketing. Further study might involve interviews or surveys with marketing professionals, customers and other key stakeholders to offer a full knowledge of the practical difficulties and solutions. Because of the rapid speed of technical progress, AI’s ethical and regulatory ramifications in marketing are continually increasing. Consequently, this work should be a springboard for more research and continuing conversations on this subject. Practical implications: This study’s findings have several practical implications for marketing professionals. Emphasising openness and explainability: Marketing professionals should prioritise transparency in their use of AI, ensuring that customers are fully informed about data collection and utilisation for targeted advertising. By promoting openness and explainability, marketers can foster customer trust and avoid the negative consequences of a lack of transparency. Establishing ethical guidelines: Marketing professionals need to develop ethical rules for the creation and implementation of AI-powered marketing strategies. Adhering to ethical principles ensures compliance with legal norms and aligns with the organisation’s values and ideals. Investing in bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology: To mitigate risks associated with AI in marketing, marketers should allocate resources to develop and implement bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology. These tools can identify and address biases in AI algorithms, safeguard consumer privacy and extract valuable insights from consumer data. Social implications: This study’s social implications emphasise the need for a comprehensive approach to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing. This includes adopting a responsible innovation framework, promoting ethical leadership, using ethical decision-making frameworks and conducting multidisciplinary research. By incorporating these approaches, marketers can navigate the complexities of AI in marketing responsibly, foster an ethical organisational culture, make informed ethical decisions and develop effective solutions. Such practices promote public trust, ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk, and mitigate potential negative social consequences associated with AI in marketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is among the first to explore potential solutions comprehensively. This paper provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges by using a multidisciplinary framework and synthesising various sources. It contributes valuable insights for academia and industry. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI in marketing; Artificial intelligence; Ethical challenges; Legal implications; Marketing; Solution proposals","","","","","","","","Aloqaily M., Kanhere S., Bellavista P., Nogueira M., Special issue on cybersecurity management in the era of AI, Journal of Network and Systems Management, 30, 3, (2022); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., The evolution of Fintech: a new post-crisis paradigm?, Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, 4, pp. 1271-1319, (2016); Borenstein J., Howard A., Emerging challenges in AI and the need for AI ethics education, AI and Ethics, 1, 1, pp. 61-65, (2021); Brown M.E., Trevino L.K., Ethical leadership: a review and future directions, The Leadership Quarterly, 17, 6, pp. 595-616, (2006); Brynjolfsson E., Mitchell T., What can machine learning do?

However, many existing AI chatbots have yet to meet the expectations of solo travelers, especially when they demand more personalized information to assist in travel decision-making. Based on complexity theory, this research examines the factors that stimulate solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, particularly covering the three main aspects of marketing efforts, communication quality, and affective characteristics. Drawing from a sample of 281 solo travelers, partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used to examine the proposed relationships. The PLS-SEM results illustrate that interaction, entertainment, trendiness, communication competence, and satisfaction have significant direct effects on purchase intentions. The fsQCA results further revealed four solutions exhibiting high purchase intentions among solo travelers. Different core, peripheral, and necessary causal conditions in each configuration path were identified. The findings enrich the AI chatbot literature by examining the underlying reasons why solo travelers react differently to this emerging technology and produce practical recommendations for designing AI chatbot systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","AI chatbot; fsQCA; PLS-SEM; Purchase intentions; Solo travelers; Tourism","","","","","","","","Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., Chatbots: History, technology, and applications, Machine Learning with Applications, 2, pp. 1-18, (2020); Aguilera-Caracuel J., Fedriani E.M., Delgado-Marquez B.L., Institutional distance among country influences and environmental performance standardization in multinational enterprises, Journal of Business Research, 67, 11, pp. 2385-2392, (2014); Alonso-Vazquez M., Yang E.C.L., Pages Vidal M.D.M., Khoo C., Going solo during the pandemic: A generational segmentation of solo female travellers, Current Issues in Tourism, pp. 1-15, (2023); Azali M., Kamal Basha N., Chang Y.S., Lim X.J., Cheah J.H., Why not travel to Malaysia?

Given these recent threats to consumer privacy and autonomy, and considering autonomy as the ultimate outcome of privacy, I propose that a reconceptualization is warranted to reflect contemporary consumer privacy challenges and to realign the concept with its theoretical foundations. To this end, I introduce the dimension of decisional privacy, focused on autonomy versus interference in consumer decision-making. Building on previous privacy literature and extending previous theorizing about information privacy and decisional privacy as complementary, I posit that these two dimensions of privacy together comprise consumer privacy. Addressing protection from interference as an under-communicated function of consumer privacy, the paper aims to clarify, exemplify, and engage in the conceptual development of decisional privacy in the context of consumer decision-making online. In addition to its significance for consumer wellbeing and democracy collectively, the extension of consumer privacy to explicitly encompass interference has theoretical implications for privacy concern, the proxy used to measure privacy, yielding important insights for marketing scholars and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2024.","Autonomy;

Meaning, nobody looks beyond the first page of search results. In a cookie-free future, search engines double down on how marketers communicate expertise, authority, and trust. This pushes brands to shift away from product-focused search engine marketing, toward an intent-based approach. To stay at the top of search engine results, marketers must understand consumer assessment of search results. Guided by an integrated framework combining UTAUT2, theory of reasoned action, and media richness theory, this empirical study used a 2 (search result type: organic vs. sponsored) × 3 (presentation format: text-only vs. image vs. video) between-subjects research design for assessing the effects of search results on consumer decisions. Results help establish the connection between consumer perceptions of search results and purchase decisions. Implications for AI-driven search engine marketing are presented. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attribution optimization; data-driven marketing; pay per click; search engine advertising;

Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3). Originality/value: Anthropomorphizing AI has undeniable relevance in the contemporary marketing landscape, such as humanoid robotics and emotion AI algorithms. Despite of anthropomorphism's significance and relevance, the downstream impact of anthropomorphism remains unfortunately underexplored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence (AI); Political ideology; Psychological closeness; Psychological risk attachment; Risk aversion","","","","","","","","Abdulquadri A., Mogaji E., Kieu T.A., Nguyen N.P., Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Acikgoz F., Vega R.P., The role of privacy cynicism in consumer habits with voice assistants: a Technology Acceptance Model perspective, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, pp. 1-15, (2022); Aggarwal P., McGill A.L., Is that car smiling at me?

With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision-making literature. Moreover, this study makes practical implications for marketers of AI businesses including those who strategically use AI-generated information. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","AI adoption; AI technology; artificial intelligence; marketing; preciseness; recommendation; trust","","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 6, pp. 734-749, (2005); Aguirre E., Mahr D., Grewal D., de Ruyter K., Wetzels M., Unraveling the personalization paradox: The effect of information collection and trust-building strategies on online advertisement effectiveness, Journal of Retailing, 91, 1, pp. 34-49, (2015); Aljukhadar M., Trifts V., Senecal S., Consumer self-construal and trust as determinants of the reactance to a recommender advice, Psychology & Marketing, 34, 7, pp. 708-719, (2017); Amoroso D., Sauer F., Sharkey N., Suchman L., Tamburrini G., Autonomy in weapon systems: The military application of artificial intelligence as a litmus test for Germany's new foreign and security policy, (2018); Bart Y., Shankar V., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

AI advances could conceivably automate everything: marketing, customer service, underwriting and claims management alike. However, such automation challenges consumer trust, as there is considerable public and scholarly debate over the ‘black box’ character of many algorithms. Insurance being a business of trust, this suggests a dilemma. One suggested solution involves adopting algorithms in a transparent manner. This article reports a study of how Swedish insurers deal with this dilemma, based on (i) eight interviews with insurance professionals representing four companies with a joint market share of 45–50% of the Swedish property insurance market and (ii) a questionnaire answered by 71 professionals in a Swedish insurance company. The results show that while transparency is seen as potentially valuable, most Swedish insurers do not use it to gain a competitive advantage or identify clear limits to transparency and are not using AI extensively. © 2021, The Geneva Association.","Competitive advantage; Insurance; Openness; Sweden; Transparency; Trust","","","","","","Stiftelsen Länsförsäkringsbolagens Forskningsfond, (P4/18)","","Abdul A.J., Vermeulen D., Wang B.Y., Limkankanhalli M., Trends and trajectories for explainable, accountable and intelligible systems: An HCI research agenda, Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-18, (2018); Adams J.E., Highhouse S., Zickar M.J., Understanding general distrust of corporations, Corporate Reputation Review, 13, 1, (2010); Adebayo J.J., Gilmer M., Muelly I., Goodfellow M., Hardtkim B., Sanity checks for saliency maps, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 9505-9515, (2018); Andrews R., Diederich J., Tickle A.B., Survey and critique of techniques for extracting rules from trained artificial neural networks, Knowledge-Based Systems, 8, 6, pp. 373-389, (1995); Atchinson B.K., Walking the talk: Ethics as corporate culture, The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice, 29, 1, pp. 40-44, (2004); Barakat N., Bradley A.P., Rule extraction from support vector machines: A review, Neurocomputing, 74, 1-3, pp. 178-190, (2010); Bhaduri G., Ha-Brookshire J.E., Do transparent business practices pay?

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research based on exploratory in-depth interviews with industry experts currently working with artificial intelligence tools. Findings: Key themes include: (1) Importance of AI in strategic marketing decision management; (2) Presence of AI in strategic decision management; (3) Role of AI in strategic decision management; (4) Importance of business culture for the use of AI; (5) Impact of AI on the business’ organizational model. A key consideration is a “creative-possibility perspective,” highlighting the future potential to use AI not only for rational but also for creative thinking purposes. Research limitations/implications: This work is focused only on strategy creation as a deliberate process. For this, AI can be used as an effective response to the external contingencies of high volumes of data and uncertain environmental conditions, as well as being an effective response to the external contingencies of limited managerial cognition. A key future consideration is a “creative-possibility perspective.” Practical implications: A practical extension of the Gartner Analytics Ascendancy Model (Maoz, 2013). Originality/value: This paper aims to contribute knowledge relating to the role of AI in marketing strategy formulation and explores the potential avenues for future use of AI in the strategic marketing process. This is explored through the lens of contingency theory, and additionally, findings are expressed using the Gartner analytics ascendancy model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Creativity; Marketing strategy; Rationality; TQM/Marketing synergy","Commerce; Marketing; Strategic planning; Artificial intelligence tools; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental conditions; In-depth interviews; Managerial cognitions; Organizational modeling; Qualitative research; Strategic marketing; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Italian government","It is important to understand how AI enables different types of knowledge to appropriately select and use the potential of AI to manage knowledge (). With this work, the authors hope to add knowledge and research opportunities relating to the use of AI for strategy creation. The results provide evidence that AI can augment, replace, or complement the human decision-making process () for marketing strategy creation. It especially serves to further highlight the potential of a complementary relationship between managers and machines (). The research has provided empirical evidence that AI can be a tool for marketing strategy creation. One area emerging from the interviews is what the article suggests to call a creative-possibility perspective. The authors hope this creative-possibility perspective provides an avenue to further study how managers can partner with AI in strategy formulation activities. Further, the expert interviews highlight the opportunity from a business school curriculum perspective. They identified how many organizations are not yet ready for the change AI entails. The main factor to help in facilitating change is the creation of a link between universities and industry. For example, in Italy, this has commenced through a series of projects funded by the Italian government, and the creation of eight competence centers. Evidence provided regarding AI can be a tool for marketing strategy creation and may form input to future business school initiatives and partnerships.

Ltd., a rapidly growing digital marketing and automation service provider in India. CEO Jacob faced concern after presenting to a major client, Pragati, the founder of Villuvia.com, one of India’s top online jewellery brands. While email marketing had been a core strategy since the beginning, its return on investment had dwindled compared to social media advertising, exacerbated by a recent overhaul introducing a new digital marketing team. They excelled in social media but were new to email marketing software. Caspar Technologies unveiled cMercury, an AI-based technology to streamline email marketing campaigns. Although initial tests showed promise, it came at a five-fold cost compared to traditional email management software, which demanded extensive manual intervention. Jacob considered offering Villuvia a discount for the festive season but awaited Pragati’s decision. This would determine whether their budget would be allocated to email marketing, social media, or offline expansion. This case allows students to delve into email marketing intricacies, assess metrics and make quantitative evaluations. It also presents a platform for qualitative discussions on managerial dilemmas, like evaluating the digital team’s capabilities, prioritizing customer acquisition or retention and gauging the long-term viability of AI-powered email communication. © 2023 Lahore University of Management Sciences.","cMercury; digital marketing; email marketing; precision marketing; predictive email","","","","","","","","","K.

The data underwent analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), which allowed us to perform various analysis methods, such as ANOVA analysis to establish statistically significant relationships between the independent variables. The analysis indicates that AI-driven informativeness and AI-based recommendations have a significant influence on travel decision-making. On the other hand, social media does not have a significant impact on travel decision-making. However, for tourism product selling, customer purchase behavior and online tourism marketing have a significant impact, whereas learning new strategies does not affect tourism product selling. © 2024 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.","Artificial intelligence; tourism; tourism industry; tourism product selling; travel; travel decision making","artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; decision making; electronic commerce; marketing; social media; tourist behavior; travel behavior","","","","","","","Almomani A., Saavedra P., Barreiro P., Duran R., Crujeiras R., Loureiro M., Sanchez E., Application of choice models in tourism recommender systems, Expert Systems, 40, 3, pp. 1-18, (2023); Angeloni S., Rossi C., Online search engines and online travel agencies: A comparative approach, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 45, 4, pp. 720-749, (2021); Argo J.J., A contemporary review of three types of social influence in consumer psychology, Consumer Psychology Review, 3, 1, pp. 126-140, (2020); Assaker G., Age and gender differences in online travel reviews and user-generated-content (UGC) adoption: Extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with credibility theory, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 29, 4, pp. 428-449, (2020); Assaker G., Hallak R., El-Haddad R., Consumer usage of online travel reviews: Expanding the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 model, Journal of Vacation Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 149-165, (2020); Baron J., Koehler D., Harvey N., Normative models of judgment and decision making, Blackwell handbook of judgment and decision making, pp. 1-27, (2004); Borras J., Moreno A., Valls A., Intelligent tourism recommender systems: A survey, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 16, pp. 7370-7389, (2014); Bostrom N., Yudkowsky E., The ethics of artificial intelligence, Artificial intelligence safety and security, pp. 57-69, (2014); Bulchand-Gidumal J., Impact of artificial intelligence in travel, tourism, and hospitality, Handbook of e-tourism, pp. 1943-1962, (2022); Chang Y., Hou R.J., Wang K., Cui A.P., Zhang C.B., Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on social loafing in online travel communities, Computers in Human Behavior, 109, (2020); Chen Y.C., Shang R.A., Li M.J., The effects of perceived relevance of travel blogs’ content on the behavioral intention to visit a tourist destination, Computers in Human Behavior, 30, pp. 787-799, (2014); Choi Y., Hickerson B., Lee J., Lee H., Choe Y., Digital tourism and wellbeing: Conceptual framework to examine technology effects of online travel media, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 9, (2022); Dwityas N.A., Briandana R., Social media in travel decision making process, International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 7, 7, pp. 193-201, (2017); Grundner L., Neuhofer B., The bright and dark sides of artificial intelligence: A futures perspective on tourist destination experiences, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 19, (2021); Ivanov S., Webster C., Economic fundamentals of the use of robots, artificial intelligence, and service automation in travel, tourism, and hospitality, Robots, artificial intelligence, and service automation in travel, tourism and hospitality, pp. 39-55, (2019); Ivanov S., Webster C., Robots, artificial intelligence and service automation in travel, tourism and hospitality, (2019); Jin L., Hu B., Influencing factors of online products decision-making oriented to tourism economy under the guidance of consumer psychology, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2022); Jin Q., Hu H., Su X., Morrison A.M., The influence of the characteristics of online itinerary on purchasing behavior, Land, 10, 9, (2021); Kim J., Giroux M., Park J., Lee J.C., An evolutionary perspective in tourism: The role of socioeconomic status on extremeness aversion in travel decision making, Journal of Travel Research, 61, 5, pp. 1187-1200, (2022); Liu X., Mehraliyev F., Liu C., Schuckert M., The roles of social media in tourists’ choices of travel components, Tourist Studies, 20, 1, pp. 27-48, (2020); Mirehie M., Gibson H.J., Buning R.J., Coble C., Flaherty M., Towards an understanding of family travel decision-making processes in the context of youth sport tourism, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 21, (2021); Samala N., Katkam B.S., Bellamkonda R.S., Rodriguez R.V., Impact of AI and robotics in the tourism sector: A critical insight, Journal of Tourism Futures, 8, 1, pp. 73-87, (2020); Stylos N., Technological evolution and tourist decision-making: A perspective article, Tourism Review, 75, 1, pp. 273-278, (2020); Tileaga C., Oana O., The importance of selling techniques in the tourism industry, Revista Economica, 70, 2, (2018)","Z.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next wave of transformation in healthcare. This study aims to understand patient perceptions of AI and its impact on value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed to investigate how value co-creation operant resources (digital self-efficacy and relational service quality) impact value co-creation engagement (shared decision-making) and value co-creation outcomes (anticipatory AI value co-creation and intention to adopt AI). Data were collected from 332 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that the value co-creation process for AI technologies is a function of inputs, experiences and AI outputs. Operant resources were found to be positively associated with shared decision-making. However, not all operant resources directly and positively impacted AI outcomes. The indirect and positive mediated relationships through shared decision-making to AI outcomes suggest an interactive AI value co-creation process. Research limitations/implications: AI technologies are still in early stages of consumer adoption in healthcare. Future research is warranted that investigates the validity of the model through maturing service life cycles. Practical implications: Customer perceptions of new digital innovations are formed in the context of previous digital experiences. Marketers need to understand how customers view their current non-AI technologies. Strong engagement and perceived value of current technologies will help ease customers into the usage of AI technologies. Originality/value: This study investigates the unique stages of the value co-creation process for AI technologies in healthcare. The results demonstrate that the value co-creation process is a function of inputs, tech-enabled experiences and AI outputs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Digital transformation; Healthcare; Service-dominant logic; Services marketing","","","","","","","","Abid M.F., Shamim A., Khan Z., Khan I., Value creation or value destruction: conceptualizing the experiential nature of value-in-use, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 21, 3, pp. 583-601, (2022); Akbar P., Mai R., Hoffmann S., When do materialistic consumers join commercial sharing systems, Journal of Business Research, 69, 10, pp. 4215-4224, (2016); Akaka M.A., Parry G., Value-in-context: an exploration of the context of value and the value of context, Handbook of Service Science, 2, pp. 457-477, (2019); Barile S., Bassano C., Piciocchi P., Saviano M., Spohrer J.C., Empowering value co-creation in the digital age, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, (2021); Barnes S., De Ruyter K., Guest editorial: artificial intelligence as a market-facing technology: getting closer to the consumer through innovation and insight, European Journal of Marketing, 56, 6, pp. 1585-1589, (2022); Chandler J.D., Vargo S.L., Contextualization and value-in-context: how context frames exchange, Marketing Theory, 11, 1, pp. 35-49, (2011); Dahl A.J., Milne G.R., Peltier J.W., Digital health information seeking in an omni-channel environment: a shared decision-making and service-dominant logic perspective, Journal of Business Research, 125, pp. 840-850, (2021); Dahl A.J., Peltier J.W., Milne G.R., Development of a value co-creation wellness model: the role of physicians and digital information seeking on health behaviors and health outcomes, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 52, 3, pp. 562-594, (2018); Dahl A.J., Peltier J.W., Milne G.R., Reducing information asymmetry and increasing health value co-creation in a rural healthcare context, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 56, 2, pp. 512-535, (2022); Dahl A.J., Peltier J.W., Swan E.L., Anticipatory value-in-use in early-stage digital health service transformations: how consumers assess value propositions before and after abrupt, exogenous shocks, Journal of Business Research, 163, (2023); Dodds S., Russell-Bennett R., Chen T., Oertzen A.-S., Salvador-Carulla L., Hung Y.-C., Blended human-technology service realities in healthcare, Journal of Service Theory and Practice, 32, 1, pp. 75-99, (2022); Gao L., Li G., Tsai F., Gao C., Zhu M., Qu X., The impact of artificial intelligence stimuli on customer engagement and value co-creation: the moderating role of customer ability readiness, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 317-333, (2023); Gronroos C., Service logic revisited: who creates value?

This was achieved through a cross-priority ranking analysis, which identified trends in the development of digital technologies in marketing communications and global marketing. Data from 25 expert organisations was used to form a set of 32 digital solutions. Using a developed methodology, these solutions were ranked, revealing the top 6 with the highest potential for transforming marketing communications. The rankings showed a discrepancy between the mentioned frequency ranking and the priority ranking, indicating the influence of marketing organizations' experience. Currently, social media platforms, particularly influencer marketing, are closely integrated with e-commerce, explaining their high mention frequency. However, a cross-ranking analysis revealed a trend towards AI technologies in marketing communications processes. It has been established that obtaining credit funds for the deployment of modernized marketing campaigns and strategies impacts the financial security of such organizations. Moreover, the utilization of optimal conversion-oriented digital marketing tools allows for a significant reduction in financial risks and an increase in the profitability of companies. The study further identified the future direction of global marketing development, which involves immersive strategies that deeply integrate and extensively use AI technologies. These strategies aim to enhance consumer interest and engagement. The practicality of this research lies in its ability to assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions and reducing the risks of misdirected investments. Further research is recommended to explore practical mechanisms for implementing the identified digital solutions in global marketing processes. This would involve developing a detailed strategy aligned with these technologies. © 2023 by the author(s).","AI & ML; Big Data & Analytics; extended reality; FinTech; influencer marketing; interactive content marketing; MarTech; reduction of financial and credit risks; social commerce; voice marketing; VR/AR/MR; web analytics","","","","","","","","Mageplaza, (2023); Al-Dmour H.

With a focus on enhancing product and service quality, we investigate the intricate relationships among these variables. A quantitative approach involving 380 supply chain professionals reveals that heightened inventory competition, increased AI adoption, and robust digital marketing significantly contribute to quality enhancement initiatives. The study builds upon prior research by empirically validating these connections and offers practical insights for supply chain practitioners. The findings underscore the strategic imperative of organizations to strategically balance these factors to optimize their quality management strategies, fostering customer satisfaction and competitiveness. While offering valuable contributions, the study acknowledges limitations in terms of self-reported data and a specific respondent group. Future research could extend this investigation to diverse industries and geographical contexts. In the end, this study sheds light on the complex interplay that exists between inventory competition, the use of AI, digital marketing, and judgments about quality improvement. As a result, a road map has been provided for efficient quality management of supply chains in the digital age. © 2023 Growing Science Ltd.

Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived. Marketers should optimize the mix and timing of AI-HI marketing team, consumers should understand the complementarity between AI and HI strengths for informed consumption decisions, and researchers can investigate innovative approaches to and boundary conditions of collaborative intelligence. © 2021 New York University","Artificial intelligence; Augmentation; Collaborative AI; Collaborative intelligence; Replacement","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","This research was supported by grants (106-2410-H-002-056-MY3 and 107-2410-H-002-115-MY3) from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Antons D., Breidbach C.F., Big Data, Big Insights?

As such, online communities that are supported by AI technologies creating new knowledge from consumer interactions through platforms like social media as consumers share experiences on specific products or services. Since AI is designed to &#x201C;learn&#x201D; and improve with data generated from digital technologies linked to consumer interactions, AI relies on consumer knowledge-sharing (KS) activities to replicate new knowledge for product and service improvement. However, given the knowledge gap in this area, this article applies the fsQCA technique to data generated from 291 participants to develop CB metaframework predicted on the concepts of AI, CB, and KS. Our results suggest that AI advances consumer attitudes and behaviors when knowledge is acquired while online communities promote curiosity and engage consumers to learn by sharing experiences about specific products or services. Furthermore, understanding the causality between AI, CB, and KS concepts offers critical decision-making insights to marketing experts across the industry.

While numerous studies highlight increasing demand for diversity among some consumers, such enthusiasm is not universal. This is creating challenges for brands, some of which have faced backlash, either due to a perceived lack of authenticity in their diversity efforts or because not all consumer groups value diversity equally. Amidst these challenges, technological advancements, such as data-driven decision-making and generative AI, present both new opportunities and risks. The current literature on diverse representation in advertising, although expansive, is relatively siloed. Through a detailed eight-step process, we assess and synthesize the body of literature on diversity representation, reviewing 337 articles spanning research on age, beauty, body size, gender, LGBTQIA+ , physical and mental ability, and race and ethnicity. Our investigation offers two major contributions: a summarization of insights from the broader literature on these seven key areas of diverse representation and development of an integrated conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework details mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes that are either prevalent across the literature or can be reasonably expected to generalize across other forms of diversity. This framework not only offers a holistic perspective for academics and industry professionals but also exposes potential future research avenues. © 2023, The Author(s).","Advertising; DEI; Diversity; Equity; Inclusion; Marketing; Representation","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., Brumbaugh A.M., Grier S.A., Nontarget markets and viewer distinctiveness: The impact of target marketing on advertising attitudes, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 9, 3, pp. 127-140, (2000); Ahmed S., On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life, (2020); Akestam N., Rosengren S., Dahlen M., Think about it–can portrayals of homosexuality in advertising prime consumer-perceived social connectedness and empathy?, European Journal of Marketing, 51, 1, pp. 82-98, (2017); Akter S., Dwivedi Y.K., Sajib S., Biswas K., Bandara R.J., Michael K., Algorithmic bias in machine learning-based marketing models, Journal of Business Research, 144, pp. 201-216, (2022); Alfonseca K., Zahn M., How corporate America is slashing DEI workers amid backlash to diversity programs, ABC News, (2023); Bias-free language, American Psychological Association, (2020); Inclusive Language Guidelines [American Psychological Association], (2020); An D., Kim S., Relating Hofstede’s masculinity dimension to gender role portrayals in advertising: A cross-cultural comparison of web advertisements, International Marketing Review, 24, 2, pp. 181-207, (2007); Arsel Z., Crockett D., Scott M.L., Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the Journal of Consumer Research: A curation and research agenda, Journal of Consumer Research, 48, 5, pp. 920-933, (2022); Axelrod R., Effective choice in the prisoner’s dilemma, Journal of Conflict Resolution, 24, 1, pp. 3-25, (1980); Baah F.O., Teitelman A.M., Riegel B., Marginalization: Conceptualizing patient vulnerabilities in the framework of social determinants of health—An integrative review, Nursing Inquiry, 26, 1, (2019); Baek E., Lee H., Oh G.-E., Understanding East Asian consumers’ responses to inclusive beauty products in advertising, International Journal of Advertising, pp. 1-22, (2022); Baker A., Larcker D.F., McClure C., Saraph D., Watts E.M., Diversity Washing (SSRN Scholarly Paper No. 4298626), (2023); Bang H.-K., Reece B.B., Minorities in children’s television commercials: New, improved, and stereotyped, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 37, 1, pp. 42-67, (2003); Baxter S.M., Kulczynski A., Ilicic J., Ads aimed at dads: Exploring consumers’ reactions towards advertising that conforms and challenges traditional gender role ideologies, International Journal of Advertising, 35, 6, pp. 970-982, (2016); Becker M., Wiegand N., Reinartz W.J., Does it pay to be real?

Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings: Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers’ decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications: In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model. Originality/value: The change in consumer behavior leads to a change in the service marketing approach needed in the world of AI.

The research presents a case analysis of an award-winning Spot that uses artificial intelligence as the basis of the creative idea. Its objective is to assess the extent to which the implementation of this resource is pertinent in eliciting emotions, influencing brand awareness and perception, and fostering a favorable attitude towards the brand. For the analysis, a neuromarketing technique has been used, the Implicit Association Test, complemented with in-depth interviews and a CAWI survey. The results suggest that the use of AI in the creation of advertising messages favors the generation of positive attitudes toward the brand since it enhances the strength of the message transmitted, but it does not seem to influence the brand image or the intention to consume it. © 2023, Rey Juan Carlos University.

Failure to effect meaningful changes in this system could see these initiatives not reach their potential and lead to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their marketing campaigns. Systems thinking is often touted as a methodology to manage and effect change; however, there is little practical advice available for decision-makers to include systems thinking insights to work towards Responsible AI. Using the notion of ‘leverage zones’ adapted from the systems thinking literature, we suggest a novel approach to plan for and experiment with potential initiatives and interventions. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the Five Ps to help practitioners construct and identify holistic interventions that may work towards Responsible AI, from lower-order interventions such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating parameters, through to higher-order interventions such as redefining the system’s foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in the first place.

The integration of AI has brought numerous benefits to various functional areas within organizations, with marketing experiencing a significant positive impact. AI technologies have empowered marketers with advanced tools and insights, fostering unparalleled efficiency, personalization, and strategic campaign decision-making. Despite these advancements, the scholarly focus on AI's transformative effects on marketing is limited. This research investigates how AI is currently applied across different marketing functions and its potential future evolution and impact on marketing processes. In a rapidly evolving world, businesses must navigate complexity, innovate, and sustain competitive advantages. Grounding our analysis in previous AI marketing literature, we adopt the dynamic capability theoretical lens, emphasizing how organizations adapt and prosper in changing environments. This study highlights six key marketing areas where AI promises transformative effects, aiming to illuminate the path for future marketing innovations and strategies, including AI-driven customer insights, measuring marketing performance, automated marketing strategies, ethical implications, enhancing customer experiences, and growth opportunities with AI Implementation. While recognizing AI as a positive disruptive force, we also highlight its limitations, potential threats to privacy and security, as well as ramifications of biases, misuse, and dissemination of misinformation. Finally, the article delineates the gaps in the research and formulates questions aimed at advancing knowledge in AI marketing. © 2024 The Authors","AI marketing; Consumer behavior and decision making; Marketing activities; Marketing strategies; Research agenda","Commerce; Competition; Consumer behavior; Strategic planning; Artificial intelligence marketing; Artificial intelligence technologies; Business practices; Consumer behavior and decision making; Decisions makings; Functional areas; Marketing activities; Marketing strategy; Personalizations; Research agenda; Decision making","","","","","","","(2024); Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., Chatbots: History, Technology, and Applications, Machine Learning with Applications, 2, (2020); Adi E., Anwar A., Baig Z., Zeadally S., Machine learning and data analytics for the IOT, Neural Computing and Applications, 32, 20, pp. 16205-16233, (2020); Aflalo B., How AI Hasil evolved in the Marketing Industry – and where it's headed next ClickZ, (2020); Agarwal G.K., Magnusson M., Johanson A., Edge AI driven technology advancements paving way towards new capabilities, International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 18, 1, (2021); Allen D., Programmatic advertising: A simple explanation, Oracle Advertising Blog, (2019); Ameen N., Sharma G.D., Tarba S., Rao A., Chopra R., Toward advancing theory on creativity in marketing and artificial intelligence, Psychology & Marketing, 39, 9, pp. 1802-1825, (2022); Ameen N., Tarhini A., Reppel A., Anand A., Customer experiences in the age of artificial intelligence, Computers in Human Behavior, 114, (2021); Analytics Vidhya, Top 10 AI tools for data analysis, (2023); Analytics Vidhya, Top 14 marketing analytics tools for data-driven marketers, (2023); Anayat S., Rasool G., Artificial intelligence marketing (AIM): connecting-the-dots using bibliometrics, Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 32, 1, pp. 114-135, (2024); Arora N., Ensslen D., Fiedler L., Liu W.W., Robinson K., Stein E., Schuler G., The value of getting personalization right—or wrong—is multiplying, (2021); Arora S., ThoughtSpot, AI analytics explained: How it works and key Industry Use cases, (2023); Arsenijevic U., Jovic M., Artificial intelligence marketing: Chatbots, In 2019 international conference on artificial intelligence: Applications and innovations (IC-AIAI), pp. 19-193, (2019); Ashbridge Z.; Aw E.C.X., Tan G.W.H., Cham T.H., Raman R., Ooi K.B., Alexa, what's on my shopping list?

Firms thus lack insights into how to create and use emerging digital formats, individually or synergistically. To establish a holistic framework of bilateral multiformat communication for relationship marketing, this article reviews communication theory to establish a foundation for understanding multiformat communication and to identify any gaps (e.g., AI agents, simulated cues). The authors then review bilateral communication research in light of the identified theoretical gaps, to inform their framework. Finally, by decomposing these formats according to six fundamental characteristics, they predict how each characteristic might promote effective, efficient, and experiential communication goals, in light of distinct message, temporal, and dyadic factors. Ultimately, these combined insights reveal an overarching framework, with characteristic-level propositions grouped into five key themes, that can serve as a platform for academics and managers to develop multiformat communication theory and relationship strategies. © 2020, Academy of Marketing Science.","Communication strategy; Multichannel communication; Multiformat communication; Online relationships; Simulated cues","","","","","","","","Achen R.M., The influence of Facebook engagement on relationship quality and consumer behavior in the National Basketball Association, Journal of Relationship Marketing, 15, 4, pp. 247-268, (2016); Ahearne M., Gruen T.W., Jarvis C.B., If looks could sell: Moderation and mediation of the attractiveness effect on salesperson performance, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 16, 4, pp. 269-284, (1999); Altman I., The top 10 business trends that will drive success in 2018, (2017); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The future of social media in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Arnould E.J., Price L.L., River magic: Extraordinary experience and the extended service encounter, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 1, pp. 24-45, (1993); Bandyopadhyay S., Robicheaux R.A., Hill J.S., Cross-cultural differences in intrachannel communications: The United States and India, Journal of International Marketing, 2, 3, pp. 83-100, (1994); Barker L.L., Gaut D.R., Communication, (2002); Berger J., Word of mouth and interpersonal communication: A review and directions for future research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 586-607, (2014); Berger J., Iyengar R., Communication channels and word of mouth: How the medium shapes the message, Journal of Consumer Research, 40, 3, pp. 567-579, (2013); Bickmore T.W., Puskar K., Schlenk E.A., Pfeifer L.M., Sereika S.M., Maintaining reality: relational agents for antipsychotic medication adherence, Interacting with Computers, 22, 4, pp. 276-288, (2010); Bonoma T.V., Felder L.C., Nonverbal communication in marketing: Toward a communicational analysis, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 2, pp. 169-180, (1977); Brasel S.A., Gips J., Media multitasking: How visual cues affect switching behavior, Computers in Human Behavior, 77, 1, pp. 258-265, (2017); Bruce N.I., Murthi B.P.S., Rao R.C., A dynamic model for digital advertising: The effects of creative format, message content, and targeting on engagement, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 202-218, (2017); Cannon J.P., Homburg C., Buyer-supplier relationships and customer firm costs, Journal of Marketing, 65, 1, pp. 29-43, (2001); Castelo N., Schmitt B., Sarvary M., Thalmann N., Robot Or Human?

With the emergence of ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools, there is a dire need for a distinctive way of learning and application of learning to ensure learning effectiveness. Mere content is no longer the most important factor to learn these skills but. what is needed is the ability to retrieve material learnt, in the context of application. For the learner to be able to apply the critical thinking levels and higher learning levels of Blooms taxonomy, the basic first level of remembering forms the basic foundation, particularly when the students are from first generation educated families or with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. However, when students cram for the exams, they generally get an ‘illusion of learning’, where they think they know, but in reality often they may not be able to recall what they crammed when they need it later. This is a case of inefficient investment of time and effort in learning for the student. For the teacher, it slows down the teaching process and opportunity to engage in higher order thinking level applications. Addressing the frustrations of both teacher and students, the authors applied the concept of Retrieval method for MBA I year for Marketing Management course during a semester and a survey was conducted at the end of the semester to understand the perception of students on effectiveness of Retrieval techniques. The results supported that retrieval techniques were effective in supporting the student learning. © 2023 JEET.","Blooms Taxonomy; Learning intervention; Retention technique; Retrieval Technique","","","","","","","","Agarwal P.

Design/methodology/approach: Each of the three the three steps in the value creation cycle is examined, and the tools and approaches that leading companies use to maximize shareholder wealth are outlined. Findings: A customer-value based approach to management can help companies instill a fact-based decision-making process in the enterprise. This promotes faster growth through differentiated customer investment. It ensures that the highest return initiatives are prioritized. Enterprises using this disciplined three-step approach will be well positioned to better understand value potential, creating value, delivering value, and managing their market position to maximize the value they capture. Originality/value: Mastering the value cycle enables enterprises to win in both the customer markets and the financial markets. In short, it leads them to long-term profitable growth. Take the example of a commercial printer which had traditionally played in the procure and produce step of the print value chain associated with retail inserts. Retail inserts are one of the primary demand generation vehicles for retailers, who use these to drive store traffic. One retailer saw their store traffic drop by 20 percent over a one-month period after they decided to stop printing inserts. In this value chain print was fast becoming a commodity and, like its competitors, the company was looking for growth strategy amidst declining margins. An analysis of the value chain (see Table AI) revealed that while the print component of the value chain was fast being commoditized, value was pooling at the front of the value chain with the players who delivered the insert to the end customers. The pain experienced by the retailers was so high that they committed to co-developing a solution that would introduce a discontinuity in the value chain and redirect the pooling of value back to other participants of the value chain. The printer managed to escape the commodity trap and position itself towards profitable growth. Ashish Kothari is a Principal with Charter Consulting.

Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework is successful, with higher accuracies and good performance. Results revealed that customer service & marketing tactics are essential for a Company’ success & survival. Also, the C4.5 has accomplished better achievement than the SVM, RF, LR, NB, & ID3. At the end, CIoT Platform was evaluated by response time, request rate & processing of bank data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Analysis; Artificial intelligence (AI); CIoT; Data of bank; Marketing; SDM","Cloud analytics; Commerce; Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Marketing; Support vector machines; Analyse; Artificial intelligence; Cloud internet of thing; Data of bank; Logistics regressions; Marketing information; Naive bayes; Performance; Smart data mining; SMART datum; Internet of things","","","","","","","Bai Y., Zhao M., Li R., Xin P., A new data mining method for time series in visual analysis of regional economy, Information Processing & Management, 59, 1, (2022); Huang M.H., Rust R.T., A strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 49, 1, pp. 30-50, (2021); Li W., Big Data Precision Marketing Approach under IoT Cloud Platform Information Mining, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022); Elsalamony H.A., Bank direct marketing analysis of data mining techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 85, 7, pp. 12-22, (2014); Lai M., Smart financial management system based on data ming and man-machine management, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2022, (2022); Elsalamony H.A., Elsayad A.M., Bank direct marketing based on neural network and C5. 0 Models, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology (IJEAT), 2, 6, (2013); Kim S., Suh Y., Lee H., What IoT devices and applications should be connected?

Smith School of Business of University of Maryland, College Park, United States; Sun B., Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business Americas, New York, United States","Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

It demonstrates the application of appreciative inquiry (AI) as an underutilised research method in marketing investigations. Design/methodology/approach – An AI research approach was undertaken in a firm that had not started exporting at the commencement of the study whereby the interventionist approach allowed the management team to overcome negative perceptions in their decision-making. From a research perspective, marketing decision-making could be understood in real time as opposed to in hindsight. Findings – While the key decision-maker is likely to be the owner/manager in small newly internationalising firms, a variety of factors will affect the decision to start exporting including the influence of the management team. In particular, the management team’s perceptions towards a combination of effectuation- and causation-based decision-making where risk/reward considerations in exploiting various international marketing opportunities are undertaken in light of perceived affordable losses, as well as against evolving objectives. Originality/value – The contribution is to demonstrate the AI methodology, which to date has received attention in management domains other than marketing; it offers an interventionist approach to help managers overcome barriers and move positively forward in decision-making. It offers researchers an opportunity to understand marketing decision-making in real time. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Appreciative inquiry; Export; Internationalisation; Marketing","","","","","","","","Aaby N.-E., Slater S.F., Management influences on export performance: a review of the empirical literature 1978-88, International Marketing Review, 6, 4, pp. 7-26, (1989); Acedo F.J., Galan J.L., Export stimuli revisited: the influence of the characteristics of managerial decision makers on international behaviour, International Small Business Journal, 29, 6, pp. 648-670, (2011); Andersen O., On the internationalisation process of firms: a critical analysis, Journal of International Business Studies, 24, 2, pp. 209-231, (1993); Andersson S., International entrepreneurship, born globals and the theory of effectuation, Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 18, 3, pp. 627-643, (2011); Andersson S., Floren H., Differences in managerial behaviour between small international and non-international firms, Journal of International Entrepreneurship, 9, 3, pp. 233-258, (2011); Autio E., Sapienza H., Almeida J., Effect of age at entry, knowledge intensity, and imitability on international growth, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 5, pp. 909-924, (2000); Barney J.B., Is the resource-based ‘view’ a useful perspective for strategic management research?

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation","","","","","","","","Abijith A., Wamba S.F., Business value of RFID-enabled healthcare transformation projects, Business Process Management Journal, 19, 1, (2012); Barney J., Wright M., Ketchen D.J., The resource-based view of the firm: ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Benko A., Lanyi C.S., History of artificial intelligence, Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 1759-1762, (2009); Benner M.J., Dynamic or static capabilities?

Based on a comprehensive literature review, the combined strategies were used to develop a novel decision-making framework. The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making. The use of a novel three-phase decision-making framework which uses AI processes improves operational efficiency, increases insights and enhances the decision accuracy of complex problems at the strategic level in industries such as manufacturing. It could help operations executives to apply effective decisions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Understanding consumers’ approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies’ choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media. Findings: Trust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most. Research limitations/implications: The introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars. Practical implications: For businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on “who should certify AI” from a consumer perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first to introduce the topic of AI certification to the marketing/social media literature, provide a novel guideline to scholars and offer the first set of empirical studies examining consumer approval of AI certifications. © 2023, Myrthe Blösser and Andrea Weihrauch.","AI certification; AI regulation; Artificial intelligence; Consumer trust; Fair AI","","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (KIVI.2019.006); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

Heuristics play a role for the integration of human decision-making models and automation in augmentation processes, particularly in marketing where automation is widespread. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes qualitative data about the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics in decision-making models, and it is based on evidence collected from interviews with twenty-two experienced marketers. Findings: Marketers make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks. While the adoption of new automatic marketing tools modify the task environment and field of use of traditional decision-making models, the adoption of heuristics rules with a different scope is essential to defining inputs, interpreting/evaluating outputs and control the marketing automation system. Originality/value: The paper makes a contribution to research on the relationship between marketing automation and decision-making models. In particular, it proposes the results of in-depth interviews with senior decision makers to assess the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics as decision-making models adopted by marketers. © 2023, Simone Guercini.","AI in marketing;

The artificial intelligence (AI) information based PIPS was run two ways - selection with biased subjectivity (similar to current best value processes) and without biased subjectivity. Unlike other best value processes, PIPS minimizes the decision-making and subjective bias of the owner's representatives. The procurement test at Bridgerland ATC provides a comparison between the AI selection versus the user agency's subjective prioritization. The result of the system was one of the ""best"" construction projects procured at the state of Utah (on time, on budget, high quality), with no contractor generated change orders for additional cost, minimized construction management requirements, and high customer satisfaction.","Artificial intelligence; Construction; Cost control; Project management; Utah","Artificial intelligence; Contracts; Costs; Decision making; Marketing; Project management; Purchasing; Risk management; Standards; Cost control; Information measurement theory (IMT); Litigation; Utah; Construction industry","","","","","","","Kashiwagi D.T., State of Hawaii selects 'best value' by artificial intelligence, J.
