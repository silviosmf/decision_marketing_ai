Research on prescriptive analytics recommends uplift models to guide targeting decisions. Uplift models predict how much a marketing action will change customers' behavior, known as the individual treatment effect (ITE). Marketers can then solicit customers in decreasing order of their estimated ITE. We argue that the ITE-based targeting policy is not fully consistent with a business value maximization objective. We propose business-centric evaluation metrics that integrate estimates of the ITE and the expected business value and validate their benefits relative to the ITE-based targeting baseline using real-world marketing data. The new metrics yield remarkably higher profit across different uplift models, targeting depths, profit functions, and data sets. They further contribute to the growing field of interpretable data science by uncovering interdependencies between covariates, ITE, and profit and by clarifying whether customers are worth targeting because of high responsiveness or high value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Evaluation metric; Interpretable data science; Target marketing; Uplift modeling","Data Science; Profitability; Sales; Business value; Business-centric; Covariates; Evaluation metrics; Profit function; Targeted marketing; Treatment effects; Value driven; Commerce","","","","","","","Ascarza E., Retention futility: targeting high risk customers might be ineffective, J.

The results of automatic learning (linear regression) with 50 %, 60 %, 70 % and 80 % of training indicate that APESP favors the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills in the educational process on the probability of events and intersection. Data science (decision tree technique) allows identifying and establishing different predictive models on the use of APESP in the teaching-learning process. Likewise, Bayes' theorem predicts the impact of APESP (contents) on the educational process of probability.

However, despite these advances, relevant evidence on the measures to improve the management of Data Sciences in digital marketing remains scarce. To bridge this gap in the literature, the present study aims to review (i) methods of analysis, (ii) uses, and (iii) performance metrics based on Data Sciences as used in digital marketing techniques and strategies. To this end, a comprehensive literature review of major scientific contributions made so far in this research area is undertaken. The results present a holistic overview of the main applications of Data Sciences to digital marketing and generate insights related to the creation of innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery techniques. Important theoretical implications are discussed, and a list of topics is offered for further research in this field. The review concludes with formulating recommendations on the development of digital marketing strategies for businesses, marketers, and non-technical researchers and with an outline of directions of further research on innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery applications. © 2020 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","Data Mining;

Such a situation is no use to data scientists and certainly no use to the marketing team. The root of the issue is that two worlds meet here that speak completely different languages. Only if data scientists can ‘translate’ their results into marketing language will their work be successful. Marketing teams do not need as much information as possible; rather, they require just the right information, preferably with recommendations for action that can guide their decisions. To select the information that is truly useful for marketing and communicate it in an understandable way, data scientists must have more than expertise in analytics methods and tools (which is assumed and therefore not discussed in detail here); they also need to know about marketing objectives and have a comprehensive contextual understanding of their company’s industry and sector, including competitors. Knowledge of the general situation in the world as well as the legal, political and religious particularities of the countries in which the company operates is also required. In short, analytics results that truly drive marketing can only be delivered by data scientists with domain knowledge. Using a case study from the field, this paper shows how data scientists can gain the domain knowledge they need to be successful in marketing and in which aspects of their work it helps them perform more effectively. © Henry Stewart Publications.","computer science; data scientist; domain knowledge in data science; marketing analytics; predictive modelling; statistics; success factors","","","","","","","","Omale G., Marketing Data and Analytics Survey 2020: Marketing Analytics Fails to Meet Leadership Expectations, Gartner, (2020); The State of Marketing Budgets 2021; Marketing Data and Analytics Survey 2020; Adam A., Marketing Analytics: The End of an Era?, The Marketing Society, (2020); What is Domain Knowledge (Data Science)?; Palmer S., Data Science for the C-Suite, (2015); Rossbach P., The Need for Domain Knowledge in Data Science Programs, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, (2020); Based on Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A., Coleman S., Monetising Data – How to Uplift Your Business, (2018); Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A., Discussion of ‘Experiences with big data: Accounts form a data scientist’s perspective, Quality Engineering, (2020); Based on Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A., Colman S., Clarification of the Business Question behind the Problem, A Practical Guide to Data Mining for Business and Industry, (2014); Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A., Coleman S., A Practical Guide to Data Mining for Business and Industry, (2014); Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A., Coleman S., Monetising Data – How to Uplift Your Business, (2018); Blanchard T., The importance of domain knowledge – A healthcare data science perspective, Data Science Blog, (2017)","","","Henry Stewart Publications","","","","","","20547544","","","","English","Appl.

Applied in many domains, such as e-commerce, health, marketing, software development, and system design, personas have remained relatively unchanged for several decades. However, with the increasing popularity of digital user data and data science algorithms, there are new opportunities to progressively shift personas from general representations of user segments to precise interactive tools for decision-making. In this vision, the persona profile functions as an interface to a fully functional analytics system. With this research, we conceptually investigate how data-driven personas can be leveraged as analytics tools for understanding users. We present a conceptual framework consisting of (a) persona benefits, (b) analytics benefits, and (c) decision-making outcomes. We apply this framework for an analysis of digital marketing use cases to demonstrate how data-driven personas can be leveraged in practical situations. We then present a functional overview of an actual data-driven persona system that relies on the concept of data aggregation in which the fundamental question defines the unit of analysis for decision-making. The system provides several functionalities for stakeholders within organizations to address this question. © 2020 Bernard J.

The constant access to volume, variety, and veracity of data has made big data an integral part of management studies. New sub-management areas are emerging day by day with the support of big data to drive businesses. This study takes a systematic literature review approach to uncover the emerging management areas supported by big data in contemporary times. For this, we have analyzed the research papers published in the reputed management journals in the last ten years, fir using network analysis followed by natural language processing summarization techniques to find the emerging new management areas which are yet to get much attention. Furthermore, we ran the same exercise in each of these management areas to uncover these areas better. This research will act as a reference for future information systems (IS) scholars who want to perform analysis that is deep-dive in nature on each of these management areas, which in the coming times will get all the due attention to become dedicated research domains in the management area. We finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of future research in each of these management areas, which will be a true value addition for IS researchers. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data;

And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the ""winning model"" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the ""legwork"" of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e.g., the ""back-and-forth"" migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e.g., the inclusion of an ""off"" state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general ""recipe"" for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework). © 2014 INFORMS.","Business intelligence; Classification tree; Data science; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Hierarchical Bayesian methods; Machine learning; Model selection; Posterior predictive model checking; Random forest","","","","","","","","Bladt M., Neuts M.F., Matrix-exponential distributions: Calculus and interpretations via flows, Stochastic Models, 19, 1, pp. 113-124, (2003); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learn., 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Breiman L., Statistical modeling: The two cultures, Statist.

Channel splits have changed and online conversations have exploded. Marketing budgets have decreased as a percentage of revenue, meaning marketing funds must be used more effectively and efficiently than ever. Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers. This paper shows that with the right ‘business translator’ — that is, a person or team operating as the ‘glue’ between data science and business performance — sophisticated data science becomes accessible to commercial teams looking to drive performance improvements. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

Data science has influenced all business functions in an insurance organization to provide a distinct competitive advantage and push the industry towards the vision of ‘Insure Tech’. This case revolves around one such application of analytics in HDFC analytics dealing with championing the initiative for forecasting and analysis of Business Persistency. The persistency ratio is actually a fairly simple, yet very important metric that provides a snapshot of the health of the insurance industry. Considering the importance of this parameter, it became extremely important for HDFC Life to understand the factors behind persistency numbers and what lies ahead for the organization. The existing forecasting techniques were biased by the nature of work and did not give a significantly accurate and realistic number. The top management found this to be challenging for decision-making and decided that this required the intervention of the Business Insights department. Mr. Francis Rodrigues, SVP—Data Labs, Business Insights and Innovation was given the task to take over the pilot project and increase usage of analytical tools for Persistency Analysis. While Quarter 1 results have been significant, Mr. Francis Rodrigues still wonders whether he captured all the internal and external measures to obtain effective results. Has he done enough and how many more areas can analytics be applied for in the insurance domain? Research Question/Purpose: The current methods of persistency calculation are biased by the nature of work and deflect by a huge margin from the numbers actually achieved. There are no realistic forecasts for the coming year making the management uncertain with the decisions they take for strategic purposes. Theory: Time-indexed collection data help in predicting persistency numbers which are also influenced by some important variables behind collection follow-up and categories of customers. Type of the Case: Applied problem solving. Protagonist: Not needed. Options: Due to the availability of time-indexed data, time series was considered to be the best approach to forecast values into the future. However, that would only solve one half of the problem. It was also important to understand the parameters affecting persistency numbers, important variables behind persistency collections and classify the customers based on such variables. With this knowledge, classification models were also taken into consideration. Discussions and Case Questions: Besides time-indexed collection data which other variables amongst policy and demographic parameters influence persistency parameters? How can insights be drawn about the factors that are actually affecting the persistency numbers? Will calculating and sharing monthly persistency numbers for the coming year improve the percentage of customers remitting payment on time? By classifying customers into various categories with regards to the frequency of follow-up required for premium collection can a favourable segment be carved out? © 2020 SAGE Publications.","business insights; data analytics; financial analytics; Life insurance; marketing analytics; persistency; sales forecasting; time series analysis","","","","","","","","Anjani D., Benefits/advantages of QlikView, QlikSense, Tableau and Power BI, (2018); Box G.E., Time series analysis: Forecasting and control, (1970); Ivanovic M., Kurbalija V., Time series analysis and possible applications [Paper presentation], pp. 473-479, (2016); Keller L., Embracing Emotions in Life Insurance Part One: Create A New Model of Customer Engagement, (2018); Kulkarni J., Implementing 360-degree view of insurance customer – A practitioner’s perspective, Mindtree, (2018); Maurer T., The best life insurance companies 2020, Forbes, (2016); Pandey P., From ‘R vs Python’ to ‘R and Python’: Leveraging the best of both ‘Python and R’ in a single project, Towards Datascience, (2019); Shah A., The definitive guide for improving insurance persistency in India, (2018); Vyas M., What is the persistency ratio and why is it crucial to the health of the insurance sector?, Aegon life, (2018)","Y.

This case study combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit. We test the case study in a marketing analytics exam and discuss the performance of 134 students. Beyond assessing student performance in an exam, the case study facilitates teaching through in-class group work or assignments. Free of charge, under a liberal CC BY license, we encourage other educators to use the case study in their teaching.

The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analysis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attracting new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing investments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and business indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports. The research findings offer a scientific basis for making effective marketing decisions based on data, and the proposed MDSS can become part of an intelligent system for planning marketing activities. © Galyna Chornous, Yana Fareniuk, Vincentas Rolandas Giedraitis, Erstida Ulvidienė, Ganna Kharlamova, 2023.","decision-making; enterprise; intelligent agent; marketing mix; marketing strategy; modeling; multi-agent system","","","","","","","","Ai W.-G., Sun J., Li H., A distributed marketing decision support system based on multiintelligent-agent, Proceedings of 2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pp. 233-238, (2004); Alexouda G., A user-friendly marketing decision support system for the product line design using evolutionary algorithms, Decision Support Systems, 38, 4, pp. 495-509, (2005); Birn R., Stone M., Key issues in managing marketing research and customer insight, The Routledge companion to marketing research, pp. 219-243, (2021); Bulling N.
