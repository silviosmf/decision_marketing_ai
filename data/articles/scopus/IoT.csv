IoT system provides the decision-makers with new insights on the value proposition, value creation, helping them to strengthen their bond with the customers and adopt a more effective policy and practices. The food retailing scenario is becoming more complex and flexible putting pressure on the retailing firms to re-design their marketing strategies incorporating the changing consumer behavior. The IoT is expected to help the retailers in controlling the quality of food products, plan waste management of the items that have exceeded their shelf life, manage the temperature at the store, freezers and other equipment's contributing to the reduction of energy consumption. Despite the vast potential of IoT in food retail supply chains, the adoption of IoT is still in its nascent stage. Therefore, this study attempts to identify the various barriers that affect the adoption of IoT in the retail supply chain in the Indian context and also investigates the inter-dependences between the factors using a two-stage integrated ISM and DEMATEL methodology. Lack of government regulations and poor internet infrastructure were identified to be the significant drivers for IoT adoption. © 2019","DEMATEL; Internet of things; ISM; Multi-criteria decision-making technique; Retail supply chain","decision making; food consumption; food product; food quality; Internet; modeling; multicriteria analysis; retailing; supply chain management","","","","","","","Agarwal A., Shankar R., Tiwari M.K., Modeling agility of supply chain, Ind.

Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence (AI);

Design/methodology/approach: A survey strategy was used in this study to collect data from 225 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) respondents who were on the registered list of the Ghana Enterprise Agency in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Structural equation modeling – path analysis was used to estimate the impact of AIM on the performance of SMEs. Findings: The analyzed data shows that AIM has significant impact on the financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance in the case of SMEs in Ghana. This study establishes the significance of AIM approach in achieving financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance through the application of AIM determinants including, Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative decision-making systems (CDMS), virtual and augmented reality (VAR) and personalization. Research limitations/implications: Aside the aforementioned significance of this research study, this study has limitations. The sample size of this research study can be expanded to include SME respondents in other geographical areas that were not considered in this study. Future research studies should concentrate on how AIM can analyze customer communications and information such as posts on social media to develop future communications that may enhance customer engagement. Practical implications: The practical implications comprise of two key items. First, this research study encourages SME owners and managers to develop an AIM method as a fundamental strategic goal in their pursuit to improve SME performance. Second, SME owners and managers should increasingly implement the four determinants of AIM indicated in this research study (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) to develop essential resources for effective application of AIM to improve their performance. Originality/value: The results of this study provide a strong support to RBV theory and the proposition that AIM and its determinants (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) should be recognized as an essential strategic resource for improving the performance (i.e., financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance) of SMEs. This study also contributes to the current body of knowledge on AIM and management, particularly in the context of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence in marketing (AIM); Business organization performance; Emerging economy; SMEs","","","","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi K., The impact of innovative marketing on the performance of Ghanaian food processing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), (2020); Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Amer F., Hammoud S., Khatatbeh H., Lohner S., Boncz I., Endrei D., The deployment of balanced scorecard in health care organizations: is it beneficial?

The paper primarily aims to investigate the structure and dynamics of academic publications in English dealing with issues of IoT development – from a marketing perspective, using methods of systematic mapping, i.e., co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords in the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases. Analysis of research papers enables the identification of the most influential articles, papers, and journals, as well as visualization of the keywords and co-authorship co-occurrences. There has been an exponential increase in studies on IoT applications in marketing, indexed in Scopus and WoS citation databases. An insight into analyzed papers shows that companies utilize large amounts of data generated by the IoT to gain insights into customers’ supply and value creation, which helps strengthen their relationships with customers and pursue more efficient marketing policies and practices, ultimately leading to a competitive advantage. The IoT is expected to evolve into a vast network that includes smart devices and significantly influences people’s behavior, especially decision-making at different stages of the purchasing process. © 2024, University of Split - Faculty of Economics.

The paper adopts qualitative research, based on nine in-depth interviews with key informants, to capture senior executives' experiences with implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in their organisations. The research is focused on three manufacturing industries: the automotive, food and furniture industries. The research shows that depending on the stage of the value chain, different Industry 4.0 technologies are more suitable for the support of managers' decisions. Various Industry 4.0 technologies support decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain. In the Design stage, 3D printing and scanning technologies play a crucial role. In the case of Inbound Logistics, robotisation, automation, Big Data analysis, and Business Intelligence are most useful. During the Manufacturing stage, robotisation, automation, 3D printing, scanning, Business Intelligence, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine (M2M) integration enable quick decision-making and speed up production. Sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) optimise distribution in the Outbound Logistics stage. And finally, Business Intelligence supports decisions within the Sales and Marketing stage. It is also the most versatile technology among all particular stages. The paper provides empirical evidence on the Industry 4.0 technology support in decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain, which leads to more effective value chain management, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions at each value-chain stage. When using properly selected Industry 4.0 technologies, managers can optimise their production processes, reduce costs, avoid errors and improve customer satisfaction.

However, the attributes for enabling practice between such technological interfaces with managerial adoption are been lagging creating a knowledge gap. To address this, present research surveys the prior work from 1970 to 2020 on intelligent decision support models specific to banking. Subsequently, findings are synthesized on quadrant outcomes; technology; employees, customers, and organizations for service ecosystems. In addition, the managerial perceptions of technology on work are captured through short survey. Finally, scope of advancements like big data, internet of things (IoT), virtual reality (VR) along other untapped conceptual relationships into this framework are discussed. © 2021 The Authors","Banking; Bibliometrics; Decision support systems; Emerging markets; Systematic review","","","","","","","","Adapa S., Roy S.K., Consumers’ post-adoption behaviour towards Internet banking: Empirical evidence from Australia, Behaviour & Information Technology, 36, 9, pp. 970-983, (2017); Adikari A., Burnett D., Sedera D., de Silva D., Alahakoon D., Value co-creation for open innovation: An evidence-based study of the data driven paradigm of social media using machine learning, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 1, 2, (2021); Agrawal V., Seth N., Dixit J.K., A combined AHP–TOPSIS–DEMATEL approach for evaluating success factors of e-service quality: An experience from Indian banking industry, Electronic Commerce Research, pp. 1-33, (2020); Aladwani A.M., Online banking: A field study of drivers, development challenges, and expectations, International journal of information management, 21, 3, pp. 213-225, (2001); Alalwan A.A., Dwivedi Y.K., Rana N.P., Williams M.D., Consumer adoption of mobile banking in Jordan, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 29, 1, (2016); Ali O.G., Akcay Y., Sayman S., Yilmaz E., Ozcelik M.H., Cross-selling investment products with a win-win perspective in portfolio optimization, Operations Research, 65, 1, pp. 55-74, (2017); Anand S.S., Patrick A.R., Hughes J.G., Bell D.A., A data mining methodology for cross-sales, Knowledge-Based Systems, 10, 7, pp. 449-461, (1998); Arjun R., Suprabha K.R., Innovation and Challenges of Blockchain in Banking: A Scientometric View, International Journal of Interactive Multimedia & Artificial Intelligence, 6, 3, (2020); Azadeh A., Saberi M., Jiryaei Z., An intelligent decision support system for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel attributes in a large bank, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 16, pp. 12358-12370, (2012); Baabdullah A.M., Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Kizgin H., Patil P., Consumer use of mobile banking (M-Banking) in Saudi Arabia: Towards an integrated model, International Journal of Information Management, 44, pp. 38-52, (2019); Baabdullah A.M., Rana N.P., Alalwan A.A., Islam R., Patil P., Dwivedi Y.K., Consumer adoption of self-service technologies in the context of the Jordanian banking industry: Examining the moderating role of channel types, Information Systems Management, 36, 4, pp. 286-305, (2019); Bach M.P., Jukovic S., Dumicic K., Sarlija N., Business client segmentation in banking using self-organizing maps, South East European Journal of Economics and Business, 8, 2, pp. 32-41, (2014); Basias N., Themistocleous M., Morabito V., SOA adoption in e-banking, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 26, 6, pp. 719-739, (2013); Bitner M.J., Brown S.W., Meuter M.L., Technology infusion in service encounters, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 138-149, (2000); Bose R., Customer relationship management: Key components for I.T. success, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 102, 2, pp. 89-97, (2002); Broadbent M., Weill P., Improving business and information strategy alignment: Learning from the banking industry, IBM systems Journal, 32, 1, pp. 162-179, (1993); Cho J., Park I., Michel J.W., How does leadership affect information systems success?

This study will also look at the effect of using GIoT applications on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, which in turn, contributes to the sustainable green performance. Therefore, value-belief-norm theory (VBN) was chosen as the theoretical basis for this study's conceptual model. Two constructs derived from VBN (i.e. biospheric value and ecological worldview) are suggested as key predictors for the use of GIoT applications. The conceptual model is extended by considering the role of green marketing orientation (GMO); green energy awareness; and energy knowledge/technical capabilities. The current model also suggests that the utilization of GIoT applications would impact both energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Online questionnaires are used to gather data from a purposive sample (n = 500) of managers and employees at different levels in different service organizations. Statistical results show strong evidence demonstrating the significant effect of biospheric value; ecological worldview; green marketing orientation (GMO); and energy knowledge/technical capabilities with GIoT. This study presents a valuable contribution that helps researchers; policy-makers, and practitioners to identify and understand the most important antecedents and consequences of U-GIoT. It is also worth noting for future studies looking at different applications of pro-environmental behaviour such as sustainable practices, green mobility and transportation, paperless work; recycling; reducing waste levels; and smart green solar. Policy-makers, decision-makers, practitioners and specialists in green energy systems (i.e. GIoT) will be able to use this information for future improvement. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Green IoT; Green marketing orientation; Value-belief-norm theory","Biospherics; Commerce; Decision making; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Human resource management; Internet of things; Marketing; Sustainable development; Carbon footprint reductions; Conceptual model; Energy; Green energy; Green internets; Green IoT; Green marketing; Green marketing orientation; Technical capabilities; Value-belief-norm theory; Carbon footprint","","","","","","","Abrahamse W., Steg L., How do socio-demographic and psychological factors relate to households’ direct and indirect energy use and savings?, Journal of economic psychology, 30, 5, pp. 711-720, (2009); Ahmed K., Rehman M.U., Ozturk I., What drives carbon dioxide emissions in the long-run?

We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial-and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection. © 2021 by the authors.

Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market. © The Operational Research Society 2022.","action design research (ADR); business system; digital servitization; digital transformation; Internet of Things (IoT); resource-based view (RBV)","Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Industrial research; Information services; Internet of things; Manufacture; Metadata; Action design research; Business systems; Design research; Digital servitization; Digital transformation; Internet of thing; Research approach; Resource-based view; Servitization; Managers","","","","","MADE SPIR; Manufacturing Academy of Denmark, (3067-00001B); Strategic Platform for Innovation and Research; Innovationsfonden, IFD; Manufacturing Academy of Denmark, MADE","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the MADE SPIR (Manufacturing Academy of Denmark — Strategic Platform for Innovation and Research) [grant # 3067-00001B].

Thus, this study recommended that marketing intelligence be combined with internet of things (IoT) capabilities in order to gain a competitive advantage. The IoT is capable of perceiving the physical world, detecting and recording changes, and responding appropriately. Companies with strong IoT capabilities can restructure and adapt their marketing intelligence skills to stay competitive. Methodology: Using survey data from 258 respondents of retail organisations, structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the hypothesis. Findings: The results showed that IoT capability is positively linked to marketing intelligence. Originality: Empirically, it has been established that IoT capability is required for marketing intelligence in retail companies in Oman. The belief is that retailers should use the IoT to increase their marketing intelligence and so get a competitive advantage. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","capability; competitiveness; information technology;

It is important to service a broad class involving logistics, buyer, seller and end-users. During various phases of the sales, purchases and marketing process, IoT will influence decision-making. Electronic commerce is a new form of trade under the development of modern information technology. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the integrated neutrosophic framework based on the internet of things (INF-IoT) has been proposed to support marketers and companies to make a powerful marketing strategy using identified data from IoT devices. Findings: The experimental results show that the proposed method has high performance and very efficient. Originality/value: This approach may reduce business activity to its core components, which include, in the simplest case, a value proposal, distribution channels and customers, and explain how a network of multi-actors generates a product and services, distributes and uses the value in production. Furthermore, an efficient interface is provided by the logistic module to maintain an order list. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-commerce; Electronic market; Integrated framework; Internet of things; Logistics","article; electronic commerce; information technology; internet of things; marketing","","","","","","","Abdel-Basset M., Gunasekaran M., Mohamed M., Chilamkurti N., A framework for risk assessment, management and evaluation: Economic tool for quantifying risks in supply chain, Future Generation Computer Systems, 90, pp. 489-502, (2019); Abomhara M., Cyber security and the internet of things: vulnerabilities, threats, intruders and attacks, Journal of Cyber Security and Mobility, 4, 1, pp. 65-88, (2015); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Big data analytics in E-commerce: a systematic review and agenda for future research, Electronic Markets, 26, 2, pp. 173-194, (2016); Alaa M., Zaidan A.A., Zaidan B.B., Talal M., Kiah M.L.M., A review of smart home applications based on internet of things, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 97, pp. 48-65, (2017); Al-Momani A.M., Mahmoud M.A., Ahmad M.S., Modeling the adoption of internet of things services: a conceptual framework, International Journal of Applied Research, 2, 5, pp. 361-367, (2016); Dhote S., Vichoray C., Pais R., Baskar S., Shakeel P.M., Hybrid geometric sampling and AdaBoost based deep learning approach for data imbalance in E-commerce, Electronic Commerce Research, 20, 2, (2019); Guo P., Han M., Cao N., Shen Y., The research on innovative application of E-commerce in IoT era, 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC), 2, pp. 410-413, (2017); Hsieh M.Y., Interdisciplinarily exploring the most potential IoT technology determinants in the omnichannel E-commerce purchasing Decision-Making processes, Applied Sciences, 10, 2, (2020); Khanna A., Kaur S., Evolution of internet of things (IoT) and its significant impact in the field of precision agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 157, pp. 218-231, (2019); Khrais L.T., Azizi T.A., Analyzing consumer attitude toward mobile payment technology and its role in booming the E-commerce business, Journal of Talent Development and Excellence, 12, 3, pp. 1069-1076, (2020); Kshetri N., The evolution of the internet of things industry and market in China: an interplay of institutions, demands and supply, Telecommunications Policy, 41, 1, pp. 49-67, (2017); Mahdavinejad M.S., Rezvan M., Barekatain M., Adibi P., Barnaghi P., Sheth A.P., Machine learning for internet of things data analysis: a survey, Digital Communications and Networks, 4, 3, pp. 161-175, (2018); Maple C., Security and privacy in the internet of things, Journal of Cyber Policy, 2, 2, pp. 155-184, (2017); Mishra S., Rastogi C., Future of E-commerce in India, Studies in Indian Place Names, 40, 69, pp. 345-351, (2020); Ng I.C., Wakenshaw S.Y., The internet-of-Things: Review and research directions, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 34, 1, pp. 3-21, (2017); Ramasamy P., Ranganathan V., Palanisamy V., Kadry S., Securing one-time password generation using elliptic-curve cryptography with self-portrait photograph for mobile commerce application, Multimedia Tools and Applications, pp. 1-19, (2019); Ray P.P., A survey on internet of things architectures, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 30, 3, pp. 291-319, (2018); Ruan D.X., Wu D., Wu X.B., The internet of things technology in logistics application: Stages, trend and drive modes, 2012 International Symposium on Management of Technology (ISMOT), pp. 452-455, (2012); Turban E., Whiteside J., King D., Outland J., Mobile commerce and the internet of things, Introduction to Electronic Commerce and Social Commerce, pp. 167-199, (2017); Warkentin M., Orgeron C., Using the security triad to assess blockchain technology in public sector applications, International Journal of Information Management, 52, (2020)","T.

The results of the literature review are then used to offer innovative solutions for the distribution needs of a new sales channel of a major soft drink multinational enterprise in Ecuador, Latin America. The objectives of this study are achieved through the use of two methodologies: The Literature Review Methodology for Scientific and Information Management, through its structuring and systematization; and the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodology, with the integration of marketing and market segmentation concepts for the determination of an existing local opportunity. The literature review shows that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) uses technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and Big Data to analyze, control and manage data that allows an efficient flow of information for decision-making purposes. ICT enables smart cities and smart factories to develop flexibility and quick adaptation to market changes, as well as to generate green logistic practices that comply with environmental regulations. Regarding the case study, the present study starts by analyzing the market needs for the implementation of the sales channel ""At Work"" for a multinational company dedicated to the production and distribution of soft drinks. Finally, the study presents innovative alternatives for distribution, focused on the results of the literature review, in order to optimize the delivery of soft drinks to the final customer of the ""At Work"" sales channel. © 2020, Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft fur Technische Logistik.

However, DSP platforms often need help with two issues during the auction process: low enthusiasm and unreasonable bidding. To address these problems, we use the second-price sealed auction and propose a framework for multi-round real-time bidding with game machine learning. We introduce a multi-round advertising bidding mechanism incorporating reputation incentive rules to enhance DSP enthusiasm. The aim is to stimulate DSP participation and deter malicious DSP behavior, ensuring fairness and transparency in the bidding process. Subsequently, we design an auction screening model and adopt a multi-round auction format to ensure that only capable and willing advertising demand partners can participate, thus guaranteeing the reasonableness of DSP bids. Furthermore, we design a real-time bidding mechanism to adapt to the dynamic nature of the IoT marketing market. This mechanism transforms the problem of maximizing DSP revenue under budget constraints into a parameter adjustment problem based on a Markov Decision Process. We then utilize the Double Deep Q Network method to obtain the optimal bidding strategy for DSPs. Ultimately, the results demonstrate that our framework improves the final transaction price by 14.71%, increases the expected click-through rate by an average of 19.35%, and reduces the average cost per thousand impressions by 20.34%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deep reinforcement learning; IoT marketing; Multi-round auctions; Real-time bidding","","","","","","Startup Research Foundation for Distinguished Scholars, China, (202112016); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61872205, 62172377); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2019MF018)","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant numbers 62172377 , 61872205 ], the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [grant number ZR2019MF018 ], and the Startup Research Foundation for Distinguished Scholars, China [grant numbers 202112016 ].","Nguyen D.C., Ding M., Pathirana P.N., Seneviratne A., Li J., Poor H.V., Federated learning for internet of things: A comprehensive survey, IEEE Commun.

Nevertheless, this is rather a marketing term that unites a number of technological (and other) areas: Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), communication networks. The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research. The results of the study can be used in further theoretical and applied research, in the formation of government policy in research and development, as well as in decision-making in the field of urban management. © 2019, Geographical Institute ""Jovan Cviji"" of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

A review of big data usage in retail stores was conducted along with a document-based descriptive analysis of secondary data and further critical literature analysis. Decision making strategies and flow charts were used for the development of competitiveness methodology by referring to a case of a supermarket chain. Customer segmentation researchers analyse mainly the algorithms or behaviour pattern behind the clustering process; however, neither of them offers a proper strategy for implementing a realtime customer segmentation process inside the enterprise. Sustainable competitiveness advantage may be achieved by implementing the segmentation theory with concepts of data mining and internet of things (Iot). The process of developed data mining shows many ways for the enterprise to maximize competitiveness. However, time and large investments may be required to develop proper methods for unique solutions. A concrete case study of the selected retail store should be analysed before implementing the real-time customer segmentation methodology inside the enterprise. There is a multicultural population in every market that has different culture, beliefs, preferences and shopping patterns; therefore, constant analysis is essential for efficient usage of customer segmentation. Practically none of the prior research results carried out by other authors offered a concrete methodology how to implement real-time customer's segmentation inside the enterprise. The authors created such a methodology that can provide sustainable long-term competitiveness advantage.","Big data concept; Competitiveness; Customer segmentation; Marketing; Retail sales","","","","","","","","Brito P.Q., Soaresb C., Almeidab S., Montea A., Byvoetc M., Customer segmentation in a large database of an online customized fashion business, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 36, 1, pp. 93-100, (2015);

Databases about consumer preferences and market situation are at the disposal of major international corporations, which makes it difficult for advertisers and admen. It is envisaged that the development of technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 6G cellular communication should change the situation in the field of processing and using information for accounting, management and marketing purposes. The purpose of the scientific research lies in optimization of accounting and international marketing in terms of determining income, expenses and, accordingly, profits from the lease of commercial and advertising space in all international participants of lease relations on the basis of information generated by innovative technologies of the Internet of Things and cellular communication of the sixth communication generation. In particular, the method of using technologies of the Internet of Things and 6G cellular networks was developed for obtaining information about the movement of visitors of commercial establishments and their consumer preferences. The procedure for recognition and accounting of all market participants’ income, expenses and, accordingly, financial results from the lease of commercial and advertising space has been developed, including operators of commercial establishments, advertisers, admen, and leasers. The organization of accounting the lease of commercial and advertising areas as part of international economic activity of enterprises has been optimized by providing international access to information and software and technical resources of the Internet of Things and cellular communication. Management decisions have been made as a reaction to information from a database about visiting commercial establishments. Based on the authors’ proposals, the order of circulation of accounting and management information and funds from buyers to operators of trade networks, trade establishments, advertising agencies and, finally, producers of goods (works, services) are proposed through the systems of international information relations that form a closed cycle of economic activity at the global level and require further scientific research. © 2023 The Author(s).","6G cellular communication; accounting; commercial and advertising areas; international economic activity; international marketing; lease profit; the Internet of Things","","","","","","","","Muravskyi V., Zadorozhnyi Z.-M., Lytvynenko V., Yurchenko O., Koshchynets M., Comprehensive use of 6G cellular technology accounting activity costs and cyber security, Independent Journal of Management & Production (Special Edition ISE, S&P), 13, 3, pp. 107-122, (2022); Lu Yang, Security in 6G: The Prospects and the Relevant Technologies, Journal of Industrial Integration and Management, 5, pp. 271-289, (2020); Popovski P., Chiariotti F., Huang K., Kalor A., Kountouris M., Pappas N., Soret B., A Perspective on Time towards Wireless 6G, 22nd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT), 110, 8, pp. 1116-1146, (2021); Zhang J., Wang Z., Wang D., Zhang X., Gupta B B., Liu X., Ma J., A Secure Decentralized Spatial Crowdsourcing Scheme for 6G-Enabled Network in Box, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, pp. 1-11, (2021); Bourbah A., Meliani B., Zhour M., Zouine Y., The Next-Generation 6G: Trends, Applications, Technologies, Challenges, and Use Cases, Proceedings of Seventh International Congress on Information and Communication Technology, pp. 761-770, (2023); Khan A., Hassan UL, Naveed Y., Zhao J., Niyato D., Zhang Y., Poor H.

However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs)","","","","","","","","Sofla M.S., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Mirzaee R.F., Towards Effective Offloading Mechanisms in Fog Computing, Multimed.

IoT enables physical devices to connect and exchange data through the Internet by collecting strategic information, thus creating opportunities for companies to become more efficient and responsive to market changes. This paper thus investigates how companies are blending IoT solutions into their relationship marketing strategies and focuses on finding how this combination can boost business performance and what the challenges are when dealing with disruptive technology changes. To explore the subject's detailed information and to get a better understanding of managerial decisions concerning IoT, this research conducts in-depth case design analysis from a company's point of view. The data presented herein come from two main sources: open-ended interviews and direct observations, with the interviewees holding high managerial positions in Taiwan's IoT industry. This study aims to contribute to the literature by bringing awareness to the importance of closely following technological trends in combination with relationship marketing strategies and how they help firms remain competitive and profitable. The results of this empirical research shed light on the importance of understanding the impacts of IoT solutions on businesses, especially on clients' behaviors and the development of targeted strategies. The cases herein present similarities on the awareness of the speed of disruptive technologies like IoT, the importance of developing new solutions aligned with new technologies, their impact at creating new business solutions, and their contribution to the development of firm strategies. The findings also show that the application of innovative IoT solutions positively affects the process of developing long and successful relationships through relationship marketing actions. Conversely, concerns related to data security vary according to business segments and relationship marketing pillars such as trust, commitment, and reliability, which could help reduce feelings of ambiguity. This research contributes to filling the gap in the literature by offering a deeper understanding of the correlation between IoT and relationship marketing. Moreover, we illustrate how a combination of these two factors can contribute to the development of stronger marketing strategies, as well as their implications on business. The results of this research suggest further and more comprehensive investigations are needed in the future in order to explore the topic in greater depth and to see how the speed of technology is evolving. © 2018","E-commerce; In-depth case study; Innovation; Internet-of-Things; IoT; Relationship Marketing","Taiwan; Blending; Commerce; Electronic commerce; Managers; Marketing; Strategic planning; Business performance; Direct observations; Disruptive technology; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Managerial decision; Relationship marketing; Technological trends; competitiveness; electronic commerce; innovation; Internet; marketing; technological change; Internet of things","","","","","","","Anderson E.W., Fornell C., Lehmann D.R., Customer satisfaction, market share, and profitability: findings from Sweden, J.
