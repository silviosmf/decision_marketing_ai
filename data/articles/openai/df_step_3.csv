"This study uses a Logit model to examine the probability of the image of the tourism destination Madeira, a Portuguese autonomous insular region, being strengthened after the tourists's visit to the destination. The results of the empirical study are based on a survey carried out to tourists during their visit to the island of Madeira, between March and July 2008. The model confirms that the probability of enhancing Madeira's tourism destination image after the visit is explained by several independent variables, gathered from the literature review. The findings of the study intend to call local authorities's attention to the importance of repeated tourists due to the impact that their enhanced image of Madeira may have on the economic sustainability of the destination and on the potential savings in promotion investment. This happens because the client's loyalty brings a high return of the destination's marketing investment. The conclusions can also help the decision makers of the tourism sector of the island of Madeira to better plan their destination marketing activities.",Machado L.P.; Santos C.M.; Sarmento M.,Strategic,,Destination image; Loyalty; Satisfaction; Service quality; Sustainability,5.0,,5,0,Varna University of Management,"The study focuses on the long-term implications of enhancing the tourism destination image of Madeira, which relates to strategic planning and decision-making for local authorities and tourism sector stakeholders.",scopus-autonomous,70,20,Madeira Island - Destination image and tourists loyalty,2009
"Opinion dynamics investigate the spreading and evolution of opinions among a set of individuals. This is especially relevant in decision-making — the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options —, that is commonly based on personal opinions which may evolve along time. In this work, we present a model of opinion dynamics where opinions are represented using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples, a realistic representation of imprecise information. In our framework, the propagation of opinions in the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes. Additionally, we use a social network to represent agents’ interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). Our opinion dynamics model can be easily integrated into an agent-based system to how opinions spread and evolve. Experimental results show the impact of the communication processes, the social network topology, the awareness deactivation mechanism, and the agents’ influence on the opinion dynamics of others. Furthermore, we present two case studies of our opinion dynamics model applied to marketing and politics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Giráldez-Cru J.; Chica M.; Cordón O.,Tactical,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107559,Agent-based models; Fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples; Opinion dynamics; Social networks,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract presents a model of opinion dynamics that can be applied to specific domains such as marketing and politics, indicating a structured approach to decision-making based on evolving opinions.

"Product seeding, defined as the act by which firms send products to selected customers and encourage them to spread word of mouth, is a critical decision support strategy for the success of new products. Using multiple agent-based simulation techniques, we investigated the relative importance of three widely adopted seeding strategies (seeding influentials, early adopters, and random targets) in a competitive market in which products are vertically differentiated in terms of quality and brand strength. We found robust evidence that the finding of an optimal seeding strategy depends on consumers' propensity to spread negative WOM. When negative WOM propensity is low, seeding influentials outperform seeding early adopters or random targets. When negative WOM propensity is high, decision-making about an optimal seeding strategy relies on the relative quality and brand strength of the product and the focal firm's objective. In particular, if a product's relative quality is low, seeding early adopters is the optimal seeding strategy in terms of both market share (MS) and net present value (NPV); if the product's relative quality is equal, seeding early adopters is most effective for increasing MS, while seeding influentials is the best for increasing NPV; and if the product's relative quality is high, seeding influentials is the optimal strategy, except that for products with strong brand strength and firm aims at maximizing the MS growth. We conclude the paper by discussing its theoretical contributions and managerial relevance for decision support. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Cui F.; Wang L.; Luo X.R.; Cui X.,Strategic,10.1016/j.dss.2024.114263,Agent-based modeling; Market competition; New product marketing; Product seeding; Word-of-mouth,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses decision support strategies for product seeding, focusing on long-term implications and outcomes in competitive markets.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and related rise of public distrust has called personal autonomy in health messaging into question, drawing attention to two competing forms of health messaging—communicating to persuade versus to inform. Communicating to persuade utilizes marketing techniques to promote behavior change whereas communicating to inform focuses on providing information to facilitate informed decision-making. Communicating to inform is supported by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that autonomy, coupled with competence and relatedness, is a basic psychological need, relevant to making health-decisions and maintaining behavior change. This study aims to assess the above mentioned dynamics of SDT in health messaging through the development of an autonomous scale and assessment criteria. The purpose of the scale is to guide the development of health messaging that aims to communicate to inform (autonomy-enhancing) rather than communicating to persuade or coerce the audience into adopting a specific health behavior (autonomy-diminishing). The results of the study suggest that individual perception of autonomy in health messaging is influenced by a variety of factors. As such, the criteria outlined in this scale can be used as a guide to develop health messaging that purposefully integrates and supports autonomy-enhancing principles.

"Purpose: Retail industry currently in Indonesia is less profitable. However, there is still a retail stores chain group that Matahari endures and this is absolutely not autonomous purchasing by the customers. The objective of the study is to identify the qualities of stores and to assess their impacts on the consumer purchasing decision. This is most significant for sellers in today’s unstable market and is worried about sellers’ essential to take into account the effect of selling store image and its relation to purchaser reliability. Methodology: The used method in the research is casual research method. Data is analysing through descriptive analysis method and multiple linear regression. The data is processed through SPSS software. Main Findings: Based on interviews conducted by respondents, one of the store brands in Matahari’s department store is the Executive, which is a store brand that sells clothes, and trousers with expensive price, so if the customer uses the brand product Executive, they will feel proud. Because the customer has a good view of the product of the Executive brand, and the Executive product is sold in Matahari department store, the customer’s assessment of the department store of the Matahari becomes good. Implications/Applications: The results of the research can be used by Matahari department store in developing their marketing strategies in order to promote brand image. © Yudhya.",Yudhya T.B.,Tactical,10.18510/hssr.2019.7513,Consumer purchasing; Indonesia; Market; Matahari; Profitable; Retail; Store attributes; Store image,5.0,,15,0,Gyandhara International Academic Publications,"The study focuses on identifying store qualities and their impact on consumer purchasing decisions, which suggests a structured approach to achieving strategic goals through targeted marketing strategies and brand image enhancement.",scopus-autonomous,10,70,Retail store image: A study of the matahari department store (at Bandung Indonesia),2019
"This article reviews the difficulties facing national courts in respect of the regulation of online gambling activity in the wake of two recent decisions of the European Court of Justice that, in mixed messages, may be moving towards liberalization of the European gaming market. More than a year after the Gambelli and Lindman decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the first report of the European Commission on the application of the electronic commerce Directive, the impact of these recent European (r)evolutions for the gaming industry has not always been very clear. In the Netherlands and Belgium, existing jurisprudence was confirmed in the so-called post-Gambelli decisions. In Germany, where most of the competences to regulate gaming activities have been attributed to the autonomous Länder, some courts have recognized that, in the absence of a consistent gaming policy, the imposed restrictions on the cross-border provision of gaming services could not be justified by the imperative reasons of public order. In Spain, the Loterías y Apuestas del Estado (LAE) is maintaining its position that it has the exclusive right to offer and promote games on the Internet. In Italy, a regional court has had to refer a gaming case to European Court of Justice (ECJ). The conclusion of one year post-Gambelli case-law is that the Gambelli and Lindman requirements are applied in a very diverging manner. In the Dutch Betfair appeal case, it was even insinuated that Gambelli was not relevant! Before commenting on these national decisions, the Gambelli and Lindman decisions will be reviewed again. © 2005 Ewout Keuleers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt a three-stage cloud-based management system for optimizing greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and marketing decisions with supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain with multiple suppliers, one single manufacturer and multiple retailers. Design/methodology/approach: The manufacturer purchases optional components of a certain functionality from his alternative suppliers and customizes a set of platform products for retailers in different independent market segments. To tackle the studied problem, a hierarchical analytical target cascading (ATC) model is proposed, Jaya algorithm is applied and supplier selection and product family design are implemented in its encoding procedure. Findings: A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the ATC model in solving the optimization problem and the corresponding algorithm. It has shown that the ATC model can not only obtain close optimization results as a central optimization method but also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. Originality/value: This paper first develops a three-stage cloud-based management system to optimize GHG emission, marketing decisions, supplier selection and product family design in a multi-level supply chain. Then, the ATC model is proposed to obtain the close optimization results as central optimization method and also maintain the autonomous decision rights of different supply chain members. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Huang Y.; Gao K.; Wang K.; Lv H.; Gao F.,Strategic,10.1108/IMDS-06-2021-0402,Analytical target cascading; Cloud technology; Greenhouse gas; Jaya; Product family design; Supplier selection,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract describes a framework for optimizing greenhouse gas emissions and marketing decisions within a multi-level supply chain, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and planning.

"In an effort to understand how different types of food cues in food ads are automatically encouraging unhealthy eating behaviors, the current study examined how the presence of actual food consumption behaviors (use cues) and presence of multiple individuals indorsing food products (social cues) in fast food ads would influence individual attentional and behavioral responses. A use cue (2) x social cue (2) x repetition (3) fully within-subjects factorial design experiment with young adults (N = 164) was conducted. Findings demonstrated that participants paid greater attention to the fast food ads which contained multiple people (group cue) eating the advertised food products (use cue) when compared to other types of fast food ads. In addition, participants also self-reported greater social support and purchase intention when seeing use and group cues in ads. Understanding how these cues function in food advertising to encourage unhealthy eating may help health practitioners and individuals create more helpful intervention strategies. Further, applying these marketing tactics to ads for food products that are healthier (i.e., less energy dense and more nutrient dense) may help to maximize healthy food palatability, thereby increasing motivation for viewers to make autonomous decisions about eating healthier. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Liu J.; Bailey R.L.,Tactical,10.1080/10410236.2019.1654174,,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study explores how specific cues in fast food advertisements influence consumer behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing to optimize ad strategies and improve engagement.

"Currently, the European Union (EU) is focusing on a large-scale campaign dedicated to developing a competitive circular economy and expanding the single digital market. One of the main goals of this campaign is the implementation of the sustainability principles in the development and deployment cycle of the new generation technologies. This paper focuses on the fast-growing field of autonomous mobile robots and the harsh environment exploration problem. Currently, most state-of-the-art navigation methods are utilising the idea of evaluating candidate observation locations by combining different task-related criteria. However, these map building solutions are often designed for operating in near-perfect environments, neglecting such factors as the danger to the robot. In this paper, a new strategy that aims to address the safety and re-usability of the autonomous mobile agent by implementing the economic sustainability principles is proposed. A novel multi-criteria decision-making method ofWeighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment-Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets, namely WASPAS-SVNS, and the weight selection method of Step-Wise Weights Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) are applied to model a dynamic decision-making system. The experimental evaluation of the proposed strategy shows that increased survivability of the autonomous agent can be observed. Compared to the greedy baseline strategy, the proposed method forms the movement path which orients the autonomous agent away from dangerous obstacles. © 2019 by the authors.",Bausys R.; Cavallaro F.; Semenas R.,Not identified,10.3390/su11092518,Autonomous robot; Harsh environment; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neutrosophic sets; Sustainability; SWARA; WASPAS-SVNS,30.0,,10,40,MDPI,"The abstract discusses a technical solution for autonomous mobile robots, focusing on safety and sustainability, which does not align clearly with the definitions of strategic, tactical, or operational levels in a marketing context.",scopus-autonomous,10,10,Application of sustainability principles for harsh environment exploration by autonomous robot,2019
"Purpose: Interorganizational (IO) cooperation has been examined primarily as a role-based concept. This research seeks to extend this concept by examining a distinct mode of IO cooperation: favor-based cooperation. This concept refers to voluntary exchanges of preferential treatments between boundary personnel across organizations that are perceived as going beyond the requirements of their role relationships. Methodology/Approach: A qualitative case research design is used to build a grounded theoretical framework on favor-based cooperation. The empirical basis of the proposed framework includes around 300 favor incidents gathered through multiple sources to get a broad and balanced view of the phenomenon. Theoretically, the author employs role theory to conceptualize favor-based cooperation as qua persona, extra-role behavior; additionally, he draws on transaction cost economics (TCE) to examine the value of favor-based cooperation as a means of adaptation relative to TCE relational contracting. Findings: As an extra-role behavior, the added value of favor-based cooperation lies in its capability to provide extra flexibility in the system via informal consent to adaptation requests and preferred access to exchange partner’s time availability. But this mode of cooperation involves a high risk of opportunism when a lot is at stake. Thus, favor-based cooperation best suits IO exchanges that require highly frequent but lowly consequential coordinated adaptation and can enhance IO value creation beyond role-based cooperation (relational contracting) in these situations. Since favor-based cooperation involves transgressing the market forces, it ill-suits IO exchanges that require autonomous adaptations. As a qua persona behavior, favor-based cooperation first and foremost serves the interests of the individuals involved. Thus, whereas interorganizational interest alignment provides sufficient incentive for beneficial role-based cooperation to occur, beneficial favor-based cooperation also requires organizational-individual interest alignment. Research Implications: The inclusion of the favor-based cooperation concept in the study of IO cooperation helps address the overlooked individual aspect of IO cooperation. In the role-based approach that is typical in research on IO cooperation, boundary personnel are viewed as organizational agents who act to maximize their respective organizational interests. In viewing IO cooperation as qua persona behavior (as in the case of favor-based cooperation), the current research explicitly accounts for boundary personnel’s individual interests. While individual interests do account for certain harmful behaviors (e.g., buying business or covering poor performance), they also account for beneficial behaviors that have not been adequately accounted for in role-based theories of IO cooperation. For example, it is individual interests (e.g., the desire to help a friend) that motivate some boundary persons to exert extra efforts to accommodate exchange partner’s unplanned requests for adaptation. Accordingly, knowledge of how the individual interests of the decision-makers affect IO cooperative activities and the outcomes of these activities (via, e.g., favor behaviors) can enhance the explanatory power of theories of cooperation. For example, favor-based cooperation is beneficial particularly in certain exchange situations where role-based cooperation (TCE relational contracting) will likely fail, such as exchange situations that require highly frequent (but lowly consequential) coordinated adaptations. Knowledge of how boundary personnel’s individual interests affect IO cooperation and its outcomes via favor behaviors is also relevant for the understanding of the incentive required for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. According to the role-based view, boundary personnel’s personal motivation is irrelevant. Accordingly, IO interest alignment established via, e.g., mutual credible commitment provides sufficient incentive for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. But to the extent that boundary personnel’s individual interests are relevant, IO interest alignment is necessary but insufficient; organizational-individual interest alignment within each participating organization is also needed for mutually beneficial IO cooperation to occur. Practical Implications: Findings have implications for the role of favor-based cooperation in organizations and effective management of this mode of cooperation. While many organizations appear to value favor-based cooperation, its role is not without controversy, as some scholars view it as harmful behavior that should be discouraged. The findings of this research support a balanced view. Favor-based cooperation is an ultra-flexible means of coordinated adaptation that can help organizations respond effectively to accelerating change in their business environment. However, favor-based cooperation may not be the optimal cooperative mechanism when a lot is at stake; thus, in most exchange situations it should play only a supplemental role. Moreover, this mode of cooperation involves a high probability of misuse. Findings yield unobtrusive measures for effective management of favor exchanges. To benefit from these informal and discretionary cooperative activities, organizations need to develop organizational-individual interest alignment by economic and social incentives. They need to provide boundary personnel with decision criteria to help them select and structure beneficial favor exchange opportunities, and sufficient discretion and resources to realize these opportunities. Originality/Value/Contribution: This research extends the role-based IO cooperation concept to include favor-based cooperation–a qua persona and extra-role behavior. To the author’s knowledge, this research is the first in-depth investigation of this mode of IO cooperation. The findings highlight the distinct scope of favor-based cooperation, specify its added value and downsides as a means of adaptation, and explain the incentive required for beneficial favor-based cooperation to occur. Given that TCE currently has a prominent role in the IO marketing literature, by specifying the value of favor-based cooperation relative to TCE modes of cooperation the current research helps position favor-based cooperation within mainstream IO marketing research. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Nguyen A.,Strategic,10.1080/1051712X.2020.1787025,adaptation; business marketing; extra-role behavior; favor exchange; industrial marketing; Interorganizational cooperation; relational contracting; social exchange; transaction cost economics; value creation,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the concept of favor-based cooperation in interorganizational contexts, focusing on how individual interests align with organizational goals to enhance cooperation.

"We analyze the changes in the management of corporate communication due to the influence of new technologies, using as a case study the market of advertising agencies in the Autonomous Community of Aragon (Spain). In order to determine if the gender of those in management positions of the advertisers influences the way of managing the new business environment, a descriptive analysis was carried out using the focus group as a research technique. As a study variable, gender was selected, so two different sessions were held, one with men and the other with women, in order to analyze the characteristics of the advertiser vs. agency relationship. The main conclusion we reached in this research is that there is a different interest for men and women in relation to the different parameters of analysis. While men paid more attention to external competitiveness and the need to react quickly and forcefully to changes, women were more concerned about the disappearance of interdepartmental borders and the way marketing decisions are made. © 2018 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada.

"Purpose: Big data analytics (BDA) is becoming a strategic tool to harness data to achieve business efficiencies. While business-to-customer organizations have adopted BDA, its adoption in business-to-business (B2B) has been slow, raising concerns about the lack of understanding of the need to adopt BDA. Little knowledge exists on the subject and the purpose of this study is to examine BDA adoption needs among B2B organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) following the six-step SLR guidelines of Templier and Paré (2015) involved 1,051 articles, which were content analyzed. Findings: The authors offer two-pronged findings. First, on the basis of the SLR, the authors develop a new four-category classification scheme of needs to adopt BDA and present a consolidated review of the current knowledge base along with these categories (i.e. innovation, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and digital transformation). Second, underpinned by the theory of organizational motivation and literature evidence, the authors develop propositions and a corresponding model of BDA adoption needs. The authors show that BDA adoption among B2B organizations is driven by the need to augment customer lifetime value, champion the change, improve managerial decision cycle-time, tap into social media benefits and align with market transformation. Research limitations/implications: The results facilitate theory development as the study creates a new classification scheme of needs and a model of needs to adopt BDA in large B2B organizations. Practical implications: The findings will serve as a guideline framework for managers to examine their BDA adoption needs and strategize its adoption.

"Machine learning is bringing us self-driving cars, medical diagnoses, and language translation, but how can machine learning help marketers improve marketing decisions? Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to “big data,” and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight—the soul—the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for “what-if” and “but-for” applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul.

"Purpose: Under the big data background, there are many influencing factors for investors of new energy vehicles (NEV), and government subsidies promote the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to provide solutions for the sustainable development of NEV. Design/methodology/approach: The sustainable marketing strategy of NEV in China is put forward. This paper first analyzes the subsidy policy effect of NEV under the background of big data. It then establishes the online optimal leasing strategy under multiple strategy choices and the online leasing strategy of multiple vehicles under the inflation market. Findings: With the fixed cost of NEV in each lease period, the optimal competition ratio of online decision-makers will continue to decrease with the increase of the difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies. In the decision-making of renting and purchasing multiple vehicles, the general strategy competition ratio is 2.922, while the optimal competition ratio of the online renting and purchasing strategy proposed by the research is 2.723. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the limited data and information collected, so the optimal decision-making model has some limitations. The authors need to find more representative data to optimize the model. Practical implications: As an emerging industry, NEV have developed rapidly in recent years. Based on the online algorithm and competitive ratio theory, this paper solves the decision-making problem of operators and gives the optimal strategy to promote the green development of the new energy vehicle industry. Originality/value: This paper proposes the optimal strategy for online investors of new energy vehicle operators by combining online algorithm and competitive ratio theory. The numerical analysis results of the optimal online model under multi strategy selection show that with the same difference between prepaid funds and government subsidies, the time point will be delayed and the time point will be advanced as the cost of leasing NEV in each period increases. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Daifen T.,Tactical,10.1108/JEIM-02-2021-0087,Big data; Big data economy; Competitive ratio; Lease-purchase model; New energy vehicles; Online algorithm,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the establishment of optimal leasing strategies and competition ratios for new energy vehicles, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into structured, actionable plans.",scopus-big data,20,60,Evaluate the sustainable marketing strategy to optimal online leasing of new energy vehicles under the background big data economy,2022

"Purpose: Digital technologies, digitalised consumers and the torrent of customer data have been transforming marketing practice. In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts. Findings: Drawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a ‘hacking marketing’ approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries. Practical implications: This study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study’s results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Hafezieh N.; Pollock N.; Ryan A.,Strategic,10.1108/JEIM-12-2021-0530,Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Digitalised consumers; Expertise; Hacking; Occupations; Practice,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of digital transformation in marketing, focusing on how organizations can develop new marketing expertise and practices.

"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms&#x2019; financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria&#x0027;s. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig.&#x00A0;1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management&#x0027;s post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study&#x0027;s findings were used to develop Fig.&#x00A0;2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management&#x0027;s support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study&#x0027;s hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE&#x0027;s critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management&#x0027;s decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations&#x2019; FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context.

"Social media contains a massive amount of information, which provides researchers and practitioners with an invaluable source of data to conduct research from end-users' perspectives, in order to influence firm strategic choices. Although an extensive amount of research has been developed in B2C and B2B marketing context, few social media studies take a dive into potential linkages between external and internal marketing contexts in an industry specific paradigm. This study aims to bridge B2C and B2B social media marketing, by adopting the outside-in perspective as theoretical lens. Using a large-scale dataset, collected from a micro-blogging site, and consumer-oriented information assembled from multiple sources, we empirically examine the inter-relationship between firm-generated messages, consumer digital engagement, and firm sales performance in the movie industry. Theoretically, this study builds upon the outside-in perspective and extends the current knowledge of the outside-in perspective to the social media context. It also bridges the B2C and B2B marketing literature by demonstrating that the insight garnered from B2C social media interactions should be integrated into the B2B firm interactions, communications, and decision makings.

"The increased availability of social media big data has created a unique challenge for marketing decision-makers; turning this data into useful information. One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers. These findings have the potential to improve influencer identification effectiveness and efficiency, and thus improve influencer marketing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Harrigan P.; Daly T.M.; Coussement K.; Lee J.A.; Soutar G.N.; Evers U.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102246,Big data; Influencers; Market mavens; Social media; Twitter,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research focuses on identifying market mavens using social media data, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"This study examines the experience of marketing departments to become fully data-driven decision-making organizations. We evaluate an organic approach of departmental sensemaking and an administered approach by which top management increase the influence of analytics skilled employees. Data collection commenced with 15 depth interviews of marketing and analytics professionals in the US and Europe involved in the implementation of big data analytics (BDA) and was followed by a survey data of 298 marketing and analytics middle management professionals at United States based firms. The survey data supports the logic that BDA sensemaking is initiated by top management and is comprised of four primary activities: external knowledge acquisition, improving digitized data quality, big data analytics experimentation and big data analytics information dissemination. Top management drives progress toward data-driven decision-making by facilitating sensemaking and by increasing the influence of BDA skilled employees. This study suggests that while a shift toward enterprise analytics increases the quality of resource available to the marketing department, this approach could stymie the quality of marketing insights gained from BDA.

"In the era of big data, many business organizations consider data analytics skills as important criteria in the acquisition of qualified applicants. As numerous managerial decisions in the field of marketing are becoming evidence-based, business schools have integrated case studies about different stages of data analytics such as problem identification, data collection, data processing, data analysis and data visualization in order to improve the knowledge of marketing students. Although case studies can provide a good theoretical foundation about data analytics in the field of marketing, but they may not be sufficient for building analytical skills from a technical perspective.

"Academics and businesses alike tend to fail at understanding how the IoT revolution is monetized. We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial-and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection. © 2021 by the authors.

"Online lifestyles have been shown to reflect and affect consumers’ preferences across a wide range of online scenarios. In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference.

"Big data analytics has become a significant trend for many businesses as a result of the daily acquisition of enormous volumes of data. This information has been gathered because it may be important for dealing with complicated problems including fraud, marketing, healthcare, and cyber security. Analytics are used by big businesses like Facebook and Google to analyse and make decisions about their massive volumes of collected data. Such analyses and decisions impact both the present and the future of technology. The inherent non-linear properties in huge data may be captured by deep learning (DL) algorithms using automated feature extraction techniques. In order to estimate renewable energy, energy consumption, demand, and supply, among other things, over the short, medium, and long term, a complete and in-depth investigation of generative, hybrid, and discriminative DL models is being conducted.

"Social media adoption has accelerated the generation and dissemination of content, allowing for the communication of important issues like sustainability and climate change. The current study seeks to explore the evolution of sustainability in social media research through network and bibliometric analysis. The bibliographic themes in the field have been studied using citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrence and content analysis using the VOSviewer software. The Scopus database has been used to survey the literature from 2001 to 2023. To ensure accuracy in the data obtained, 757 documents were finalized through numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results suggest that sustainable development, marketing, perception, decision making and innovation were some of the most frequently studied topics in the area. The United States, China and the United Kingdom were the top contributing countries and Sustainability Switzerland, Journal Of Cleaner Production and Environmental Science and Pollution Research were some of the highly productive journals. Keywords such as big data, business development, economic and social effects, economic development and public attitude were less frequently studied, providing scope for future exploration.

"Purpose: In the current business environment, more uncertain than ever before, understanding consumer behavior is an integral part of an organization's strategic planning and execution process. It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in data driven-marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the “right” customers, to “keep” and “grow” them and to sustain “growth” and “profitability”. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses, 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included retail, BFSI, healthcare and government, automobile, telecommunication, transport and logistics and IT. Other industries represented were aviation, marketing research and consulting, hospitality, advertising and media and human resource. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for DDM. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders and Leaders based on their “current level of investments” and “willingness to enhance investments” soon. Research limitations/implications: With storming digital age and the development of analytics, the process of decision-making has gained significant importance. Judgment and intuition too are critical to the process. Choosing an appropriate action cannot be done strictly on a rational basis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of DDM. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; however, attitudes and social factors are equally important. Originality/value: There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Grandhi B.; Patwa N.; Saleem K.,Strategic,10.1108/EMJB-09-2018-0054,Customer centric; Data-driven marketing; Digital data; Digital marketing and marketing investment; Marketing analytics; Marketing dashboard; Marketing metrics; ROMI (return on marketing investment) and diffusion of innovation; Value proposition,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the importance of data-driven marketing (DDM) in enhancing shareholder value and customer centricity, which are strategic goals for organizations.

"Today's marketers are increasingly faced with the need to collect and interpret data to aid firm strategic decision making. At the same time, there has been an explosion of text-based data and numerous advances in big data that enable marketers to mine the collection and aggregation of text. However, for many marketers there is a need to better understand how textual data can go beyond mere descriptive metrics to instead help solve real marketing problems. With this paper, we take a step in this direction. We first review key concepts and terms that are relevant to understanding how text analysis operates, as well as a new development in custom dictionary creation that expands the topics possible with text analysis. Next, we develop the FTTA grid, a new framework that enables text-derived metrics to inform actionable strategies for marketers.

"Context: businesses have always used data to make decisions, but the amount, variety, and speed of data have increased dramatically in recent years. This fact led to the emergence of big data, which in turn intensified innovation, led to new services and products such as real-time traffic information and personalized marketing and delivery services. While big data has led to efficiency gains, it has also sparked a new debate in antitrust: to what extent, if any, could data become a competitive concern? Objective: this article is a case study on the Brazilian retail market based on recent literature on barriers to entry fostered by data-based activities and the importance of data as an asset capable of creating market power and giving rise to anti-competitive practices. Method: a bibliographical review was carried out regarding the importance of data as a possible asset that creates barriers to entry, as well as the interpretation of the Brazilian antitrust authority – Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade), in recent mergers, in addition to an exploratory analysis of data on access and revenue of the main retail players in different market segments and business types. Conclusions: the article concludes that, taking into account the case study, it is not evident that big data leads to highly competitive advantages in the retail sector in Brazil and that competitive concerns do not extend to all data-intensive markets, as data can be segmented and provide different competitive advantages that do not imply relevant barriers to the Brazilian retail sector. © 2024, Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE).

"Purpose: This research aimed to analyze and prioritize the factors affecting sustainable marketing (SM) and sustainable operation (SO) of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs through big data adoption (BDA). Design/methodology/approach: The technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical base and data were gathered from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN). Findings: The findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS. Practical implications: The findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development. Originality/value: The manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations. However, the associations between BDA and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs have been less explored.

"A persona is a widely used tool in the design field to help understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. Quantitatively creating personas is gaining importance for its greater representability, objectivity, and fast creative speed. However, quantitative personas built using traditional statistical methods may not reflect the marketing goals of decision-makers, and they mainly focus on categorizing existing users rather than predicting target customers. To address the research gap, this study proposes a guideline to create a predictive persona by using data-mining algorithms resulting in personas that can be validated. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and credibility of personas to effectively predict new customers for target marketing. We demonstrate a step-by-step guideline for creating the proposed predictive persona using real user data, validating its credibility, and comparing its predictive power against traditional quantitative personas.

"Rapid changes in digital consumer behaviour, influenced by exponential adoption of smartphones, require timely and sophisticated responses from retailers to these consumer needs. With a growing amount of big data available, fashion retailers need to innovate and develop more sophisticated analytics for new consumer behaviours such as m-commerce. This research has considered how Google Analytics data can be applied to develop customer journey maps to understand digital consumer behaviour. A multi-method research design was used, incorporating an innovative mobile eye tracking technology and mobile fashion consumer data from Google Analytics. Digital customers’ shopping journeys on the fashion retailer's website were mapped using data sourced from eye tracking and Google Analytics, gathered in parallel. The comparison of these shopping journeys allowed a critical evaluation of the precision and usefulness of the Google Analytics database. Google Analytics tracked only half of the digital users’ activities, whereas eye tracking data documented digital consumers’ interaction with all elements of the fashion retailer's website. The conclusion reached is that eye tracking can be used to audit the Google Analytics database for potential gaps in data and also to inform and improve marketing decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Tupikovskaja-Omovie Z.; Tyler D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102294,Consumer shopping journey; Digital consumer; Eye tracking; Fashion m-retail; Fashion retail; Google analytics; Marketing analytics,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research focuses on applying Google Analytics data and innovative eye tracking technology to better understand and optimize digital consumer behavior in fashion retail, aligning with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and user engagement.",scopus-big data,10,70,Eye tracking technology to audit google analytics: Analysing digital consumer shopping journey in fashion m-retail,2021
"With the rise of machine learning and ""big data,""many large yet spurious relationships between variables are discovered, leveraged by marketing communications, and publicized in the media. Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to many large-magnitude relationships between variables that do not signal causal effects. This exposure may carry a substantial cost. Seven studies demonstrate that the magnitudes of relationships between variables can distort consumers' judgments about whether those relationships reflect causal effects. Specifically, consumers often use a magnitude heuristic: consumers infer that relationships with larger perceived magnitudes are more likely to reflect causal effects, even when this is not true (and even when relationships' correlations are held constant). In many situations, relying on the magnitude heuristic will distort causality judgments, such as when large-magnitude relationships between variables are spurious, or when normatively extraneous factors (e.g., reference points) distort perceptions of magnitudes. Moreover, magnitude-distorted (mis)perceptions of causality, in turn, distort consumers' purchase and consumption decisions. Since consumers often encounter spurious relationships with large magnitudes in the health domain and in other consequential domains, the magnitude heuristic is likely to lead to biases in some of consumers' most important decisions.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"The sophistication of political campaigns has dramatically increased over recent election cycles through the embracing of big data analytics. Collecting and storing information on actual and potential voters, volunteers, and donors has produced extensive databases that are then used to guide microtargeting efforts related to advertising, organizing, and fundraising efforts. But building, maintaining, and analyzing this data are costly in itself. This paper looks at two aspects of data-driven political fundraising: precision and selectiveness, with respect to the alignment of the ideology of potential donors and the ideology of the candidate. Specifically, the proposed model is used to determine the optimal precision in estimating a donor’s location on the political ideology spectrum and the optimal targeting decision for fundraising solicitations given that estimate. Analysis of the model produces guidance for changes in solicitation cost and donation size. The results produced by the model are considered in light of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The analysis suggests that the Clinton campaign’s larger donation size likely played a greater role than did the campaign’s higher solicitation cost in terms of targeting. The model is also consistent with the Clinton campaign’s higher expenditures on analytics, given their larger donation size and solicitation cost. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Walker D.; Nowlin E.L.,Tactical,10.1080/15377857.2018.1457590,Analytics; big data; data-driven marketing; direct marketing; fundraising; microtargeting; political campaigning,5.0,,5,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses specific methods of data-driven political fundraising, focusing on precision and selectiveness in targeting potential donors, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Purpose: Big data capabilities have the potential to completely transform conventional methods of doing business. Nevertheless, the role of big data capabilities in fostering green marketing capabilities and improving green competitive advantage is still not fully understood. To add new knowledge, this paper aims to propose a moderated mediation model to strengthen green competitive advantage in a big data environment. The model introduces both the mediating role of green marketing capabilities and the moderating role of big data capabilities. We developed and empirically tested a moderated mediation model. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we have adopted a survey-based methodology. The study collected data from 337 managers and empirically analyzed it to test the theoretical model of moderated mediation. We employed structural equation modeling for empirical analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that organizational learning improves green marketing capabilities, whereas the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage is insignificant. The mediating role of green marketing capabilities in the relationship between organizational learning and green competitive advantage was statistically significant, indicating that green marketing capabilities serve as a bridge between organizational learning and green competitive advantage. Big data capabilities moderate the relationship between organizational learning and green marketing capabilities. The moderated mediation was also significant, highlighting that big data capabilities further strengthen the indirect effects of organizational learning on green competitive advantage via green marketing capabilities. Originality/value: This paper delivers theoretical and practical understandings of the importance of organizational learning and big data capabilities. Similarly, it extends current knowledge and provides key insights for managerial decision-making. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Zameer H.; Wang Y.; Yasmeen H.,Strategic,10.1108/BPMJ-09-2023-0691,Big data; Green competitive advantage; Green marketing capabilities; Organizational learning,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the importance of big data capabilities and organizational learning in enhancing green marketing capabilities and competitive advantage, which aligns with long-term strategic goals and planning of the organization.",scopus-big data,60,20,Strengthening green competitive advantage through organizational learning and green marketing capabilities in a big data environment: a moderated-mediation model,2024
"Business majors will encounter big data, and many will use data visualization tools to gain valuable insights and make strategic business decisions. However, core information systems classes for all business majors focus on improving information literacy but rarely include exercises with data visualization tools like Tableau. This study seeks to understand the perceptions business students have of Tableau after using it for several activities during a semester-long core business class. Specifically, the study examines the effects of gender, age, and major to understand how each factor affects student perceptions of Tableau including how easy it is to use, its value in the workplace, and how it compares to Excel. Tableau appealed to females just as much as males and to older students just as much as younger students. Tableau engaged with some majors more than others and appealed to CIS, Finance and Entrepreneurship majors more so than Marketing and Management majors (which include Management, Sport Management, Hospitality and Tourism, and Business Law).

"The collection of big data from different sources such as the internet of things, social media and search engines has created significant opportunities for business-to-business (B2B) industrial marketing organizations to take an analytical view in developing programmatic marketing approaches for online display advertising. Cleansing, processing and analyzing of such large datasets create challenges for marketing organizations — particularly for real-time decision making and comparative implications. Importantly, there is limited research for such interplays. By utilizing a problematization approach, this paper contributes through the exploration of links between big data, programmatic marketing and real-time processing and relevant decision making for B2B industrial marketing organizations that depend on big data-driven marketing or big data-savvy managers. This exploration subsequently encompasses appropriate big data sources and effective batch and real-time processing linked with structured and unstructured datasets that influence relative processing techniques.

"With the increasing use and availability of computing power and raised consumer power comes the need in competitive markets to produce and offer products and services that provide as precisely as possible the exact features of offerings that match customer requirements, with as little waste as possible. Further, customers have different thresholds of willingness to pay for sets of features. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and model the merging of supply chain strategies with the marketing decisions, which is key to the overall optimization of aspects of a firm’s strategy, including design of its products and their features, pricing, and positioning. The method used was to create the comprehensive modeling approach that represents these challenges not based on products, but based on individual features of those products, atomistically. The theoretical contribution made is the integration of supply chain optimization approaches, that are essentially based on the resource based view of the firm and focus on cost, with the marketing orientation approach to product design, pricing and marketing strategies. Further, this theoretical contribution recognises in its models that mass customization provides for individualization of features offered to each customer, at prices that reflect their assessed willingness to pay. There are many practical implications: many firms are moving towards full customization of feature sets, and increasingly pricing in a customized manner, and this trend will continue in practice as big data applications in markets go further and become more cost efficient. The integration of the marketing view and the resource-based operations view allows for a fully integrated view of competitive strategy and the design of products and services, so that firms can profit optimize their offerings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Wacker J.G.; Samson D.,Strategic,10.1007/s12063-021-00218-8,Business strategy; Marketing management; Micro-strategy; Modeling business strategies; Operations management; Operations marketing integration; Optimisation; Product features; Recource based view; Strategic integration; Supply chain management,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract addresses the integration of supply chain strategies with marketing decisions, focusing on long-term optimization of product design, pricing, and positioning, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-big data,70,15,Beyond supply chain management: jointly optimising operations/ supply and the marketing mix,2021

"Nowadays, it remains unclear whether the accumulation of Internet buzz can accurately predict customer preferences and buying intentions. We study two related perspectives with regard to what people talk about online and what they intend to do in the adoption phase to offer advice to companies aiming to excel in online marketing efforts. Drawing on the consumption value theory, we examine buyers’ discussions about and intention to use wearable devices for a sample of consumers in Taiwan. A framework is advanced to explore the results of big data analysis employing text-mining techniques (i.e., what people talk about) and survey-based research using structural equation modelling (i.e., what people intend to do). Functional, emotional and conditional values surfaced as the highest Internet buzzes of wearable devices. Conversely, emotional, epistemic and functional values emerged as the most influential drivers of customers’ adoption intention. Our findings suggest that different value dimensions are relevant at different points of the purchase-related decision-making process. Some values animate Internet discussions that pertain to the pre-purchase information search stage, and others appear significant during the formation of people’s purchase intentions.

"With the rise of social media platforms for marketing purposes, the central dilemma for researchers and policymakers lies in choosing effective data analysis tools to improve marketing decisions. In the academic literature, numerous articles have discussed clustering techniques for analysing social media data, from a perspective of data mining or social media marketing. However, few studies have attempted to synthesise results obtained from both perspectives. This research aims to (1) offer a structured overview of existing literature on clustering methods for marketing strategies and (2) compare three topic modelling techniques applied to extract the main topics evoked in the corpus of papers. Indeed, topic modelling emerges as a valuable tool for extracting relevant information from big data in general and more specifically from extensive scientific papers. Based on a thematic analysis, the extracted topics were classified according to the following categories: fields, marketing strategies and technologies. Results prove that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most effective technique in this context. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of clustering techniques and technologies used for marketing strategies in studied fields.

"Think tanks and their roles in rendering expertise in policy advice have been the subject of historical and ongoing research in policy sciences. However, the widening trend of digital behaviors of think tanks in the social media era is yet to be investigated. While social media is reshaping the political ecology and challenging conventional sources of knowledge, it also serves as a potential channel for think tanks to publicly share their expertise and policy advice with the public and decision-makers, thus evolving into “digital advocators.” Based on social media big data methods, this paper has constructed two sets of new think tank indicators with “network centrality” of social media accounts and “ripple effect” of social media citations from Facebook and Twitter to capture and observe the digital activities of 207 prominent think tanks in 62 countries or regions. We have concluded that think tanks have displayed their opinion and values and increased visibility as digital advocators by spreading expertise on social media platforms with online marketing skills. With various values and ideas, social media not only is hosting massive policy advocacy activities and being an expertise spreading arena for think tanks but has also been changing the ecology of the think tank industry and expertise markets. © The Author(s) 2023.

"The success of creative products depends on the felt experience of consumers. Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades.

"Purpose: The dynamic yet volatile nature of tourism and travel industry in a competitive environment calls for enhanced marketing intelligence and analytics, especially for those entities with limited marketing budgets. The past decade has witnessed an increased use of user-generated content (UGC) analysis as a marketing tool to make better informed decisions. Likewise, textual data analysis of UGC has gained much attention among tourism and hospitality scholars. Nonetheless, most of the scholarly works have focused on the singular application of an existing method or technique rather than using a multi-method approach. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel Web analytics methodology to examine online reviews posted by tourists in real time and assist decision-makers tasked with marketing strategy and intelligence. Design/methodology/approach: For illustration, the case of tourism campaign in India was undertaken. A total of 305,298 reviews were collected, and after filtering, 276,154 reviews were qualified for analysis using a string of models. Descriptive charts, sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling and machine learning algorithms for real-time classification were applied. Findings: Using big data from TripAdvisor, a total of 145 tourist destinations were clustered based on tourists’ perceptions. Further exploration of each cluster through topic modeling was conducted, which revealed interesting insights into satisfiers and dissatisfiers of different clusters of destinations. The results supported the use of the proposed multi-method Web-analytics approach. Practical implications: The proposed machine learning model demonstrated that it could provide real-time information on the sentiments in each incoming review about a destination. This information might be useful for taking timely action for improvisation or controlling a service situation. Originality/value: In terms of Web-analytics and UGC, a comprehensive analytical model to perform an end-to-end understanding of tourist behavior patterns and offer the potential for real-time interpretation is rarely proposed.

A centralized model and two Stackelberg game models (an online-retailer-led decentralized model and a manufacturer-led decentralized model) were constructed and solved. The zero wholesale price-side-payment contract and greedy wholesale price-side-payment contract were introduced into the green supply chain for coordination. The study found that: (1) the increase in demand attenuation coefficient, green sensitivity coefficient, and big data targeted advertising sensitivity coefficient will be beneficial to the growth of total consumer demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit; (2) supply chain coordination is necessary because greenness, demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit under the centralized model are higher than those under two decentralized models; (3) two contracts can achieve the coordination of the green supply chain, and the profits of the manufacturer and online retailer under the contract are greater than those under the decentralized model. The results can provide insights for promoting green supply chain operations. © 2022 by the authors.",Hu H.; Li Y.; Li M.,Tactical,10.3390/jtaer17030053,big data targeted advertising; coordination; green supply chain; greenness; online retailer; optimal decisions,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses specific models and contracts for coordinating decisions within a green supply chain, focusing on targeted advertising and its impact on demand and profits.

"Public libraries reflect the contemporary way of life. In the era of the digital data age, actions carried out through libraries can be traced and analyzed to monitor the demand for library services. This study presents the development and utilization of Korea's National Library Big Data Platform (NLBDP), which was constructed to collect operational data from public libraries in the country and to build national open data platform for the participating libraries and for public use. This study analyzed 17 application cases that utilized NLBDP in order to understand the way the platform has been used. The findings showed that the types of data analyzed so far have been somewhat limited. It suggests needs for further enhancing the data quality and for diversifying data sources, such as individual local library operational data, surveys, demographics, news, and social media. The results also revealed that NLBDP has been utilized for seven distinct purposes: library operations and strategic planning; social trend analysis; collection management; redesigning library space; recruiting new patrons; library marketing; and non-library applications. Building an infrastructure for networked data analysis not only enables evidence-based decision-making in public libraries, but also extracts timely topics that can be developed as useful services for their community. The findings of this study highlighted the necessity to formulate national library data policies and gather data capable of measuring the social impact of libraries. © (2023).

"Purpose: This paper aims to highlight how big social data (BSD) and analytics exploitation may help destination management organisations (DMOs) to understand tourist behaviours and destination experiences and images. Gathering data from two different sources, Flickr and Twitter, textual and visual contents are used to perform different analytics tasks to generate insights on tourist behaviour and the affective aspects of the destination image. Design/methodology/approach: This work adopts a method based on a multimodal approach on BSD and analytics, considering multiple BSD sources, different analytics techniques on heterogeneous data types, to obtain complementary results on the Salento region (Italy) case study. Findings: Results show that the generated insights allow DMOs to acquire new knowledge about discovery of unknown clusters of points of interest, identify trends and seasonal patterns of tourist demand, monitor topic and sentiment and identify attractive places. DMOs can exploit insights to address its needs in terms of decision support for the management and development of the destination, the enhancement of destination attractiveness, the shaping of new marketing and communication strategies and the planning of tourist demand within the destination. Originality/value: The originality of this work is in the use of BSD and analytics techniques for giving DMOs specific insights on a destination in a deep and wide fashion. Collected data are used with a multimodal analytic approach to build tourist characteristics, images, attitudes and preferred destination attributes, which represent for DMOs a unique mean for problem-solving, decision-making, innovation and prediction. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Solazzo G.; Maruccia Y.; Lorenzo G.; Ndou V.; Del Vecchio P.; Elia G.,Strategic,10.1108/MBE-11-2020-0156,Big data analytics; Big data analytics; DMO; Tourism destination management; Tourist behaviour,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The paper focuses on how big social data and analytics can support destination management organizations (DMOs) in understanding tourist behaviors and enhancing destination attractiveness, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making processes.",scopus-big data,60,25,Extracting insights from big social data for smarter tourism destination management,2022

"Recent developments in blockchain technology have enabled the development of wallet applications for storing peoples’ cryptocurrency reserves. Cryptocurrency wallet applications could deploy affiliate marketing processes to increase the visibility of their products. From these affiliate marketing processes, supply chain firms in the air forwarding sector that seek to advertise their services to a larger audience could be benefited. This research examines whether affiliate marketing initials of cryptocurrency wallet applications affect their digital marketing efficiency, as well as whether air forwarding firms’ website visibility could be benefited from them. After collecting the required Web Analytic data, the authors performed statistical analysis (correlations and linear regressions), followed by Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) macroanalysis and Hybrid Modeling (HM) microanalysis to assess the outcomes of cryptocurrency wallet applications’ affiliate marketing programs. Hence, from the deployed methodology, valuable insights arose. The first part of the produced outcomes concerns the effect of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics on their digital marketing results. The increased implications of affiliate marketing metrics (referring domains, backlinks, etc.) decrease the number of pages their visitors see. Regarding the air forwarder firms’ website visibility, specific metrics (branded and referral traffic) were increased and others (social traffic) were decreased from the increment of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics (backlinks, internal links, etc.).

"‘Health-food’ is a health marketing term used for suggesting consumers, the specifically designed healthy diet for high nutrition and body growth. A health-food mainly includes organic food, natural and non-GMO foods, special foods for allergic people like gluten-free, lactose-free and dairy-free products and low fat-high protein keto diet products such as beans, legumes, nuts and seeds. Food consumption patterns of ‘health-foods’ and their preferences are constantly changing all over the world, due to change in urban-lifestyle patterns leading to high stress, anxiety and health related diseases like diabetes and obesity etc. In today’s era “Eating healthy and living healthy” is a most suitable mantra for living a good life. According to the global health and wellness food market report, it is expected that during 2020-2024, the size of the health and wellness food market is likely to rise by US$ 235.94, advancing at a CAGR of 6 percent. Organic and gluten-free foods are considered to be on top when talking about the health-foods. There is need to further explore the mindset of consumers regarding health-foods and their consumption, since its benefits looks promising but very little is known about the consumers’ beliefs, motivations and values driving their decision in making the purchase of these foods. Various researches indicates that a better understanding of consumers' perception of health foods are the main factors for market positioning, growth and for negotiating market opportunities. Main objective of the paper is to understand the perception of consumer using Big Data analysis so as to assist health food manufacturers to improve food products according to customer choices and preferences. In this study, by using social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, posts, and reviews that have played a major role in increased sales of health foods, we will primarily concentrate on understanding the public perception regarding organic and gluten-free foods. The study will also provide in-depth insights about health-foods in form of positive, negative and neutral sentiments of the consumers using the social media data from Talkwalker and Google Trends. This research would help organic food and glutenfree food manufacturers to understand the consumer perception and to improve marketing return on investment. The results of the study discussed the 'most talked about' and anticipated product innovation in health-food sectors such as new snacks, fast food (pizza, pasta and noodles) and desserts.

"This paper studies a three-tier food delivery service supply chain (FDSSC) composed of one restaurant that is responsible for providing food and catering services, one food delivery platform that is responsible for providing big data marketing, and one rider that is responsible for providing food delivery services. Then, differential game theory is used to model and derive the objective functions and equilibrium strategies of the FDSSC members in four scenarios: decentralization, independent delivery, independent production, and centralization. The effects of cooperation patterns among the FDSSC members, consumer channel preferences, commission rates, and food delivery fees of the food delivery platform on the optimal decision-making and performance of the FDSSC members are discussed. Through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis of essential parameters, we summarize the following conclusions. First, whether it is independent production and independent delivery, any cooperation between the FDSSC members is always beneficial for the profit improvement of all FDSSC members. Therefore, the restaurant, food delivery platform, and rider should actively seek pairwise or tripartite cooperation to achieve common profit enhancement. In addition, when the online channel preference of consumers increases, the restaurant should continuously enhance the food quality and catering service level to ensure an amazing dining experience for consumers, which is conducive to the formation of a healthy dual-channel food sales model. Last, a higher commission rate can increase the profits of the food delivery platform and the whole FDSSC, but it damages the revenue of the restaurant, while a higher food delivery fee can bring more profits to the restaurant and rider. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Ma S.; He Y.; Gu R.; Yeh C.-H.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.103828,Big data marketing; Food delivery platform; Food delivery service; Food supply chain; Pricing,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term cooperation strategies among members of a food delivery service supply chain, focusing on optimizing decisions for profit enhancement and consumer satisfaction.

"This paper develops a methodology for the early detection of reactivation of tourist markets to help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, using Skyscanner data on air passenger searches (>5,000 million) and picks (>600 million), for flights between November 2018 and December 2020, through ForwardKeys. For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10–20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape.

"We develop a flexible content-based search model that links the content preferences of search engine users to query search volume and click-through rates, while allowing content preferences to vary systematically based on the context of a search. Content preferences are defined over latent topics that describe the content of search queries and search result descriptions. Compared with existing applications of topic modeling in marketing and recommendation systems, our proposed approach can simultaneously capture multiple types of information and investigate multiple aspects of behavioral dynamics in a single framework that enables interpretable results for business decision making. To facilitate efficient and scalable inference, we develop a full Bayesian variational inference algorithm. We evaluate our modeling framework using real-world search data for TV shows from the Bing search engine. We illustrate how our model can quantify the content preferences associated with each query and how these preferences vary systematically based on whether the query is observed before, during, or after a TV show is aired. We also show that our model can help the search engine improve its ranking of search results as well as address the cold-start problem for new page links.

"Digital transformation is reshaping the decision making management of the rental service mode in the manufacturing industry, and improving digital detection technology and big data marketing have become effective ways to create value. Based on the three-level rental platform service supply chain network structure composed of manufacturers, rental platform operators and the demand market, a supply chain network equilibrium model considering the digital detection technology input and big data marketing is constructed by using variational inequality and the Nash equilibrium theory, and the optimal decision making conditions of the manufacturers and rental platform operators are derived. Combined with the Euler algorithm design procedure and numerical examples, the influences of the digital detection technology level, big data marketing cost coefficient and cost sharing ratio on the equilibrium state are analyzed. The results show that the input of digital detection technology leads to the increase in profits of each participant in the rental platform service supply chain network and promotes a more coordinated development of the supply chain.

"This study addresses the ubiquitous challenge of using big observational data to identify heterogeneous treatment effects. This problem arises in precision medicine, targeted marketing, personalized education, and many other environments. Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects presents several analytical challenges including high dimensionality and endogeneity issues. We develop a new instrumental variable tree (IVT) approach that incorporates the instrumental variable method into a causal tree (CT) to correct for potential endogeneity biases that may exist in observational data. Our IVT approach partitions subjects into subgroups with similar treatment effects within subgroups and different treatment effects across subgroups. The estimated treatment effects are asymptotically consistent under a set of mild assumptions. Using simulated data, we show our approach has a better coverage rate and smaller mean-squared error than the conventional CT approach. We also demonstrate that an instrumental variable forest (IVF) constructed using IVTs has better accuracy and stratification than a generalized random forest. Finally, by applying the IVF approach to an empirical assessment of laparoscopic colectomy, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity to make accurate comparisons of the heterogeneous effects of the treatment (teaching hospitals) and control (nonteaching hospitals) on different types of patients.

"Retailers need to manage a series of complex decisions relating to numerous products. To reduce this complexity, they have introduced category management practices, which consider groups of similar products (categories) that can be managed separately as single business units (SBUs). Although the concept that the store offer should be organised as a category mix and that this strategy allows for better overall store management is already consolidated, retailers still struggle to adopt an approach to the store performance measurement starting from a category level perspective. Nowadays, the available methods for measuring categories’ performance are quite limited. The current trend sees the measurement of category performance mainly based on sell-out data that are ill-equipped to fully address category management issues. Retailers should broaden their field of analysis not only by focusing on the product/sales perspective but also by including other methodologies such as shopper behaviour analysis. In this regard, the use of technology offers the retail sector new perspectives for those analysis. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the retail analytics topic by presenting a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring. More in detail, we could derive a new key performance indicator, category conversion power (CCP), aimed at analysing and comparing the single categories organised within the store. The research is based on a unique dataset obtained from a real-time locating system (RTLS), which allowed us to collect behavioural data togheter with sell-out data (from POS scanner). We argue that retailers could exploit this new analytical method to gain more understanding at the category level and therefore make data-driven decisions aimed at improving performance at the store level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Pascucci F.; Nardi L.; Marinelli L.; Paolanti M.; Frontoni E.; Gregori G.L.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102880,Big data; Category management; Performance measurement; Retail marketing; RTLS technology; Shopper behaviour,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring, which aligns with tactical decision-making by interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets and structured analysis.",scopus-big data,20,60,Combining sell-out data with shopper behaviour data for category performance measurement: The role of category conversion power,2022
"Big Data Analytics (BDA) solutions are increasingly applied in marketing, with the aim of transforming data available online to market information and competitive intelligence. When businesses encounter risky situations (calculated risks) complex models using BDA are often the go-to solution. However, there is a still a debate if BDA is the best solution in uncertain situations when unexpected phenomena arise. The present study begins to fill this gap using the Colombian context as evidence and a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fs-QCA). The focus shifts from a single cause leading to performance to an analysis of different associations of conditions. There are three major findings-first, in a risky environment, BDA is not a unique condition; a combination of data maturity levels, data skills and a data-driven mindset and culture are necessary to obtain good business performance. Second, even in the era of Big Data, large companies still use simple rules (heuristics) to make decisions which improve their performance. Finally, the environmental state (uncertain, certain, risky) is a moderating factor in the choice between BDA or Heuristics. The results indicate marketing managers should use a multi-model approach incorporating both BDA and heuristics. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Grimaldi D.; Sallan J.M.; Arboleda H.; Sehgal S.,Strategic,10.1080/12460125.2023.2232570,Big Data Analytics; Heuristic; Marketing; Risk; Uncertainty,5.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of Big Data Analytics in marketing, emphasizing the need for a multi-model approach and addressing complex decision-making in uncertain environments, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-big data,60,25,Rethinking the role of uncertainty and risk in Marketing,2023

Outlining industry-demand as a driving force in stimulating a new business data-analytics programme at a medium-sized Australian metropolitan university, the study utilises open-ended interviews with five senior data analytics professionals to find a new matrix of industry expectations. The emerged elements are open-sourced tools based general technical knowledge; specific industry certifications or special skills; technology integration knowledge; cross-industry knowledge such as marketing; project management/agility and decision-making utilising appropriate supporting knowledge. Based on these findings, key learning objectives, an initial structure of the programme and specialisation subjects is proposed for further evaluation through convergent interviewing. We anticipated that the entire design process could be reusable for other similar situations for designing new practical courses in higher education sector. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Miah S.J.; Solomonides I.,Strategic,10.1007/s10639-020-10285-2,Analytics; Big data; Business discipline; Course design; Curriculum; Higher education,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the design of a new business master's degree program based on industry needs and perspectives, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and the nature of educational offerings.

"This study proposes as a key cause of the high failure rates in the implementation of analytical projects for marketing decisions, the discrepancy in the information quality (DIQ) perceived between producers (information technology [IT]) and users (marketing) of knowledge. Given that the DIQ between agents is a determining factor in the success of the ability to data analytics, this study focuses on examining this concept and its causes, specifically the resources related to data analytics that influence DIQ. The results of the surveys carried out with the IT and marketing managers of 95 companies in Spain, analyzed with a comparative methodological approach (dyadic), reveal the sources of the discrepancy, namely, the quality of the data, the technological capabilities, the talent, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) support, and alignment of the data plan with the marketing plan.

"The integration of technology in business strategy increases the complexity of marketing communications and urges the need for advanced marketing performance analytics. Rapid advancements in marketing attribution methods created gaps in the systematic description of the methods and explanation of their capabilities. This paper contrasts theoretically elaborated facilitators and the capabilities of data-driven analytics against the empirically identified classes of marketing attribution. It proposes a novel taxonomy, which serves as a tool for systematic naming and describing marketing attribution methods. The findings allow to reflect on the contemporary attribution methods’ capabilities to account for the specifics of the customer journey, thereby, creating currently lacking theoretical backbone for advancing the accuracy of value attribution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Buhalis D.; Volchek K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102253,Customer journey analytics; Decision-making; Marketing attribution; Multi-channel marketing performance measurement; Taxonomy,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses advanced marketing performance analytics and the systematic description of marketing attribution methods.

"Against the backdrop of the resource-based theory (RBT), this research paper aims to analyze if different types of analytics personnel exist in the context of Big Data Marketing Analytics (BDMA) and to profile the discovered personnel clusters. The study adopted the survey method to collect data in Canada and the United States among the marketing personnel working in firms with at least limited experience in the deployment of BD. The collected data were analyzed with ANOVA and a two-step cluster analysis procedure. The cluster variate included technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge constructs with their relevant indicator variables. The profiling of the clusters was also completed. The findings indicate the existence of two sufficiently large clusters among the marketing personnel. They had very different profiles regarding their gender, decision-making role, BD deployment level in their respective firms, and experience level. This research sheds light on the types of marketing analytics personnel required to implement BDMA successfully. The personnel active in BDMA deployment must have relevant experience in technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge and possess higher decision-making abilities, which enables their firms to proceed successfully to more advanced levels of BDMA deployment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",Haverila M.; Haverila K.,Tactical,10.1057/s41270-024-00305-2,Big Data Marketing Analytics (BDMA); Cluster analysis; Marketing personnel; Profiling,5.0,,15,0,Palgrave Macmillan,The research focuses on analyzing and profiling different types of analytics personnel in the context of Big Data Marketing Analytics.

"Purpose: This study aims to develop a proprietary indicator to measure the digital presence of the institutions: the digital presence index. Design/methodology/approach: This research delves into how nonprofit institutions, specifically business interest associations (BIAs), have developed their internet presence by applying essential digital marketing techniques. To this end, and using big data mining tools, this study analyzes the tracking by internet users of 102 BIAs, with their respective websites in 36 countries in Europe and the USA. In addition, the presence and activity of the institutions included in this study on social networks are considered. Findings: This research serves as a basis for discussing the current gap between social reality and the digitalization of institutions. In this sense, conclusions are drawn on the importance of managerial profiles in decision-making on digitization and the necessary knowledge that, together with Web and social network managers, they must have to articulate the means and techniques that promote the internet presence of the organizations they manage.

"Purpose: Dynamic, volatile, and time-sensitive industries, such as tourism, travel and hospitality require agility and market intelligence to create value and achieve competitive advantage. The aim of the current study is to examine the influence of big data (BD) on the performance of service organizations and to probe for a deeper understanding of implementing BD, based on available technologies. Design/methodology/approach: An ethnographic study was conducted following an abductive approach. A primary qualitative research scheme was used with 35 information technology and database professionals participating in five online focus groups of seven participants each. Analytical themes were developed simultaneously with the literature being revisited throughout the study to ultimately create sets of common themes and dimensions. Findings: BD can help organizations build agility, especially within dynamic industries, to better predict customer behavioral patterns and make tailor-made propositions from the BD. An integrated BD-specific framework is proposed to address value according to the dimensions of need, value, time and utility. Research limitations/implications: Little research exists on the key drivers of BD use for dynamic, real-time and agile businesses. This research adds to the developing literature on BD applications to support organizational decision-making and business performance in the tourism industry. Originality/value: This study responds to scholars’ recent calls for more empirical research with contextual understanding of the use of BD to add value in marketing intelligence within business ecosystems.

"The present study uses a large group decision-making technique to identify and rank the best big data-driven circular economy (BDDCE) practices in the auto-component industry. The data pertaining to the BDDCE practices were collected from the decision-makers in three groups, namely, purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics & marketing function from the auto-component manufacturing industry. First, the consensus on the BDDCE practices within the group was ascertained followed by determining the decision weights using the percentage distributions and subjective weights. This was followed by the by computing the dominance degrees on pairwise comparisons of the BDDCE practices and ranking them using the PROMETHEE II method. The findings indicated that the BDDCE practices that were more inclined towards the enhancement of internal supply chain integration were most preferred and highly ranked by the decisionmakers in the auto-component industry as compared to the practices that were focused on improving the supplier and customer interfaces such as green purchasing, sale of excess inventory, and developing recycling systems for end-of-life products and materials. The high ranked BDDCE practices included minimization of the raw material consumption, plan for reuse, recycle, recovery of material, parts, and reduction of the process waste at the design stage. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Kamble S.S.; Belhadi A.; Gunasekaran A.; Ganapathy L.; Verma S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120567,Automobile industry; Big Data; Circular economy; Large group decision making; PROMETHEE; Sustainability,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The study focuses on identifying and ranking best practices in the auto-component industry, which involves structured decision-making and clear targets related to big data-driven circular economy practices.

ExC describes the technological and algorithmic extension of (and annexation of) cognition in a consumption context. ExC provides a framework to enhance the understanding of the impact of pervasive computing and smart technology on consumer decision-making and the behavioural impacts of consumer analytics. To this end, the article provides commentary and structures to outline the impact of ExC and to elaborate the definition and reach of ExC. The logic of ExC culminates in a theory of cognitive states comprising of three potential decision states: endogenous cognition, symbiotic cognition and surrogate cognition. These states are posited as transient (consumers might move between them during a purchase episode) and determined by individual propensities and situational antecedents.

"Green consumption behavior is the embodiment of pro-environmental behavior, which is of great value to curb carbon emissions. However, the existing research on the model construction and quantitative analysis of the psychological process of green consumption behavior needs to be further explored. Therefore, on the basis of green consumption behavior and metacognitive theory, this study constructs a conceptual model of a psychological process with a psychological control source, green consumption attitude, three aspects of metacognition, and green consumption behavior and puts forward the hypothesis of an action mechanism. This study combines text mining technology and expert knowledge to establish a user review mining dictionary and mines the variables in the quantitative conceptual model through word embedding to test empirically the mechanism hypothesis. The results show that psychological control source has a significant impact on green consumption behavior, and green consumption attitude plays a partial mediating role between them. Metacognitive knowledge plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption behavior; metacognitive experience plays a moderating role between the psychological control source and green consumption attitude. Metacognitive monitoring plays a moderating role between green consumption attitude and green consumption behavior. In view of the above research results, we put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions: For organizations, it is necessary to identify green consumption groups, attach importance to green consumption experience, perform well in green marketing, and improve the competitiveness of green products; for decision makers, it is necessary to control strictly the industry standards of the green product market and perform well not only in the quality supervision of green products but also in the post-market construction of green products. © 2023 by the authors.",Chen J.; Liu Q.,Tactical,10.3390/su15108391,green consumption behavior; metacognitive theory; psychological control source; text mining technology,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The study constructs a conceptual model and hypotheses related to green consumption behavior, suggesting specific actions and strategies for organizations and decision-makers, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-big data,20,60,The Green Consumption Behavior Process Mechanism of New Energy Vehicles Driven by Big Data—From a Metacognitive Perspective,2023
"With the advancement of internet technology, customers increasingly rely on online reviews as a valuable source of information. The study aims to develop a marketing data analytics framework to manage online reviews, especially fake reviews, which have become a significant issue undermining the creditability of online review systems. As small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the capabilities to automatically derive customer insights from online reviews, this study proposes a cost-effective, extensible Review-Analytics-as-a-Service (RAaaS) framework that can be operated by non-data specialists to facilitate online review data analytics. We demonstrate the framework’s application by using two datasets with more than 400,000 online reviews from Yelp to simulate live platforms and demonstrate an analytic flow of review fraud detection and understanding. The findings reveal insights into the influence of fake reviews on product ranking and exposure rate. Moreover, it was found that there was a higher concentration of sadness and anger in fake reviews (vs. organic reviews). In addition, fake reviews tend to be shorter, more extreme (with the use of strong adverbs), and have different patterns of topic distribution.

"Purpose: Information on the impact of flooding is fundamental to mitigating flood risk in residential property. This paper aims to provide insight into the seller disclosure of flood risk and buyer behaviour in the absence of mandated seller disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a case study approach to critically evaluate the matrix of flood information available for buyers purchasing residential property in Brisbane, Queensland. This paper uses big data analytic techniques to extract and analyse internet data from online seller agents and buyer platforms to gain an understanding of buyer awareness and consideration of flood risk in the residential property market. Findings: Analysis of property marketing data demonstrates that seller agents voluntarily disclose flood impact only in periods where a flooding event is anticipated and is limited to asserting a property is free of flood risk. Analysis of buyer commentary demonstrates that buyers are either unaware of flood information or are discounting the risk of flood in favour of other property and locational attributes when selecting residential property. Practical implications: This research suggests that improved and accessible government-provided flood mapping tools are not enhancing buyers’ understanding and awareness of flood risk. Accordingly, it is recommended that mandatory disclosure be introduced in Queensland so that buyers are more able to manage risk and investment decisions before the purchase of residential property. Originality/value: This paper contributes to existing literature on raising community awareness and understanding of natural disaster risks and makes a further contribution in identifying mandatory disclosure as a mechanism to highlight the risk of flooding and inform residential property purchasers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Brown C.; Christensen S.; Blake A.; Indraswari K.; Wilson C.; Desouza K.,Strategic,10.1108/JPPEL-08-2022-0029,Community resilience; Consumer behaviour; Disaster management; Flood risk; Natural hazard,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The paper discusses the long-term implications of flood risk disclosure on buyer behavior and property market dynamics, suggesting mandatory disclosure as a strategic approach to manage risk in residential property purchases.",scopus-big data,60,20,"Is mandatory seller disclosure of flood risk necessary?

"This study considers the use of digitalization technologies in the management of marketing of a commercial company. As a result, the problem of bringing empirical knowledge about the importance of digitalization technologies in the company’s marketing management to a theoretical model has been solved. Digitalization technologies for implementation in marketing activities were selected and the decomposition of marketing management in a commercial company was performed. On this basis, a theoretical model for assessing the impact of digitalization technologies on the marketing management of a commercial company has been developed. The results of an empirical study based on the developed theoretical model proved the truth of the hypothesis about the positive impact of the spread of the use of digitalization technologies on the marketing management components of commercial companies. The choice of specific digitalization technologies is explained by the essence of marketing as a management activity. Structural decomposition of the marketing management process is explained by traditional management functions and clarifies the criteria for choosing technologies. The results of calculations according to the formed theoretical model are explained by the development of the platform economy and ecosystems, which involve the studied big data technologies, cloud computing and social media, as well as blockchain. The methodical approach to substantiating the role of digitalization technologies proposed in this study is characterized by the use of fundamental provisions on cybernetic systems, management theory, and modern marketing concepts.

"At present, the focus of marketing research is mostly on the influencing factors, composition, and measurement of brand equity. The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components.

"Under the pressure of surging advertising costs and fierce market competition, a growing number of online merchants are trying to implement new advertising strategies to improve advertising efficiency and increase sales. In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Hu L.; Sun X.; Yu H.; Chung S.H.,Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2022.3169392,E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract discusses specific advertising strategies (MA and TA) that merchants use to improve advertising efficiency and sales, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable plans.",scopus-big data,10,70,Seize the Opportunity of Targeted Marketing under the Platform Membership Mechanism,2024
"The recent rise of big data analytics is transforming the apparel retailing industry. E-retailers, for example, effectively use large volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business operations data to aid operations and supply chain management. Although logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions, leaving it an under-researched area of study. Adding to this research stream by exploring the case of a U.K.-based fast-fashion retailer, this article reveals unique consumer segments and links them to the revenue they are capable of generating. Applying the partitioning around medoids algorithm to three random samples of 10 000 unique consumer visits to the e-commerce site of a fast-fashion retailer, six consumer segments are identified. This article shows that although the 'mobile window shoppers' segment consists of the largest consumer segment, it attracts the lowest revenue. In contrast, 'visitors with a purpose,' although one of the smallest segments, generates the highest revenue. The findings of this article contribute to marketing research and inform practice, which can use these insights to target customer segments in a more tailored fashion.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Zavali M.; Lacka E.; De Smedt J.,Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2021.3070069,Apparel retailing; big data; clickstream data; consumer segmentation; online purchase,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract focuses on analyzing consumer segments based on clickstream data to inform marketing decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing analytics and customer targeting strategies.",scopus-big data,10,70,Shopping Hard or Hardly Shopping: Revealing Consumer Segments Using Clickstream Data,2023
"Big data analytics (BDA) is widely used in sales, marketing, distribution, and finance; however, its implementation in supply chain management, specifically in purchasing and supply management (PSM), has been slow and uneven. This study investigates the impact of BDA on strategic PSM decisions and how it interacts with a company's absorptive capacity. We conducted a survey of 222 purchasing and supply chain managers in international companies across various industries. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the exploration, assimilation, and transformation capabilities of purchasing departments are crucial in facilitating the use of BDA for strategic decision-making in PSM. Companies that excel in BDA in the PSM space are better equipped to capitalize on new and existing knowledge sources, which improves their performance. However, only businesses with the right resources can fully leverage BDA for high-level strategic decision-making; when BDA is applied to operational PSM activities, the desired effects may not be achieved. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Patrucco A.S.; Marzi G.; Trabucchi D.,Strategic,10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102814,Absorptive capacity; Big data analytics; Knowledge management; Purchasing management; Supply chain management,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the impact of big data analytics on strategic purchasing and supply management decisions, indicating a focus on long-term goals and the interaction with absorptive capacity within organizations.",scopus-big data,70,20,The role of absorptive capacity and big data analytics in strategic purchasing and supply chain management decisions,2023
"Purpose: This study aims to provide more insight into how customer voice is captured and used in managerial decision-making at the marketing-finance interface. This study’s focus is on understanding how the customer voice, often communicated through online and social media platforms, is used in high-performing hotels. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a case study of four high-performing Irish hotels. For each case, multiple informants, including marketing managers, general managers and finance managers, were interviewed and shadowed. Twenty seven decisions across the four cases were analysed to assess the use of customer voice in managerial decision-making. Findings: Social media provides a stage that has empowered the customer voice because of the public nature of the interaction and the network effect. Customer voice is incorporated in managerial decision-making in three distinct ways – symbolically as part of an early warning system, for action-oriented operational decisions and to some extent in the knowledge-enhancing role for tactical decisions. While there is a greater appreciation among senior managers and the finance and accounting managers of the importance of customer voice, this study finds clear limits in its utilisation and more reliance on traditional finance and accounting data, especially in strategic decision-making. Research limitations/implications: The cases belong to a highly visible open environment of hotels in an industry where customer voice has immediate and strong effects. The findings may not directly apply to industries characterised by a relatively more closed context such as banking or insurance. Moreover, the findings reflect the practices of high-performing hotels and do not necessarily capture the practices used in less successfully operating hotels. Practical implications: While marketers need to enhance their ability to create a narrative that links the customer voice to revenue generation, finance managers also need to develop a skillset and adopt a mindset that appropriately reflects the influential role for customer voice in managerial decision-making. Originality/value: Despite the linkage of marketing performance to business performance, there is limited research on the impact of customer information on managerial decision-making. This research provides insight into how customer voice is considered at the critical marketing-finance interface. © 2022, Deepak Saxena, Mairead Brady, Markus Lamest and Martin Fellenz.",Saxena D.; Brady M.; Lamest M.; Fellenz M.,Tactical,10.1108/QMR-09-2020-0113,Big data; Customer voice; Managerial decision-making; Marketing-finance interface; Service decisions; Social media,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses how customer voice is incorporated into managerial decision-making, particularly in operational decisions and tactical aspects like knowledge enhancement.

"Product service bundle (PSB) is a marketing strategy that offers attractive product-service packages with competitive pricing to ensure sustained profitability. However, designing suitable pricing for PSB is a non-trivial task that involves complex decision-making. This paper explores the significance of pricing optimization in the telecommunication industry, focusing on product-service bundling (PSB). It delves into the challenges associated with pricing PSB and highlights the transformative impact of big data analytics on decision-making for PSB strategies. The study presents a data-driven pricing optimization model tailored for designing appropriate pricing structures for product-service bundles within the telecommunication services domain. This model integrates customer preference knowledge and involves intricate decision-making processes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the paper conducts a case study encompassing two design scenarios, wherein the results reveal that the model offers competitive pricing compared to existing telecommunication service providers, facilitating PSB design and decision-making. The findings from the case study indicate that the data-driven pricing optimization model can significantly aid PSB design and decision-making, leading to competitive pricing strategies that open avenues for new market exploration and ensure business sustainability. By considering both product and service features concurrently, the proposed model provides a pricing reference for optimal decision-making. The case study validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach within the telecommunication industry and highlights its potential for broader applications. The model's capability to generate competitive pricing strategies offers opportunities for new market exploration, ensuring business growth and adaptability. © 2024 The Author(s)",Zakaria A.F.; Lim S.C.J.; Aamir M.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jjimei.2024.100212,Bundle pricing; Pricing decision; Product service bundle; PSB; Service design,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a data-driven pricing optimization model for product-service bundles in the telecommunication industry, focusing on long-term competitive pricing strategies and decision-making processes that align with strategic goals.",scopus-big data,60,30,A pricing optimization modelling for assisted decision making in telecommunication product-service bundling,2024
"Business resources and processes such as Big Data Marketing Analytics (BDMA) are becoming increasingly focused on meeting the needs and objectives of customers. Consequently, this research aims to use PLS-SEM to explain the interaction and relationships between the core user-centric performance measures of BDMA, such as user satisfaction, value for money and reinvestment intention. Also, the significance of the decision-making role was explored in this context. Finally, the impact of perceived financial performance was investigated to see its impact on the examined relationships. The impact of value for money on user satisfaction, the impact of the decision-making role on user satisfaction, and finally, the impact of the decision-making role on the reinvestment intentions were found to be significant for individuals who scored either low or high perceived financial performance. Furthermore, all the observed relationships in the dataset were positive, whereas only three were positive and significant for individuals who scored low on perceived financial performance. Overall, it is clear that perceived financial performance has a vital role in BDMA deployment, where understanding the influence of user authority in decision-making enables managers to design better organizational plans by integrating inputs from multiple organizational cross-layers. Also, the results indicate that a user’s decision-making role influences user-centric measures in BDMA deployment, which reveals how user perceptions and authority play a vital role in the context of BDMA in firms. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Haverila K.; Haverila M.; Rangarajan A.,Strategic,10.1080/10696679.2024.2305445,,5.0,,10,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of BDMA on user satisfaction and decision-making roles, indicating a focus on strategic planning within organizations to improve customer-centric outcomes.",scopus-big data,60,25,"The impact of the decision-making role on perceived satisfaction, value for money, and reinvest intentions at varying levels of perceived financial performance in the context of Big Data Marketing Analytics",2024
"Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance. © 2016 University of Minnesota.

"Although the existing literature has acknowledged the importance of mobile marketing, few scholars have examined the efficacy of mobile targeting. This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile targeting by investigating the effects of customer mobile habits and social capital on firm sales. Leveraging unique customer mobile browsing data from a major telecom service provider in China, we use a Bayesian SEM (structural equation modeling) approach to show that customer mobile habits and social capital exert significant influences on customers' purchase intentions. Specifically, customers who engage in more hedonic mobile behaviors, such as social networking, video browsing, and gaming are associated with a higher probability of purchasing, controlling for the usage of communications apps including messaging and emailing apps, and the usage of functional apps, such as maps, living services, and app market apps. Additionally, our research results reveal a significant positive effect of social capital on firms' sales performance. These findings offer important insights that are often missing from organizational targeting campaign designs in terms of targeting both the right customers and the right business alliance partners and enable a better understanding of managerial and decision-making implications in the context of the B2B market in general. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Feng X.; Li Y.; Lin X.; Ning Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.06.007,Bayesian SEM; Big data; Hedonic value; Mobile habits; Mobile targeting; Social capital,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the effects of customer mobile habits and social capital on firm sales, which involves interpreting strategic goals into targets for marketing campaigns.

"While marketing analytics plays an important role in generating insights from big data to improve marketing decision-making and firm competitiveness, few academic studies have investigated the mechanisms through which it can be used to achieve sustained competitive advantage. To close this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capability view to posit that a firm can attain sustained competitive advantage from its sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities, which are manifested by the use of marketing analytics, marketing decision-making, and product development management. This study also examines the impact of the antecedents of marketing analytics use on marketing related processes. The analysis of a survey of 221 UK firm managers demonstrates: (a) the positive impact of marketing analytics use on both marketing decision-making and product development management; (b) the effect of the latter two on sustained competitive advantage; (c) the indirect effect of data availability on both marketing decision-making and production development management; and (d) the indirect effect of managerial support on marketing decision-making.

"Purpose - Big data produced by mobile apps contains valuable knowledge about customers and markets and have been viewed as productive resources. The purpose of this paper is to propose a multiple methods approach to elicit intelligence and value from big data by analysing the customer behaviour in mobile app usage. Design/methodology/approach - The big data analytical approach is developed using three data mining techniques: RFM(recency, frequency, monetary) analysis, link analysis, and association rule learning. The authors then conduct a case study to apply this approach to analyse the transaction data extracted from a mobile app. Findings - This approach can identify high value and mass customers, and understand their patterns and preferences in using the functions of the mobile app. Such knowledge enables the developer to capture the behaviour of large pools of customers and to improve products and services by mixing and matching the functions and offering personalised promotions and marketing information. Originality/value - The approach used in this study balances complexity with usability, thus facilitating corporate use of big data in making product improvement and customisation decisions. The approach allows developers to gain insights into customer behaviour and function usage preferences by analysing big data. The identified associations between functions can also help developers improve existing, and design new, products and services to satisfy customers' unfulfilled requirements. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.",Chen Q.; Zhang M.; Zhao X.,Tactical,10.1108/IMDS-04-2016-0141,Big data; Customer behaviour; Mobile app,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract describes a practical approach to analyzing customer behavior through specific data mining techniques, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Enabled by the big data driven user profiling and precision bidding techniques, online programmatic advertising markets have evolved from the traditional website-buying or ad-slot-buying models to a fine-grained and real-time trading model at the level of ad impressions (i.e., ad inventory). As a result, Web publishers are now facing a challenging decision of allocating the ad inventory across multiple advertising models, which has a direct and important influence on both their individual revenues, and the market-wide supply-demand balance. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF), taking into consideration the possible scenarios of ad inventory allocation in programmatic advertising markets. AIAF explicitly captures the specific features of ad inventory allocation in each of three levels (i.e., channel level, market level and platform level), and also their influence-feedback effects. We present the general solution process for solving this model on the basis of its property analysis. An illustrative instantiation of our AIAF model is formulated to demonstrate its applications in supporting publishers’ decision-making on the ad inventory allocation. We also conduct experiments based on empirical data so as to validate the model and analysis. Our research findings indicate that 1) our AIAF model outperforms other single-level and two-level allocation strategies; 2) the fine-grained optimization is superior to that of the coarse-grained level; 3) allocation decisions should be made on the basis of the comparative marginal revenue instead of the absolute marginal revenue. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Li J.; Ni X.; Yuan Y.; Wang F.-Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2018.09.001,Ad inventory; Header bidding; Private marketplace; Programmatic advertising; Real-time bidding,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF) that supports publishers' decision-making regarding ad inventory allocation, which is a tactical decision process that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.
