"Indonesia has witnessed extreme weather conditions in various regions in recent times. In the early 2013, these conditions have caused flood in Karawang district. This extremity in climate conditions indicates that climate change has occurred. Climate change, in the form of high/low rainfall, erratic rainfall or changes in the rainy/dry season, has become problem to paddy farmers of Karawang district, who have faced increase in post-harvest losses of paddy. Technological capability of farmers is one of the main factors that play important role in tackling such conditions. Measurement of post-harvest technological capabilities of paddy farmers in dealing with climate change is carried out using six criteria, such as the production capability, investment capability, capability to make small changes, capability to make major changes, marketing capability, and capability to create network. The methods used to measure the technological capabilities are the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Non-Numeric Multi Expert Multi Criteria Decision Making (MEMCDM). This paper studies the level of post-harvest technological capabilities of farmers in dealing with climate change and provides technology policy recommendation. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Anujuprana A.H.; Machfud; Sutrisno; Suryani A.,Not identified,10.1504/IJTPM.2014.060158,Climate change; Level of technological capabilities; Policy recommendation; Technological capability,15.0,,15,50,Inderscience Publishers,"The abstract discusses the impact of climate change on agricultural practices, specifically paddy farming in Indonesia, and focuses on measuring technological capabilities rather than marketing-related decisions.",scopus-recommendation,10,10,Model for measuring post-harvest technological capability of paddy farmers in dealing with climate change,2014
"Indecision is not the hallmark of a great manager, but what do we know about when and why managers avoid or postpone decisions? The purpose of this paper is to discuss the limited research on indecision. This article reviews research from judgment and decision making, psychology, management, and marketing literatures to assemble what we already know about indecision. The review spans situational and personal determinants of indecision, highlighting what we know about when and why people experience indecision as well as who is predictably indecisive. Decisions are avoided when people are asked to justify them, when options are similar in attractiveness, and when there are a large number of options to consider. Indecision may sometimes be a result of systematic biases (i.e. omission bias and status quo bias), and indecisive people may be more prone to confirmation bias. Finally, indecisiveness is related to numerous other individual differences, many of which are negative. Specific recommendations for managers include evaluating options separately rather than comparing options, structuring incentive systems to reward decisive action, and explicitly considering the risk of lost opportunity when deciding whether to put off making a decision. The literature reviewed in this paper spans diverse disciplines and perspectives. This paper provides a starting point for managers and researchers interested in understanding indecision: when and why it occurs, who is likely to be most indecisive, and what we might do to counter indecision. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Brooks M.E.,Tactical,10.1108/00251741111130788,Decision making; Leadership; Managers,5.0,,20,5,,"The abstract discusses indecision in management and provides recommendations for decision-making, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable steps.

"This study observes the potential decrease in air travel as a result of terrorist attacks in relation to individuals' sociodemographic variables and media usage. Drawing from a sample of 2,023 respondents in the 2008 General Social Survey data set, this study seeks to identify market segments that have been most significantly impacted by terrorism events since September 11, 2001. Data are analyzed through direct logistic regression, resulting in a statistically significant model, χ2 (10, N = 685) = 25.40, p = 0.005. Results show two significant predictors of a terrorist-based decision to reduce air travel: occupational prestige and gender. Conclusions reveal the sociodemographic profile defining the market segment that has reduced air travel because of terrorist activity. Finally, recommendations are provided for enhancing and delivering marketing advertisements to this market segment. © 2011 Cognizant Comm.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the use of online recommendation systems on e-commerce sites is which becoming more common as marketers recognize their potential to improve their own operations as well as consumers' shopping experiences. Since some consumers question the credibility of these systems, this study compares responses to such systems (classified based on their source into seller and third party systems) with responses to recommendations coming directly from other consumers. The latter may also be better suited for consumers today since many of them utilize direct information from social media on a daily basis. Past research indicates that reactions to such recommendations may depend on the types of goods they describe and therefore this study also tests whether consumer responses vary with types of goods. The study examines consumer reactions to recommendations designed for search, experience, and credence goods. Finally, this study also explores the most desired features of recommendations to help marketers come up with the most effective recommendations that help facilitate purchasing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The study surveys a convenience sample of 202 undergraduate students to test these objectives. It was a 3 (product types) by 3 (recommendation types) factorial design with multiple dependent variables and three covariates. Findings: The study reveals that, irrespective of the product type, consumers react differently to the three types of recommendations that are tested. This study shows that consumers have the most positive attitudes and most frequently utilize recommendations coming directly from other consumer. This suggests that more attention should be directed to these recommendations in marketing theory and practice. Consumers also hold more positive attitudes towards third-party recommendation systems than recommendation systems coming from the seller. They also have more positive reactions toward recommendations designed for search and experience goods rather than credence products. Finally, the study also examines the usefulness of different characteristics of these recommendations to help online managers develop most effective recommendations online and finds that it varies with different types of recommendations and products for which recommendations are used. Originality/value: In addition to the recommendation systems that have been explored in the past (seller and third party systems), the study examines reactions to recommendations coming directly from other consumers, as these recommendations may be better suited for today's audiences. The study shows which recommendation type is best received and most frequently used online. It also tests reactions to recommendations designed for different types of goods. This study includes credence goods, in addition to search and experience products, since consumer reactions to recommendations designed for credence goods have not been yet explored in the past research. It also found that recommendations are better received for goods with a higher number of search features. Finally, the study explores the specific features of different recommendation types and based on the findings proposes how these online recommendations should be structured to be most effective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Lepkowska-White E.,Tactical,10.1108/JRIM-07-2012-0027,Advertising; Internet advertising; Internet marketing; Marketing communication; Online shopping; Young consumers,10.0,,20,0,,"The study focuses on the comparison of different types of online recommendation systems and consumer reactions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, specifically in campaign optimization and consumer engagement strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,60,Are they listening?

"Managers are eager to know whether they should use gender-specific strategies to communicate with male and female consumers differently to recommendation services in Internet-based selling, as both groups are worthwhile and profitable to target. This issue has been overlooked in the literature, despite its importance and the fact that recommendations have become a major online advertising tactic in recent years. This study is diverse from existing studies in three ways: testing recommendation agent acceptance in the information context, revealing gender effects and applying a new lens of cognition-conation. By proposing a theoretical model based on the advertising hierarchy of effects model, this study investigated consumers' elaboration processes towards recommendation agent advices. Based on 432 members randomly selected from a database of a well-known Internet-based sellers, the study finds that women consider perceived usefulness of recommendation agent advices to a greater extent than men while making decisions about the usefulness of recommendations. Further, consumers' perceived usefulness is more strongly influenced by their perceived shopping task uncertainty than by involvement, while more-involved consumers have lower levels of perceive shopping task uncertainty. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Based on a realist conceptualization of interests, this paper explores how commercial and scientific priorities appear to have converged and diverged during the development of the antidepressant Zelmid. The drug represents the first of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to reach the market. Zelmid was synthesized in 1971 and launched by the Swedish firm Astra in 1982, but subsequently withdrawn the next year because of adverse neurological effects. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with scientists representing both industry and academia who had high-level involvement in various phases of the project (experimental, pre-clinical and clinical), as well as on textual sources such as scientific articles and memoirs. Zelmid was a product of mechanism-based or ""rational"" drug discovery from the early 1960s and the associated intermingling of science and commerce. It is argued that both scientists and the pharmaceutical company shared an interest in embracing mechanism-based drug discovery because it simultaneously promised medico-scientific advances and profits. However, the intermingling of science and commerce also strained the relationship between scientific and commercial priorities further along the trajectory of the drug; for example, concerning issues such as dosage strategy and drug use in primary care, where corporate management allegedly took decisions contrary to the recommendations of both academic and company scientists. On such occasions the asymmetry in power became apparent in scientists' narratives: commercial considerations trumped those of science since, ultimately, decisions rest with management, not with scientists. In addition, temporality appears to be associated with the divergence of commercial and scientific priorities. While rare during experimental and pre-clinical phases, divergence was concentrated downstream to the clinical testing and post-marketing phases. It is hypothesized that a similar pattern of convergence and divergence of commercial and scientific priorities may exist in the trajectory of other drugs. © 2015 The Author.",Mulinari S.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.06.020,Antidepressant; Drug development; History; Interests; Pharmaceutical industry; Psychiatry; SSRI; Sweden,0.0,,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The content of the abstract focuses on the development of a pharmaceutical drug and the interplay between scientific and commercial interests, which does not relate to marketing applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,"Divergence and convergence of commercial and scientific priorities in drug development: The case of Zelmid, the first SSRI antidepressant",2015
"Tne purpose of this paper is to examine the nine-buying decision-making process of U.S. Generation Y purchasers, when they select European wines. This is one of few empirical studies of U.S. Generation Ywine consumers and their nine purchasing decisions. Using the Howard Model of Consumer Decision Making, the researchers analyzed the significant factors Generation Y purchasers use as they make decisions about wine purchases. Generation Y respondents across the United States who were of legal drinking age were surveyed. In total 713 usable surveys were obtained. Tne researchers found that when Generation Y purchasers consider European Mines, the variables of consumer experience and brand familiarity are significant to the decision process. In addition, the consumer search process helps to build brand familiarity. In turn, brand familiarity improves the consumer attitude which contributes to the intent to purchase wine. Tne results provide valuable information about Generation Y Mine purchasers and it is to these individuals the global wine industry is looking for market growth. European wineries and their associations can use this information to improve their promotional activities and better educate Generation Ypurchasers about their products as they develop marketing programs and positioning strategies Mithin the U.S. Wineries can also target other upon whom Generation Y purchasers rely for recommendations. This information will enable wineries to use their marketing funds more efficiently.",Geringer S.D.; Patterson D.M.; Forsythe L.M.,Tactical,,,5.0,,15,0,Allied Academies,The abstract outlines specific factors influencing Generation Y's wine purchasing decisions and suggests actionable strategies for wineries and associations to improve their marketing efforts.

"Today's information-intensive economy places increased importance on high-technology products, and this is shown in high-tech firms' increasingly expanded role in the global economy. Markets of high-technology products are characterized by a combination of the specific attributes. As a result of these characteristics, marketing management should be adapted to effectively handle the complicated environment in which customer decisions, and the firm's marketing decisions are made. Especially marketing must be effectively integrated with other managerial areas. In this context the paper focuses on the value of being market-oriented in high-tech markets.

"If marketers wish to communicate the positive characteristics of purchasing the private hospital experience, the marketers need to be able to identify which of the participants in the purchasing process is acting in the role of decision maker. Research was undertaken of doctors in the rural setting. Potential respondents were selected from Orange to Broken Hill; from Coonabarabran to Young. Two private hospitals are known to be located within this region - one in Orange and one in Dubbo. In most cases, patients in the rural setting are having the final say as to which hospital to attend. They are filling the role of decision maker. The factors that potential patients are considering in their decision include the services provided by the hospital - specifically factors relating to accommodation, services and cost. These observations are those as interpreted by the doctors who see these patients. Based on the findings of the survey a number of recommendations have been made: (1) Any marketing communication by hospitals should target primarily patients and then doctors. (2) Further research should be undertaken to attempt to accurately determine what characteristics are considered when patients and doctors refer to hospital services. (3) Research should be undertaken to determine the identity of all parties involved in the purchasing decision process. (4) Further research should be undertaken of the general population to determine what factors relating to a hospital are considered when making the hospital purchasing decision. (5) Further in depth analysis should be conducted with the raw data.",Sloane G.; Tidwell P.; Horsfield M.,Tactical,10.1300/J043v13n01_04,,0.0,,15,5,,"The abstract focuses on specific marketing strategies and recommendations to effectively communicate with potential patients and doctors in the context of private hospital services.

"Purpose This research is a qualitative study which aims to investigate the intricacies of organisational buying behaviour in the context of the Irish biotechnology industry. Particularly the research seeks to focus on the phenomenon of buying centres as the core decision-making unit in an organisation and examines the functionality of such a process. The main aims of the research study is to examine key influencers, as well as to examine the decision process itself so as to fully comprehend modern organisational buyer behaviour and to discuss these issues from a practical viewpoint beneficial to both the marketing and purchasing functions. Design/methodology/approach The research process was conducted through qualitative methods, which formed a combination of focus group and key respondent interviewing. A triangular approach of data was also used to obtain quality information and to achieve a platform upon which to base accurate conclusions. A small number of organisations from industry participated in this study, which was deemed sufficient as the purpose of the study was gaining insight as opposed to proving or disproving previous theories. Findings It was discovered that users were key influencers in the decision process as were quality control personnel. In addition the business functions were found to be the decision makers in a highly dynamic buying centre process, which is constantly changing in terms of numbers, participation, and structure. Based on the finding of the research newer models of organisation buying behaviour were developed in addition to appropriate marketing strategies being put forward in order to better represent the realities of modern business-to-business marketing. This is where the real benefits of this research will be seen as marketing organisations become more efficient, buying organisations develop best practice procedures, and academics can build on this research base to further enhance marketing knowledge.

"This research examines the influence of recommendations on consumer decision making during online shopping experiences. Evidence from two empirical studies suggests that many online consumers seek and accept recommendations in order to effectively manage the amount of information available during online search processes. These findings suggest that consumers use the mere availability of peer recommendations as a decision-making heuristic, irrespective of the peer recommender's personal characteristics. Findings also suggest that consumer preference for peer versus editorial recommendations depends on the specific nature of the consumer's shopping goal: utilitarian or hedonic Finally, results from this study indicate that consumers prefer peer and editorial recommendations over other types of effort-reducing cues that might be available during online search. As such, retailers must consider a number of factors including recommender characteristics, shopping goals, and product characteristics in their bid to provide consumers with the appropriate type of recommendation for their respective decision-making task. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.",Smith D.; Menon S.; Sivakumar K.,Operational,10.1002/dir.20041,,5.0,,65,5,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses consumer decision-making and the use of recommendations during online shopping, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer preferences and choices.

"Improving marketing decision making requires a better understanding of the factors that influence how managers interpret and respond to a market situation. Building on extant literature, the authors develop a model that delineates antecedents of and responses to the interpretation of a market situation. Using case-scenario methodology, the authors test the model in the context of a marketing decision (annual advertising and promotion budget recommendation) with data collected from a nationwide sample of hospital marketing executives. The results of the partial least squares analysis show that (1) cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use affect the extent to which managers perceive a given market situation as one in which they can control the outcomes of their decision; (2) the more managers perceive a situation as controllable, the more they appraise that situation as an opportunity; and (3) the more managers appraise a situation as an opportunity, the greater is the magnitude of their response.",White J.C.; Varadarajan P.R.; Dacin P.A.,Tactical,10.1509/jmkg.67.3.63.18654,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract focuses on understanding and improving marketing decision-making processes, specifically regarding how managers interpret market situations and make recommendations for advertising and promotion budgets, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,"Market situation interpretation and response: The role of cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use",2003
"With the growing competition and complexity of marketing information,interpersonal communication is becoming increasingly important to marketers and consumers (mavens) who can act as disseminators of marketing communications and play an important role. Previous research, which has found that mavens are more likely to be female, has ignored the way in which these consumer communicators make decisions and process information. As male product markets grow and gender roles in shopping become blurred, identifying male mavens could be a useful promotional tool. Sixty male and 78 female market mavens were identified from a survey of 455 German consumers, which differed only marginally in terms of age and education. The prime decision-making traits of male mavens differed from females and were related to brand consciousness, shopping avoidance/satisficing, impulsiveness, speedy fashion seeking, perfectionism, price–value consciousness, confused by overchoice and quality brand loyal. Implications and recommendations for marketers targeting male product markets in Germany are discussed. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Wiedmann K.-P.; Walsh G.; Mitchell V.-W.,Tactical,10.1080/13527260127413,Gender Differences In Decision Making; Male Market Mavens; Word-OF-MOUTH Communication,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the identification of male and female market mavens and their decision-making traits, which can be utilized as a tactical approach for marketers targeting specific demographics in male product markets.

"Despite growing concerns about the quality and accuracy of Internet-based prescription drug information, there has been very little empirical research on consumers' perceptions of the trustworthiness of on-line drug information. In this article, we report on a study modeled after that of Menon, Deshpande, Perri, and Zinkhan (2002) in Health Marketing Quarterly that reexamines how key demographic, predispositional, and media factors are associated with consumer trust in on-line prescription drug information and the impact of trust in on-line drug information on ad-promoted behavior following exposure to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. Four major findings are reported: (1) on-line drug information is not highly trusted; (2) trust in on-line drug information is not differentially affected by consumer demographic or predispositional characteristics; (3) trust in the traditional media of DTC advertising is predictive of trust in on-line drug information; and (4) trust in on-line drug information is associated directly with specific types of ad-promoted behavior following exposure to DTC advertising.

"Procter & Gamble (P&G) Asia-Pacific is interested in managing value growth. Only after fully understanding the true effects of the marketing-mix variables can P&G managers make strategic decisions answering questions such as the following: (1) Are the P&G brands in the detergent market inelastic or elastic with respect to price? How has the price elasticity changed over time? Can P&G increase the price of its brands to gain value growth? (2) What are the price, distribution, and sizing combinations needed to achieve the desirable value growth? (3) How can P&G gain market share from its competitors without cannibalizing its own brands? P&G Asia-Pacific approached us to develop a value growth framework to answer these questions. To generate the answers for the above questions, we develop a three-step weighted random coefficient estimator that captures the heterogeneity across cross sections (different stock-keeping units and states) and the endogeneity of distribution. Based on the parameter estimates, we provide strategic recommendations to P&G for a field test to validate our suggestions. We developed a simulator for P&G managers so that they can generate appropriate marketing-mix strategies for achieving the desired value growth. As a result, P&G gained over $39 million in value growth over a one-year period by implementing the recommendations from our modeling approach. © 2009 INFORMS.",Kumar V.; Fan J.; Gulati R.; Venkat P.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1080.0477,Distribution; Marketing mix; Price elasticity; Random coefficient model; Revenue; Sales value; Sales volume; System of equations,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to value growth and strategic decisions based on the marketing-mix variables, which aligns with defining the goals and nature of the organization.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,Marketing-mix recommendations to manage value growth at P&G Asia-Pacific,2009
"Electronic commerce (EC) is an important issue both for research and in the real business world. In addition, the Internet is a new and rapidly growing marketing channel for companies developing B2B (Business to Business) or B2C (Business to Customers) electronic commerce. To obtain rewards from EC, dot-com companies should develop their marketing performance effectively to attract customers' attention toward purchasing goods and to provide satisfying service for customers on the Internet. But not all the dot-com companies are successful, many factors will affect the enterprise operation. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to establish a multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) framework for assessing and evaluating the marketing performance of Internet bookstore companies in Taiwan. Based on the hierarchical structure, a mixed MADM method with non-additive and additive fuzzy measurement is used to show the relative importance of quality attributes.

"Purpose - The paper seeks to discuss and analyse the nature of place umbrella brands and the role such brands play in promotion of a country, a region, or a city. The purpose is also to identify some salient success criteria of provenance associations as core values of place umbrella brands. Design/methodology/approach - The study delineates a conceptual framework, which illustrates important components in place umbrella branding. It also highlights a set of criteria to aid prioritisations among prospective provenance associations that have a potential to be used as brand values of place umbrella brands. Practical implications - The paper identifies some characteristics of provenance associations, which make them more transferable across a bundle of umbrella brand partners. The generation of better marketing theory in the field of place branding will make it easier for practitioners to reach the right decisions in choice of provenance associations. Findings - It is claimed that transcendence is related to the transferability of provenance associations across a bundle of brands. Because transferability strongly depends on perceptions of similarity, the starting point is to identify matches between the partner brands based on their shared provenance. Originality/value - The article ends with a recommendation that researchers in place branding should carefully analyze provenance associations according to the suggested criteria. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Iversen N.M.; Hem L.E.,Strategic,10.1108/03090560810862534,Brand image; Brand management; Brands,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the nature of place umbrella brands and their role in promoting regions or countries, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic branding concepts.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent of use of the price-quality cue in financial services, and to uncover some of its drivers. The drives studied are: advertising exposure, product complexity, and consumer price knowledge. The use of price as an indicator of quality has been a well-documented phenomenon in consumer goods markets. However, the existence of this relationship has not been tested in services, and in particular in financial services markets. Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey of over 200 individuals contacted through intercept interviews was conducted. The use of the price-quality cue and its drivers were measured using multi-item scales, for six financial services categories: checking accounts, financial advisory services, automobile insurance, home insurance, life insurance, and tax accounting. Findings - Significant variations in the use of price as an indicator of quality across financial services categories are identified. Furthermore, it is found that both consumer price knowledge and advertising exposure increase the use of the price-quality cue, while product complexity was found to have no significant impact on price-quality cue utilization for financial services. Research limitations/implications - Future research could expand the array of variables which drive consumers' use of the price-quality cue. In addition, a wider range of financial services categories could be studied. Practical implications - Knowing the extent by which consumers depend on the price-quality cue in their decisions is critical to optimal positioning of a financial brand. This paper provides specific managerial recommendations on how to approach the pricing and marketing of each of the six financial services categories studied. In addition public policymakers may find the findings of interest due to quality perception biases that may result from financial services providers' pricing tactics Originality/value - While previous research studies in price-quality cue utilization have primarily focused on manufactured goods, this paper is the only study that has examined the dynamics of price-quality cue utilization by consumers in financial services. This is an important inquiry due to the large volume of consumer expenditures in financial services categories, and the significant impact that these categories have on the financial stability and well-being of the public.",Estelami H.,Strategic,10.1108/10610420810875115,Customer relations; Customer service management; Financial services; Pricing; Quality,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the use of the price-quality cue in financial services and its implications for marketing strategies, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making processes.",scopus-recommendation,50,30,Consumer use of the price-quality cue in financial services,2008
"Managers in the travel industry are keen to know what influences customer decision-making and how customers make their decisions. Travel motivation reflects one's needs and wants and can be viewed as a critical variable in relation to their purchase decisions. Travel motives for joining group travel may be different from those of free independent travelers. This study examined travel motives as well as travel decision-making of Taiwanese travellers with a group package tour abroad. The qualitative approach - participant observation first and telephone interviews with tour participants later - was conducted for data collection. It was found that socio-psychological needs were an important motivation for travel, and socio-economic considerations were regarded as a crucial motivation for travel decision-making. Furthermore, their decision-makings are also strongly influenced by their social relationships - friends/relatives' recommendations. The results also revealed that Taiwanese travelers' travel motivations are considerably related to the price paid. The 'push factor' appeared to have much more impact than the 'pull factor' for impelling Taiwanese travelers in the pursuit of a holiday. Since the source of information for taking a vacation plays an important role for decision-making, this research suggested that the travel agency should put more efforts on nurturing a positive corporate image in order to gain consumers' trust.

"County Community Bank (CCB), the largest community bank in the state of Mississippi, built its success in the regional business market through relationship marketing and a high-touch approach. However, by the mid-1990s, CCB management began to believe that its image as ""a small town bank"" would be detrimental to future success. To be better aligned with new national competition, an image change was undertaken whereby the bank shifted its competitive advantage to include the area of technology, eventually becoming one of the most technologically aggressive banks in the state, and even the region. Had CCB become too product-driven in its business-to-business marketing decisions, or were they still customer-driven? Had the changes resulted in the intended outcomes? Consequently, CCB commissioned a market research study in which current business customers were surveyed. The results of this study are presented.

"The research findings of Millennials to Matures were applied to four generational groups. As the feedback shows, the groups' purchasing-decision drivers differ. Price is the primary driver for Millennials, who regard themselves as poor. And because this group often has an inherent mistrust of corporations and is always 'plugged-in.' Millennials are highly reliant on friends' recommendations and digital media. GenXers also more likely to go to a company website or a product category URL to learn more.

"How should a retailer think about the decision to carry, price, and promote products that overlap with another store when such overlap is predicted to intensify price competition and drive down product prices? The existing research suggests that retailers should look to carry an ever-increasing percentage of unique or non-overlapping products [J. Marketing 61 (1997) 38; Marketing Sci. 19 (2000) 83], thereby eliminating the ability to compare prices across stores.We challenge this recommendation, arguing that overlapping products allow one type of retailer-the higher end retailer-to signal the fairness of its prices and foster a more favorable price image than might otherwise exist. In a laboratory study, we show that, for higher end stores, the existence of overlapping products can significantly increase perceptions of pricing fairness and subsequent store choice, even when those overlapping products are no cheaper in the focal store than in a competing store. © 2004 New York University.

"Many firms use decision tools called “automatic recommendation systems” that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark models.

"Purpose: The main purpose of this study is threefold: to analyze the current conditions of higher education services offered in the three target markets; to conduct market segmentation analysis of these markets; and to recommend the most appropriate market entry strategies for Hong Kong's education service providers. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this project were obtained primarily by questionnaire survey and interviews. The research team collected 1,370 questionnaires and conducted a total of 121 individual and focus group interviews in the four studied cities - Mumbai, New Delhi, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur. Findings: The study found that there was a high unmet demand for higher education overseas and that the visibility of Hong Kong's higher education was relatively weak in these Asian markets. In order to capture the continued rise of students in Asia, higher education institutions and the Hong Kong government need to work together to analyze the potential markets critically and employ marketing strategies sensibly.

The study was carried out by collecting a primary data from interviewing group committees and group members. The secondary data were also collected from various documents. The study found that there are four internal factors: local wisdom, knowledge management, group management, marketing, and three external factors: community contexts, network, and government policies that has influence on self-reliance of the group. Besides, the group could be self-reliant by having five components: appropriate technology, circulated capital, sufficient raw materials in the locality, enthusiastic group leaders, and helpful group members.

"Purpose: Banking in Ghana is now an intensely competitive proposition. In a competitive environment, it becomes imperative not just to attract customers, but also to design strategies aimed at maintaining these customers. Drawing on data from over 2,000 retail bank customers in Ghana, this study aims at understanding the key motivations for maintaining accounts with banks in respect of Ghanaian bank customers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from customers of 22 retail banks in Ghana. A two-stage sampling technique was adopted in obtaining the sample. First, for each of the banks, two branches were randomly selected from the list of all functionally operating branches. In the second stage, customers of the selected branches were randomly intercepted in the banking halls and the survey instrument administered to them. A total of 2,000 respondents were attracted. Logistic regression modelling was employed in analysing the data. Findings: Overall bank customers view proximity/accessibility as the most important factor in the opening and maintenance of accounts with banks in Ghana. Recommendations by friends appear to be the least important factor in Ghanaian bank consumers' decision to open and maintain a bank account in Ghana. The findings were strange to the extent that word-of-mouth marketing has been lauded as one of the most potent marketing communications tools in services marketing but the empirical findings from the study did not support this. Practical implications: To the extent that proximity is a key factor in the opening and maintenance of bank relationships in Ghana, distribution management must be given a more strategic imperative in bank management in Ghana. Bank branches must be sited in catchment areas with the highest propensity to attract and maintain an existing profitable bank clientele. Originality/value: The study is one of the few on bank marketing in Ghana that draws on a large bank consumer data set and utilizes robust statistical analysis to reach its conclusions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Hinson R.; Owusu-Frimpong N.; Dasah J.,Strategic,10.1108/02652320910979898,Banking; Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Ghana,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the competitive landscape of banking in Ghana and emphasizes the importance of strategic decisions such as branch location to attract and maintain customers.

"Genetic testing is currently subject to little oversight, despite the significant ethical issues involved. Repeated recommendations for increased regulation of the genetic testing market have led to little progress in the policy arena. A 2005 Internet search identified 13 websites offering health-related genetic testing for direct purchase by the consumer. Further examination of these sites showed that overall, biotech companies are not providing enough information for consumers to make well-informed decisions; they are not consistently offering genetic counseling services; and some sites even offer tests with little evidence of clinical value. This article aims to raise company and consumer awareness about the ethical concerns surrounding the direct-to-consumer marketing of health-related genetic tests.

"Forest management in Central and Eastern Europe, under direct or indirect Soviet influence, for a long time followed different management objectives and strategies as compared to the forest management in countries with market economies in Western Europe located in the same biogeographic zones. In the light of the appearing paradigms of natural disturbance regimes and ecosystem-based forest management we evaluate forest management in the former Soviet Union and Sweden with respect to conservation of riparian forest ecotones. We studied the site and forest age class distribution both along watercourses and at randomly selected locations in the surrounding terrain in managed landscapes in Sweden and the former Soviet Union, respectively. Along watercourses in the former Soviet Union 20% of the overall forest cover was classified as old-growth compared with 6% in the surrounding landscape. By contrast, although the proportion of site type distribution was similar, such forests were neither found along watercourses nor in the surrounding landscape in Sweden. The results hence show that the Soviet management policy resulted in better conditions from the biodiversity conservation perspective. We conclude that the forestry decision-making environment does matter for practical forest conservation. We also make the following recommendations to forest and environmental planners and decision-makers: (1) protect existing and restore and re-create riparian corridors in general; (2) maintain riparian forests along streams of all orders, because small rivers are as important for conservation of biodiversity as large rivers; (3) designate riparian corridors for protection not focusing on a single width, but rather based on vegetation site type appropriate for stand types with a continuous forest cover. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A qualitative study was launched with the aim to assess the community's perception concerning CCS and whether this service is able to fulfil the needs and wants of the community with a view of development of guidelines for a consumer-based marketing strategy. A schedule covering the seven critical areas of decision-making in a marketing strategy had been developed and utilised as a data collection instrument to collect data from respondents, who have all been beneficiaries in one way or another of this service. It was found that a strategic planning process should be implemented in order to obtain clarity regarding the vision and mission of the organization; a marketing plan (which includes the strategic analysis, the SWOT analysis, marketing objectives and marketing strategy) should be applied extensively. A number of recommendations regarding critical decision making areas were also formulated.",Naudé M.C.; Terblanche L.S.,Strategic,,,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the need for strategic planning and the development of a marketing strategy in a social service agency, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and direction.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,The development of a marketing strategy by Centurion Community Services; [Die ontwikkeling van 'n bemarkingstrategie vir centurion gemeenskapsdiens],2004
"Digital goods lend themselves to versioning but also suffer from piracy losses. This paper develops a pricing model for digital experience goods in a segmented market and explores the optimality of sampling as a piracy-mitigating strategy. Consumers are aware of the true fit of an experience good to their tastes only after consumption, and as piracy offers an additional (albeit illegal) consumption opportunity, traditional segmentation findings from economics and sampling recommendations from marketing, need to be revisited. We develop a two-stage model of piracy for a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation for quality and their moral costs. In our model, some consumers pirate the product in the first stage allowing them to update their fit-perception that may result in re-evaluation of their buying/pirating decision in the second stage. We recommend distinct pricing and sampling strategies for underestimated and overestimated products and suggest that any potential benefits of piracy can be internalized through product sampling. Two counterintuitive results stand out. First, piracy losses are more severe for products that do not live up to their hype rather than for those that have been undervalued in the market, thus requiring a greater deterrence investment for the former, and second, unlike physical goods where sampling is always beneficial for underestimated products, sampling for digital goods is optimal only under narrowly denned circumstances due to the price boundaries created by both piracy and segmentation. © 2005 INFORMS.",Chellappa R.K.; Shivendu S.,Strategic,10.1287/isre.1050.0069,Digital products; Experience goods; Piracy; Pricing; Sampling; Vertical segmentation,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The paper discusses pricing strategies and market segmentation for digital experience goods, focusing on long-term implications and strategic decisions to mitigate piracy losses.

"Purpose - To examine how companies are affected by economic crises, to assess the effects of marketing strategies on company performance in such conditions, and to identify those that can help companies to maintain successful performance despite turbulence in the operational environment. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire contained questions relating to 21 marketing strategies, associated with the elements of the marketing mix, plus a ""general marketing strategies"" category. It was completed by 172 Turkish companies, drawn from a national frame of 1,000. Data were analysed by factor analysis, with performance criteria set as the dependent variable. Results are reported for each of the elements of the marketing mix. Findings - Companies that modify their strategies appropriately can maintain or improve their performance in times of crisis. Conclusions and recommendations identify the strategic changes most likely to achieve that outcome, measured mainly in terms of sales, market share and profitability. Research limitations/implications - Subjective measures of performance were used because of practical obstacles to obtaining objective financial data from the sample, which would have severely reduced the response rate. Future studies should include such data in the analysis. They might also cross-index findings by company size, industry sector and market scope, and take account of company resources and skills. Practical implications - The findings provide valuable insights for decision makers and marketing planners in times of economic crisis, specifically in the Turkish context but potentially in general.

"Drawing on data derived from Motoring Which assessments, the study investigates the role of vehicle security in the decision of people to recommend the purchase of a particular car model to a friend. This is important because, were security to be shown to be salient in purchaser decision making, it would be a factor in incentivising manufacturers and retailers to incorporate and stress car security in marketing. Crucially for purchasing decisions, security was observed to contribute to the willingness of people to recommend the purchase of a particular car model in 2007. This was not significantly so in 2008, although the association was in the same direction. The results are interpreted as modestly encouraging for the importance of security in purchaser decision making. Research on the role of vehicle crime in diminishing brand loyalty is advocated.

"Most consumer decisions involve trade-offs of costs and benefits over time. The research literature on ""intertemporal choice"" examines behavioral regularities in how people think about such decisions, drawing from marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics. This diverse literature is relevant to the analysis of public policy issues related to consumers' discounting of future outcomes ""too much"" compared with sooner outcomes. A stream of outcomes can be viewed as occurring in three temporal regions: the present, the near future, and the more distant future. Somewhat different research streams have developed around the topic of underweighting outcomes in the distant (compared with the near) future and of overweighting outcomes in the present compared with any point in the future. The authors review key concepts from the literature on underweighting the distant future versus the near-term future to analyze policy issues related to consumers' saving for retirement and their response to rebates. The authors review key concepts from the literature on impulsive behavior and present-biased preferences to analyze the problems of self-control that people have in their consumption of ""sin"" products that are proximate and that affect rewards in the present. The authors critique current information and incentive remedies that ignore behavioral principles from the literature, focusing their recommendations on policy interventions designed to influence eating habits and obesity and on cooling-off laws that govern return policies for consumers' big-ticket purchases. © 2006, American Marketing Association.",Lynch Jr. J.G.; Zauberman G.,Strategic,10.1509/jppm.25.1.67,,5.0,,10,5,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses long-term behavioral patterns in consumer decision-making and public policy implications, which align with strategic planning and the analysis of overarching goals related to consumer behavior over time.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,"When do you want it?

"Internet companies extensively use the practice of drop-shipping, where the wholesaler stocks and owns the inventory and ships products directly to customers at retailers' request. Under the drop-shipping arrangement, the supply chain benefits from risk pooling because the inventory for multiple retailers is stocked at the same location, the wholesaler's. Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in which retailers stock and own the inventory. These two supply chain structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability, the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and transportation costs. © 2006 INFORMS.",Netessine S.; Rudi N.,Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.1060.0512,Competition; Drop-shipping; E-commerce; Equilibrium; Fulfillment; Supply chain,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses various supply chain structures and their implications for inventory management, risk allocation, and profitability, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategies.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Supply chain choice on the internet,2006

"It is evident that there has been increase in integration of global economies as trade barriers were lifted in 2005 resulting in free trade. After agriculture, marketing of hand-produced, cultural products constitutes the second most important source of income in less developed countries of the world. The objectives of this study were to examine US consumers’ perceptions of garments that were culturally inspired by a specific sending culture to better understand the following: (1) perceptions of garment familiarity and garment complexity; (2) the relationship between perceived familiarity and garment adoption/acceptance; (3) the relationship between perceived familiarity and garment adoption/acceptance; (4) acceptance for garments culturally inspired by consumers’ cultural setting or geographic location; (5) acceptance for garments culturally inspired among the different age groups ; and (6) delineation of US consumers’ cultural creativity. To accomplish this endeavor an instrument, developed for measuring consumers’ responses to design characteristics, was tested on US female consumers from five areas of the country and in two age categories. The instrument developed integrated visual stimuli of garments with Likert-type scales and provided consumer data for conducting basic research. Garment attributes included three styles, two color ways, and two fabric print (3 x 2 x 2) =12 garments. The analyses were exploratory in that concepts and relationships were evaluated in a non-causal approach to provide a basis for further research. Generalizatibility was addressed through analysis of multiple consumer groups; however the fashion aspects of the stimuli prevent broad-spectrum application. This study focuses on garments that are culturally inspired by Indonesia as the sending culture. Indonesia is a country with strong textile dyeing and printing traditions. Indonesia is open to westernized silhouettes and it is also an important global source for textiles and clothing production. The Indonesian textile and clothing industry is vertically integrated, encompassing almost every stage of production and contributes significantly to the country’s economy. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation theory provides a foundation for examining issues that inhibit or encourage the adoption of ideas, products, or technologies as they are introduced to individuals or groups of people. Within Roger’s model is a five stage innovation-decision process. This research is concerned with the persuasion stage where the individual forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation. The persuasion stage provided a foundation for examining relationships between familiarity, complexity, and acceptance of Indonesian inspired garments. The two persuasion characteristics of interest were compatibility and complexity of Indonesian inspired products for US consumers. Compatibility reflects how well an innovation is perceived to match existing social norms, needs, and expectations. Complexity concerns how difficult the innovation is perceived as to understand. Diffusion of Innovation is a generic adoption model for innovative ideas and products and was therefore somewhat restrictive for applications to fashion product adoption. Sproles’ Fashion Adoption Theory was thus also employed to understand the concepts of familiarity, complexity and acceptance in the context of women’s apparel attitudes of garment color, fabric print, and style. Also examined in this research were the differences in US consumer responses based on geographic location, age, and cultural creativity. Social influences, socioeconomic characteristics and behavioral norms fluctuate across the North American continent. Subnations are said to exist that define eight differing regions of the US and hold distinguishable characteristics. This research examined the following five subnations and their general US region: Breadbasket (middle), Dixie (southeast), Foundry (northeast), Ecotopia (northwest), and MexAmerica (southwest). In addition to geographic location, two age groups of US female consumers were examined: 19 to 25 years of age and 35 to 55 years of age. Additionally, consumers’ level of cultural creativity was measured. In the US the categories of Moderns and Traditionals are more readily recognized consumer groups than the Cultural Creative group. Cultural Creative, are distinguished by values such as engaged action, altruism, self-actualization, spirituality and ecological sustainability. Variation in Cultural Creative qualities and levels were expected to contribute a greater understanding of product acceptance. Pearson correlation coefficients, univariate analysis of variance with least significance difference post hoc analysis, and forward multiple regressions were run to address the research objectives. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered to the manufacturers of Indonesian inspired garments. To successfully cross market their products to countries like US, manufacturers can retain the color ways culturally inspired by Indonesia as the participants found them to be familiar and highly acceptable.Recommendations for fabric print and styles would suggest lower levels of cultural inspiration for US consumer acceptance. Retailers and manufacturers would also be wise to market their products with strategies and priorities based on the climatic and demographic characteristics of the nine sub-nations, and to consider age categories particularly women between the ages of 35-55 years. It is clear the textile and apparel industry in Indonesia has a number of strengths that have enabled the country to expand its share of international markets. The US importation numbers largely reflect production of US designed apparel with an absence of Indonesian cultural traditions. The potential for designing and marketing Indonesian inspired garments will be enhanced through dissemination of research-based information regarding US female consumer preferences. © 2010 KAMS.

"At-destination referrals from local experts play a critical and complementary role in information sourcing and venue decision strategies by visitors of a destination. This context-specific form of word-of-moulh communication is widely practiced, yet remains an under-researched phenomenon when taking into consideration the broad range of locals utilized by visitors when making at-destination decisions on travel-related services. Most word-of-mouth studies have examined its influence on consumer's purchase behavior, but few attempts have been made to investigate the local experts' perspective. This exploratory study attempts to contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon from the local experts' perspective from two aspects: (1) examining the nature and significance of at-destination recommendations; and (2) developing and testing a motivational construct of locals making recommendations. The results provide further evidence of a broad range of residents within a community being involved in the provision of venue information and direct property referrals. A test of motivational scale items reveals that five themes emerge as the underlying constructs driving the local experts' referral behavior.

"The Cape Shoe Company case focuses on an entrepreneurial start-up in the highly competitive shoe industry. Upon the closing of a Florsheim shoe factory in a region of the Midwest that was once home to a large number of shoe and apparel manufacturers, with the majority of these having closed over the previous 30 years due to lower cost of overseas production, and concerned about the continuing loss of shoe manufacturing in the U.S., an entrepreneur from Chicago with minimal experience in the shoe industry, visited a Florsheim factory prior to its closing by Florsheim. After deciding that the facility represented too valuable a resource to be abandoned, the entrepreneur subsequently purchased the shoe plant and named his new venture the Cape Shoe Company. Based on his concern about losing American manufacturing jobs, and the belief that he could produce a competitively priced product, his plan was to produce 100 percent Made in America shoes. The interesting focus of this particular case and ensuing discussions is that the entrepreneur has made the decision to go forward with Cape Shoe Company and his 100 percent Made in America theme, although having yet to determine target market(s), competition, product differentiation, marketing channels, marketing strategies, etc. Regarding the rather unique nature of the Cape Shoe Company start-up, and current industry scenario, students virtually have a clean slate in which to begin discussions concerning recommendations on strategic management and marketing questions.",Fishman E.; Sterrett J.L.; Kellerman B.J.; Gordon P.J.,Strategic,,,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the formation of the Cape Shoe Company and the entrepreneur's long-term vision to produce 100 percent Made in America shoes.

"Purpose The purpose of this research is to show how relationship marketing has recognized the importance of building long-term relationships in increasing firms' profitability and guaranteeing their future viability. Owing to the damaging effects that customer switching behavior could have on the development of successful relationships, understanding customers' switching decisions can represent a key step in the process of establishing, developing and maintaining successful relational exchanges. The current study aims to contribute in this direction by introducing the heterogeneity of customers in their relationship characteristics depth, length and breadth into the analysis of customers' propensity to switch service providers. Design-methodology-approach The data set used to carry out this study has been obtained from a panel survey Home Online of technology users in the United Kingdom, and the proposed hypotheses are tested on the fixed-line telephone sector using logistic regression. This technique associates the relationship characteristics with the probability that a switch in suppliers will take place. Findings The results obtained show that the length, depth and breadth of relationships help to determine customers' propensity to switch fixed-telephone suppliers. Customers who maintain a long-lasting relationship with the firm length, use the service more depth, and invest in complementary services breadth will be less predisposed to switch. Practical implications With regard to recommendations for practitioners, the paper highlights the need for firms to renew both acquisition and retention strategies in order to take individual customer information into account. This should help them to identify and retain the most valuable customers and to optimally allocate marketing resources from switching-prone to non-switching-prone customers. Originality-value The main contribution of the paper is to consider relationship characteristics in the analysis of customer switching behavior.

"Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aids for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives X attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making. In particular, we focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality and the efficiency of purchase decisions - shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort. This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.",Häubl G.; Trifts V.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.19.1.4.15178,Consideration sets; Consumer behavior; Decision aids; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information processing; Information search; Online shopping; Recommendation agents,5.0,,15,0,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the implementation of interactive decision aids that assist consumers in their purchase decision-making process in online shopping environments.

"With the introduction of the Australian Organ Donation Register, responsibility regarding organ donation decisions primarily rests with the individual. However, family members can be instrumental in facilitating or hindering the rate of organ donation by objecting to or confirming the individual's wishes. Attitudes and beliefs of family members have been shown to be a strong influence on people's intentions to donate. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that family communication about organ donation can improve the rate of organ donation. We surveyed 23 matched pairs of undergraduate university students and their parents and found that attitudes to organ donation were positive and that there was a tendency for these dyads to give concordant responses regarding attitudes, level of family communication, and intent to donate.

"Companies operating on the internet need appropriate metrics to support strategic marketing decisions. These metrics may relate to traditional performance measures but have the potential to include new metrics or new ways of collecting existing metrics. This paper addresses the question of how web-based companies can use emetrics for strategic marketing decisions. Specifically, it identifies some aspects of the current use of emetrics in strategic marketing decisions within the web environment. In a preliminary investigation, interviews with web-based business units revealed that companies currently measure website performance and consumer behaviour online but are uncertain how best to use those metrics to inform strategic marketing decisions. The findings suggest that businesses are looking for recommendations regarding management and choice of emetrics that will increase comparability among companies as well as overcome current data limitations. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Weischedel B.; Matear S.; Deans K.R.,Strategic,10.1504/ijima.2005.007507,emetrics; internet; marketing strategy; New Zealand; performance metrics; strategic decisions,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses how web-based companies can utilize emetrics for strategic marketing decisions, indicating a focus on long-term planning and the overall goals of the organization.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,The use of emetrics in strategic marketing decisions: a preliminary investigation,2005

"The presence of international students is a valuable input for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) at all levels. Thus, it is critical to understand not only how students make their decisions and what factors and sources of information provided by the HEI most influence them, but also to evaluate students’ satisfaction and loyalty with the choice made, in order to define the most suitable and competitive marketing strategies to attract and retain international students. Based on the information gathered through a questionnaire with a sample of 190 international students studying at a Portuguese HEI, a quantitative, cross-sectional and causal study was conducted using the estimation of a structural equation model calculated through PLS, in order to investigate the impact of choice factors and information sources on international students’ loyalty, mediated by satisfaction with the choice made. The findings indicate that the choice factors with the greatest impact on satisfaction of the international students were: the perception of the country, the environment and location of the HEI, and the sources of information provided by the HEI. It was also concluded that a positive global perception of the HEI influences the recommendation from significant others, and increases the satisfaction and loyalty of all the international students. Thus, HEI managers should account for these factors when making strategic marketing decisions to increase the number of international students. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Amaro D.M.; Marques A.M.A.; Alves H.,Strategic,10.1007/s12208-019-00228-0,Choice factors and information sources; International students; Loyalty; PLS; Satisfaction,5.0,,10,0,Springer,The abstract discusses the long-term implications of understanding international students' decision-making processes and satisfaction in order to define competitive marketing strategies for Higher Education Institutions (HEI).

"An essential function that is recommended for destinations and tourism and hospitality organizations to undertake is to learn about developments in the external environment that may have a substantial impact on the competitiveness of their business. The healthy-living lifestyle has been gaining momentum in the USA and in various parts of the world; more than ever, programs, products, and regulations are being developed and implemented to cater to members of the mentioned lifestyle and to support the overall well being of societies. In the field of travel and tourism, health has been approached from the angle of tourism experiences' effects on an individual's well being. There has been no attempt to explore the characteristics of a healthy-living market segment and its travel motivational characteristics. This article presents the findings of a research project that aimed at unveiling the travel motivational characteristics of the healthy-living market segment along with its socio-demographic characteristics. In today's competitive environment, it has become a must to learn about a specific segment's characteristics. Destinations as well as tourism/hospitality organizations cannot afford to waste their resources on decisions taken based on personal opinions and not hard intelligence on specific markets of interest.

"The most essential theory of loyalty marketing is that a small increase in loyal customers can bring a significant increase in profitability to a business. Recently, businesses in various industries have turned single-brand loyalty programs into corporate-wide loyalty programs across different brands. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of strategic alliance on customer loyalty in the hotel industry.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the referral patterns of local residents who are frequently requested by visitors to the community to provide information and/or direct venue referrals for travel-related services. Also investigated, were the factors influencing the selection of a specific venue being referred. It is posited that visitors delay many travel decisions until they arrive at a destination and extensively utilize local ""experts"" in their decision strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The current study expands upon previous research on visitor decision strategies for travel-related services once that are at a destination by examining the referral activity of 180 residents in the metro-Orlando area, a destination that attracts more than 47 millions visitors each year. A standardized questionnaire was utilized to collect data in two distinct areas of the destination, a central tourism corridor and a bedroom community. Findings - In general, at-destination recommendations from locals were found to be highly sought by visitors, regardless of the occupation of the perceived local expert. In addition, although the weekly frequency of requests to a local expert was typically lower in the bedroom community in contrast to the tourism corridor, they still existed in significant enough numbers such that they should capture the attention of enterprises providing such services. At the least, a partial alignment of an enterprise's promotional strategies and tactics to reach targeted visitor segments through ""locals"" becomes obvious. Overall, notable recommendation patterns were not uniform across type of service enterprise, and were highly evident for food and beverage and entertainment facilities, while recommendations for lodging facilities were found to be limited in this study. It was also determined that local residents were most influenced by organic factors compared to induced factors. Research limitations/implications - The results suggest that hospitality businesses should focus a portion of their marketing strategies and tactics towards the community in order to attain/drive positive word-of-mouth referrals. This implication is particularly relevant for restaurants and shopping venues. Finally, it is suggested that the most effective way for businesses to reach local residents is through direct contact and communication, rather than traditional advertising channels. Originality/value - The paper has both theoretical and practical value, and provides further confirmation that tourists delay/make many decisions post-arrival and that locals play an important role in travel-decision process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Walls A.; Shani A.; Rompf P.D.,Tactical,10.1108/09596110810892218,Communities; Decision making; Information exchange; Tourism; Travel; United States of America,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses specific marketing strategies and tactics for hospitality businesses to improve word-of-mouth referrals from local residents.

"This paper discusses important policy and management implications of tourism as a mixed industry in which public, not-for-profit, and private organisations such as festivals both compete and collaborate in creating the tourist product. To illustrate, four samples of festivals from the UK, Australia, Norway and Sweden are systematically compared in terms of their ownership, governance, structure, and content. Although the festivals offered a similar product and had similar mandates, they differed considerably in terms of revenue sources, cost structure, use of volunteers, corporate sponsorship, and decision-making. These differences are potentially important to destinations that view festivals as attractions and use them in place marketing. Implications are drawn for festival management and tourism policy, and recommendations are made for extending this line of inquiry to the tourism industry as a whole. © 2008.",Andersson T.D.; Getz D.,Strategic,10.1016/j.tourman.2008.12.008,Business models; Festivals; Mixed industry; Ownership,5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of tourism policy and management in relation to festivals, focusing on how different ownership and governance structures influence the tourist product, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,"Tourism as a mixed industry: Differences between private, public and not-for-profit festivals",2009
"Purpose – Health is becoming an increasingly important issue in the UK as well as the rest of Europe. Emphasis on the importance of healthy eating is ongoing for many reasons, including the growing concern about childhood obesity resulting in the ban of advertising of unhealthy foods to children in the UK in April 2007. However, although legislation has been placed upon the advertising of unhealthy food products, no such restrictions have been placed on the packaging of children's foods despite the influence of packaging on consumer buyer decisions. This paper aims to investigate the effect of packaging on children's product preferences and its ability to influence parents' buyer decision in-store. Design/methodology/approach – The study was approached from the parents' rather than the children's perspective. A quantitative approach was adopted in data collection, using a 28 item Likert scaled questionnaire administered to 150 parents, with over 95 percent response rate. Findings – The study shows that packaging does affect the product preferences of children. Also, children are particularly interested in influencing the purchase of unhealthy foods. However, parents within the study claimed that they did not succumb to their children's requests for the purchase of unhealthy food, which contradicts evidence from previous findings. Research limitations/implications – The claim by parents that they did not succumb to their children's requests for unhealthy food contradicts findings from previous research. This therefore leads to a recommendation for further studies as social desirability bias may have influenced the outcomes of the findings. Practical implications – Findings from this study can be applied within the retail and service marketing sector to provide the practitioner with information relevant to decision making on children's influence on parents buyer behavior in-store. Outcomes of the study are also important when considering the future of children's food marketing and tackling the issue of childhood obesity.

"Recommendations often play a positive role in the decision process by reducing the difficulty associated with choosing between options. However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive and more undesirable role from the perspectives of both the recommending agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.",Fitzsimons G.J.; Lehmann D.R.,Operational,10.1287/mksc.1030.0033,Decision support systems; Intelligent agents; Internet marketing; Recommendations,5.0,,60,5,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses consumer reactions to recommendations made by experts and intelligent agents, focusing on day-to-day decision-making processes and the unintended consequences of those recommendations.

"Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case is the pricing of consumer goods in International Markets. Secondary issues include price discrimination by small firms in foreign markets; product differentiation in international markets; branding and price discrimination. This case has a difficulty level of 3-4 and is targeted at business students in a first course in international business or international marketing. The case can be used either as a functional case on pricing in the international environment, or as a study in exporting. One hour of class time should be sufficient to handle the case discussion and students should budget 2-3 hours of time for case preparation. Case Synopsis: The PURAC Enviro-Filter Company is a small manufacturer of air filters located in southern Florida, USA. Diana Page, the firm's marketing manager is in the process of determining her target price for the upcoming year for their most profitable product, the F-18 filter. Just as she was finalizing her recommendation, one of her salespeople approached her with the possibility of entering into a contract for a distributor branded sale to Russia. This would be a new market for her company. The price offered by the Russian mass merchandiser is much lower than that charged for branded PURAC filters in the domestic market. This new market opportunity complicates Diana's decision process. She must decide at what price to offer her goods for sale at home, and consider the relative advantages of the new offer presented by the foreign market proposal. She must decide the probably effect of these additional sales on the firm's profitability and what conditions to negotiate with the Russian company if PURAC decides to accept their offer. © 2009 by the DreamCatchers Group.",Sjolander R.; Eppright D.,Tactical,,,5.0,,15,0,,"The case focuses on the pricing strategy for a specific product (the F-18 filter) in an international market context, which involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable pricing targets and decisions regarding market entry.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Purac Enviro-Filter Company,2009
"Proposes the use of relationship management as a perspective on student retention management in higher education. ""Good practice"" that might aid in the management of student engagement with learning is hungrily shared, but there are some inherent contradictions amongst these recommendations.

This article proposes that the relationship marketing and management approach that focuses on customer loyalty and commitment may offer different insights. This model is used to describe the development of the relationship between the student and their college or university.

"Recent studies have shown that consumers' product choices are significantly influenced by media coverage and recommendations in various media outlets. Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002-2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States.

"Purpose - This paper aims to note the imitation of apparently successful advertising as a replacement for thought by too many advertisers, misapplying the tactics of what seem to be past successes by other companies to current situations, sometimes not even attempting to find insight relevant to the current advertising situation. Imitation of what may be lucky accidents has become a tool for improper applications of old tactics to new problems.

Originality/value - The paper shows that, since advertising decisions are often the recommendations from outside suppliers, business managers who pay for this advice must realize that past success by others does not mean that an imitative effort will enjoy similar success.

"With dramatic changes in the policies and practices of marketing healthcare to the public, providers of mental health services are being forced to consider strategies for more effectively and competitively promoting their services. Little empirical information relating to the manner in which prospective clients choose such services in a competitive, and often confusing, marketplace is currently available. The purpose of this study was to explore search strategies that might be used by consumers to identify potential providers of mental health services. In the present study, young adults were asked to rate the likelihood of using each of 19 empirically-derived sources of information in selecting a mental health provider. Factor analysis, as well as descriptive item analyses, suggest that, as is the case with certain other health care decision-making situations, consumers are most likely to depend on personal sources of information such as physician referrals and recommendations from friends and co-workers. In addition, several sources converge to suggest the importance to providers of establishing relationships with other professionals and with institutions in order to successfully market their services.

"The defense industry has been experiencing a large draw-down during the 1990s. This has left many companies, large and small, in a situation where they had to examine the viability and future of their businesses. While large and medium-size companies were somewhat assisted by government policies and support, small subcontractors were often left alone, facing higher risks and severe threats to their future. This research investigated the events, decisions, activities and success of small defense contractors, which had to face this new situation. It developed a specific framework, which may be used to help companies in assessing their conversion efforts. The study was conducted by utilizing a within-case and cross-case methodology for case study analysis. Results assert the difficulties for highly defense dependent companies to enter and succeed in the commercial market and explain why many conversion efforts have often failed in the past. Our findings show that to convert successfully, companies must streamline and improve their internal processes, develop a strategic plan, develop their marketing capabilities, and must have management and employee commitment to the process. Although such recommendations were expected, we found, that to many of these companies, they were completely new.

"While many measures address, say, marketing ethics, relatively less attention has been paid to ethical dilemmas and decision-making specifically in project management. This paper presents results from the development of a multidimensional measure of ethical dilemmas and decision-making in project management. The investigator developed three vignettes representing ethical dilemmas that could be realistically found in three phases of most projects (the planning, execution, and termination phases). Each vignette is followed by Reidenbach and Robin's (Reidenbach RE, Robin DP. Toward the development of a multidimensional scale for improving evaluations in business ethics. Journal of Business Ethics 1990;9:639-653) 30-item response scale tapping five theories of ethics: Justice, Relativism, Egoism, Utilitarianism, and Deontology. Results from 247 management undergraduates doing project management validate the three vignettes and support this approach in stimulating heated class discussion on ethics.

"It has been widely recognized that marketing's interaction with other functional departments (e.g., R&D) has significant impact on new product success. However, little research addresses how marketing actually behaves in the process of new product development (NPD). Drawing upon marketing, product innovation, and organizational buying literatures, this study contributes to the literature by delineating the types of influence tactics adopted by marketing and investigating how the use of these tactics affects marketing's influence on NPD decisions. Data on 128 new product projects from 114 high technology firms in China were collected from R&D perspective via on-site interviews. The findings indicate that, from the R&D's perspective, both marketing and R&D seem to have equivalent influence on new product decisions. In terms of usage frequency, the most frequently used influence tactics by marketing are persistent pressure, information exchange, and recommendation (i.e., use of rational logic). Coalition formation (e.g., seeking the support of peers) and upward appeal (i.e., seeking support from superiors) tactics are moderately used. The less frequently used tactics are legalistic plea (i.e., use of rules and regulations) and request. Regarding the effectiveness of influence tactics, the results indicate that persistent pressure, information exchange, and coalition formation lead to higher marketing influence in NPD decisions. However, the use of an upward appeal tactic leads to lower marketing influence. Recommendation, legalistic plea and request tactics are unrelated to marketing's influence. Our results also show that the efficacy of marketing's influence tactics is contingent upon the degree of functional interdependence in the NPD stages and the degree of interdepartmental conflict. Information exchange and coalition formation tactics are more effective at the initiation stage of the NPD process whereas legalistic plea and persistent pressure are more effective at the implementation stage. We further find that legalistic plea is more effective but coalition tactic is less effective when the degree of interdepartmental conflict is higher. Findings of this study provide managers responsible for ensuring market-oriented NPD with a better understanding of how the influence of marketing in the NPD process may be enhanced. Given our focus on Chinese firms, they also suggest that managers need to be sensitive to the cultural context of marketing influence.",Atuahene-Gima K.; Li H.,Tactical,10.1016/S0737-6782(00)00059-X,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses specific influence tactics used by marketing in the new product development process, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Marketing's influence tactics in new product development: A study of high technology firms in China,2000
"Purpose - The study outlined in this paper seeks to deepen one's understanding of the theoretical and practical implications for marketing management where an internet component has been added to the business. Design/methodology/approach - Cases were developed primarily from individual in-depth interviews with 30 managers from financial services. Findings - In setting up an e-commerce capability the case study organizations have been taking strategic decisions on customer interaction. Aligning channels cost-effectively with appropriate customers requires difficult decisions to be made in targeting and managing different customer segments. At the operational level many aspects of customer interaction can be handled centrally, moving the emphasis of customer management into customer service departments. Research limitations/implications - The question of how best to manage customers effectively, using e-service in an integrated manner with other channels, can be seen to be complex and requires further research in order to extend theory in this area and give more meaningful guidance to marketing practitioners. Practical implications - The marketing function has the potential to play a prime role in ensuring that remote customer management is effective. Recommendations are made for practising managers on developing an integrated channel strategy; setting up processes for managing customer feedback from the new channels and responding to this feedback. Originality/value - E-service is throwing up new and fundamental challenges for organizations and this potentially provides new opportunities for marketing practitioners to play a leading role at strategic and operational levels. However, in the cases marketing management's strategic and operational contribution to resolving these issues was limited.",Hughes T.,Strategic,10.1108/08876040710758577,Case studies; Marketing management,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the strategic implications of integrating e-service into marketing management, emphasizing the need for long-term planning and decision-making regarding customer interaction and channel alignment.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Regaining a seat at the table: Marketing management and the e-service opportunity,2007
"This research investigated the issues and methods of analysis considered by executives when managing biotechnology drug candidates within the research and development (R&D) pipeline. A mail survey was developed to assess: (1) factors considered during clinical trials; (2) sources of funding for R&D; (3) analytic tools used in decision-making; and (4) the use and application of pharmacoeconomics, and targeted primarily Chief Financial Officers (CFO) within 396 biotechnology firms in the United States (US). Consistent with prior research on CFOs, a response rate of 7.5 per cent was achieved and respondents generally represented smaller biotechnology companies valued below US$100m. Findings indicated that regulatory and capital requirements as well as investor expectations were important factors throughout clinical phase trials. Venture capital and capital/securities markets were the most commonly used sources of R&D capital. The most frequently cited decision-making techniques used included prior experience/intuition/ human judgment, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Pharmacoeconomic methods were utilised at every stage of R&D and applied to the management of R&D pipelines in addition to aspects of product pricing and reimbursement. Overall, these results reflect the nature of risk and uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D. Although the use of past experience/intuition/human judgment was most common for decision-making, methods based upon discounted cash flow (DCF) approaches were also employed frequently, as was the use of pharmacoeconomics. The implications of this work should seek to catalyse the development and utilisation of robust methods to manage drug pipelines such that senior executives are afforded optimal recommendations when attempting to hedge risk and maximise return.",Skrepnek G.H.; Sarnowski J.J.,Out of scope,10.1057/palgrave.jcb.3050040,,0.0,,0,100,,"The abstract primarily discusses issues related to biotechnology drug candidates and R&D management, which is not related to marketing activities.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Decision-making associated with drug candidates in the biotechnology research and development (R&D) pipeline,2007
"Risk relief services (RRSs), as complementary to online trust promoting services, are becoming versatile options for risk reduction in online consumer-to-consumer auctions. In this paper, we identify factors that affect the behavior of buyers in an online auction market who had to either adopt or not adopt online escrow services (OES). An experimental C2C auction system with embedded decision support features was used to collect data. Results show that market factors, such as fraud rate, product price, and seller's reputation are important in determining buyers' OES adoption. This study also finds that sellers' reputation has a significant effect on buyer's risk perception, which influences his OES adoption decision. Furthermore, the buyers' OES adoption decisions were found to be congruent with the implied recommendations that were based on expected utility calculations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Extensive shooting and angling causes, indirectly, fatal lead poisoning of birds. European Union policy on this major source of pollution is inconsistent with its laws regulating other forms of lead in the environment. Only three countries have banned the use of lead shot completely in the European Union, despite availability of substitutes and evidence that their use is a major contributor to bird conservation. The European Commission uses the criterion of amount of lead deposited and corroded, and the concentration of lead in water and soil, as the basis of their decisions. The USA and Canada used the prevalence of lead poisoning among birds as the basis of policy and law allowing them to reduce lead use at the continental level. The EU and North American policies and law on lead reduction are compared in this study, on the basis of which recommendations are developed indicating how the EU could revise its approach and resolve this environmental problem. Reluctance to act on lead reduction by the European Parliament and its member states refl ects the current vested interests of the sporting communities.

"Alpine landscapes arouse emotions and yearnings: feelings of belongings, freedom, or holidays. Images and notions about Alpine landscapes not only influence landscape experiences, they also play an important role in decision-making processes and conflict mitigation. Different stakeholders - ie locals, tourists, tourist entreprenuers, politicians, farmers, hunters, etc - regard Alpine landscapes with different eyes, yet there are also connecting elements: these are referred to in tourism marketing and in political dialogue. The present article develops a conceptual model landscape perception consisting of 4 poles - 'nature' and 'culture' as well as 'individual' and 'society' - that contributes to a better understanding of the meanings that landscapes have for different people. The model helps to find existing commonalities among stakeholders and overcome obstacles.

"Organ donation consent rates have stagnated at about 50%, while the need for transplantable organs continues to increase. This article focuses on consent rates of families who make a donation decision for a deceased loved one, and how social marketing efforts to increase organ donation can be enhanced by better understanding the decision-making process these families use. Three categories of factors bear significantly on that decision which, if not addressed properly, will very likely result in a refusal to donate. These deal breaker categories include (1) family predisposition and family care, (2) requestor characteristics, and (3) request dynamics. Recommendations are made toward developing best practices protocols which roughly parallel promotion activities and the selling process utilized in commercial marketing for overcoming these barriers.",Aldridge A.; Guy B.S.,Out of scope,10.1080/07359680802131509,Consent barriers; Consent rates; Organ donation; Request process; Transplantation,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses organ donation consent rates and factors influencing family decisions, which are primarily related to healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Deal breakers in the organ donation request process,2008
"Reflecting recent European and International trends, the Irish financial services sector has witnessed phenomenal technological and competitive developments, affecting consumer decision–making and behaviour and forcing financial suppliers to re–assess their approach to setting customer expectations and assessing the consumer experience. This study, using a purposive sample of financial services managers and experts, shows suppliers increasingly struggling to practice external accountability to their customers and internal accountability to their employees. In terms of external accountability, suppliers identified numerous brand–related issues and challenges, including the increasing lack of brand differentiation and the difficulties in creating meaningful brand images, which are posing significant difficulties in creating positive and appealing customer expectations. In relation to internal accountability, suppliers highlighted the challenges associated with empowering their employees to provide a personal and superior service and meeting the evolving requirements of an increasingly diverse customer base. Recommendations are made in relation to the incorporation of consumer research, internal marketing and technology in order to provide a banking experience which facilitates supplier commitment and accountability to both customers and employees. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",O'loughlin D.; Szmigin I.,Strategic,10.1080/09652540500083008,Expectations vs. experience; Financial supplier accountability; Irish banking sector,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses long-term trends and challenges within the Irish financial services sector, focusing on external and internal accountability, brand differentiation, and consumer expectations.

"This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumerproduct matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individuallevel diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences. © 2009 INFORMS.",Fleder D.; Hosanagar K.,Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.1080.0974,Advertising and media; Application contexts/sectors; Electronic commerce; It impacts on industry and market structure; It policy and management; Marketing,5.0,,15,0,,"The paper discusses the effects of recommender systems on sales diversity, which relates to specific marketing strategies and decisions.

"Purpose – In this paper the competitive landscape of financial institutions is shifting and internet banking is no longer a competitive advantage but a competitive necessity for banks. However, a limited number of empirical studies have been published in the marketing literature about electronic banking. This paper seeks to examine consumers' choices between electronic banking and non-electronic banking in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows that the data for this analysis were obtained through a mail survey sent to 1,960 households in New Zealand. The decision to use electronic banking is hypothesised to be a function of service quality dimensions, perceived risk factors, user input factors, price factors, service product characteristics, individual factors and demographic variables such as age, gender, marital status, income, etc. Logistic regression is used to analyse the data. The discrete dependent variable measures whether an individual is an electronic banking or non-electronic banking user. Findings – The findings in the paper show that the output from the logistic regression indicates that the service quality, perceived risk factors, user input factors, employment, and education are the dominant variables that influence consumers' choice of electronic banking and non-electronic banking channels. Practical implications – This paper provides an improved understanding of consumers' choice between electronic and non-electronic banking. This paper also identifies new relationships, and provides findings that further support, confirm, or contradict previous studies. In addition, it provides insights into the links between electronic banking and consumer decision making, to help provide strategies, recommendations and guidelines for the banking industry.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the development of a methodology to evaluate suppliers using portfolio analysis based on the analytical network process (ANP) and environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a three-step process, first by evaluating influence/power and performance scores of suppliers using ANP. They include environmental dimensions in this analysis, then map these suppliers onto a portfolio grid. Recommendations are also made on how to manage suppliers depending on what part of the portfolio they appear based on the scores. Findings: The technique is useful and versatile. The paper clearly discerns various characteristics of the suppliers and produced recommendations on supplier management for an exemplary case scenario. Research limitations/implications: The technique was applied for an illustrative example. Validation and application in a real world setting is required. There are many additional opportunities to further integrate other modeling tools into this process. Practical implications: Managers can use this technique to help them more effectively deal with suppliers. The portfolio is a good tool for operational and strategic management of suppliers.

"A global industry of festivals and events has evolved and developed rapidly since the early 1900s. This phenomenal growth, coupled with increased consumer awareness and choice, requires sustained development and growth in the future. Music festivals are unique events that attract audiences for a variety of reasons; however, while music-based events are an extremely popular form of entertainment, research exploring the motivations of music festival audiences is sparse, especially from a UK perspective. Crompton and McKay contend that event managers should strive to better understand the motives of festival attendance in order to design better products and services for them and because motives are a precursor of satisfaction and a factor in decision making, this in turn can lead to greater attendance. This study critically compares the visitor motivations for attending two UK-based music festivals to challenge and ultimately support existing ideas developed from similar research overseas. The article establishes some of the first research into this area within the UK and challenges common assumptions from those in industry. A range of secondary research was considered and a review of existing literature on the subject was undertaken. Although the sample size was relatively small, the results showed that socializing with friends and family was a primary motive. Most importantly, the article supported the notion that multiple motivations come into play and it suggests that it is risky for festival managers to rely solely on the theme of the event itself. It is equally important to create a fun and festive atmosphere that offers ample opportunity to socialize and have new and nonmusical experiences. Several recommendations were made for existing and future managers including focusing on realigning marketing and service strategies. Recommendations were also made for future research in terms of adopting new methodological approaches including the use of multiple means of analysis. The article finally challenges the nature of the underpinning theory and questions the reason that so much of what is understood is still based in the field of sociology in tourism, with very little underpinning theory dedicated to the events industry, despite its emergence as an academic field over a decade ago. © 2009 Cognizant Comm.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss and assess the consecutive Governments' policy for coal (1989-2006) in the context of the systemic transformation of the Polish economy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a critical analysis of the rationale and effectiveness of government efforts to restructure the Polish coal mining industry in the light of economic theory, published literature, and a survey of three collieries. Some parallels, toutes proportions gardées, are drawn between the situation in the UK under Margaret Thatcher and that in Poland. Findings: The paper arguesthat, despite throwing billions of zlotys at the industry in the form of direct subsidies and debt write-offs, decision makers failed to make the collieries economically sound. The weaknesses of the consecutive governments - manifesting itself, amongst other things, in the unwillingness and/or inability to confront the miners' unions, to introduce market mechanisms into the sector, to ensure competent management and, crucially, to press on with nationwide economic liberalisation - are seen as the principal reasons behind the failure. Practical implications: The paper highlights the root causes of government ineffectiveness as well as aspires to provide policy recommendations with a view to rendering the Polish coal industry economically viable in a free-market reality. Originality/value - It presents the coal mining industry as a relic of socialism and highlights the inconsistencies and inadequacies of the consecutive restructuring programmes; concludes that restructuring efforts - to be truly effective - have to be co-ordinated with nationwide economic liberalisation.",Zientara P.,Strategic,10.1108/17506220710821143,Coal; Government policy; Poland,10.0,,5,5,,"The abstract discusses the long-term policy for coal in Poland, assessing government effectiveness and recommending restructuring aligned with economic liberalization.

Specifically, it reports the results of a series of in-depth interviews conducted with Greek marketing professional employed by multinationals in Greece. A number of topics examining ethical problems, ethical standards, corporate policy instruments and corporate culture served as a basis for discussion. While the occasionally contrasting opinions revealed in part the perplexity of marketing ethics, respondents also arrived at points of convergence. All recognized government as playing the most prominent role in issues of public concern, legislation and overall ethical standards. Moreover, all marketers identified multinational and other foreign firms as a positive influence to the level of ethics, due to the introduction of policy instruments and control mechanisms.

Although consumers use a variety of recommendation sources, they have different motivations for the use of different sources. The model focuses on the factors that influence the likelihood of consumers using strong-tie sources (e.g., friends and family) and weak-tie sources (e.g., acquaintances or strangers) of recommendations. The factors used in the model are the prior knowledge level of the consumer about the product being considered, the perceived decision task difficulty level, and the type of evaluative cues sought by the consumer.
