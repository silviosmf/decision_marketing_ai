Not complacent but scared: another look at the causes of strategic inertia among successful firms from a regulatory focus perspective,Rusetski A.; Lim L.K.S.,2011,10.1080/0965254X.2011.557743,"While complacency is the most commonly offered explanation for the lack of strategic change among successful firms, research in management psychology suggests otherwise. Based on regulatory focus theory, we propose that competitive success prompts an increased sense of responsibility in managers, causing them to assume a defensive attitude and to concentrate on preserving the status quo instead of becoming complacent. Data collected from the Markstrat simulation support our predictions. The findings imply that efforts to encourage strategic change by pressurizing managers will backfire, because they will aggravate managers' defensive attitude. Instead, firms should loosen the pressure on managers and allow them to experiment with innovative strategies. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",decision making; marketing strategy; Markstrat; regulatory focus; strategic inertia,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the implications of managerial behavior towards strategic change in successful firms, suggesting that competitive success leads to a defensive attitude that preserves the status quo.

Compatibility effects in evaluations of satisfaction and loyalty,Auh S.; Johnson M.D.,2005,10.1016/j.joep.2003.10.002,"The goal of this research is to help understand the difference between satisfaction and loyalty based on the nature of the judgment tasks involved. By drawing on the notion of the prediction- decision inconsistency, we posit satisfaction as a consumption/experience utility and loyalty as a decision utility to explain the missing link between satisfaction and loyalty. An important assumption that may be driving the prediction-decision inconsistency, but has not been addressed, is the different criteria that consumers use in arriving at the two different types of utilities. The authors argue that this difference affects the compatibility, and resulting influence, of quality versus price information on satisfaction and loyalty evaluations. An empirical study of 183 firms using data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index is reported which supports the proposed compatibility effects. Implications for marketing theory and practice are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Managerial risk perceptions of international entry-mode strategies: The interaction effect of control and capability,Forlani D.; Parthasarathy M.; Keaveney S.M.,2008,10.1108/02651330810877225,"Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate how opportunity for control and firm capability interact to moderate the amount of risk that managers associate with various international entry-mode strategies. A secondary goal is to investigate how managers perceive the need to retain control over three core functional areas (marketing, production, and R&D) when making entry-mode decisions. Design/methodology/approach - A field experiment design was implemented in a sample of US business owner/executives. Using an online data collection method, the study asked a sample of small-business owners and managers to assess the amount of risk they associated with three modes of entering the Japanese market: non-ownership (export), equal partnership (50/50 joint-venture), and sole-ownership. They were also asked how much control they needed to retain over R&D, production, and marketing for the venture to be successful. Findings - Ownership-provided control interacts with capability to influence managerial risk perceptions. Managers in lower-capability firms see the least risk in the non-ownership entry mode while those in higher-capability firms see the least risk in the equal-partnership entry mode. Managers believe that for a new venture in a foreign market to be successful, control should be retained over the R&D function, regardless of entry mode. Research limitations/implications - The findings appear to reconcile some of the conflicting predictions of the transaction cost and resource-based theoretical perspectives, because it appears that international managers consider both control (internationalization theory) and capability (resource-based theory) when judging the perceived risk of an entry strategy. Practical implications - For firms that are incapable of managing in an international context, a low-control no-ownership entry mode is perceived as the least risky approach; for firms that have some capability for international management, then a partial-ownership mode such as a 50/50 joint-venture is perceived as having lower risk than no-ownership. In non-ownership and joint-venture type entry modes, managers are more apt to outsource the marketing function to an agent/partner, but not R&D. In contrast, managers believe that marketing needs to be maintained in-house when utilizing a sole-ownership entry mode. Originality/value - By illustrating the role of perceived risk in foreign-market entry-mode decisions and demonstrating how capabilities interact with ownership-provided control to moderate these perceptions, the paper's findings suggest that managers' risk perceptions may mediate the effects of firm-specific factors, and thus contributes significantly to both theory and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Japan; Market entry; Marketing decision making; Overseas trade; Risk management; Small enterprises,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses how managers perceive and manage risks associated with international market entry strategies, which involves long-term planning and decision-making related to the firm's strategic goals and capabilities.",70,15,10,0,5
Consumption self-control by rationing purchase quantities of virtue and vice,Wertenbroch K.,1998,10.1287/mksc.17.4.317,"Consumers' attempts to control their unwanted consumption impulses influence many everyday purchases with broad implications for marketers' pricing policies. Addressing theoreticians and practitioners alike, this paper uses multiple empirical methods to show that consumers voluntarily and strategically ration their purchase quantities of goods that are likely to be consumed on impulse and that therefore may pose self-control problems. For example, many regular smokers buy their cigarettes by the pack, although they could easily afford to buy 10-pack cartons. These smokers knowingly forgo sizable per-unit savings from quantity discounts, which they could realize if they bought cartons; by rationing their purchase quantities, they also self-impose additional transactions costs on marginal consumption, which makes excessive smoking overly difficult and costly. Such strategic self-imposition of constraints is intuitively appealing yet theoretically problematic. The marketing literature lacks operationalizations and empirical tests of such consumption self-control strategies and of their managerial implications. This paper provides experimental evidence of the operation of consumer self-control and empirically illustrates its direct implications for the pricing of consumer goods. Moreover, the paper develops a conceptual frame-work for the design of empirical tests of such self-imposed constraints on consumption in consumer goods markets. Within matched pairs of products, we distinguish relative ""virtue"" and ""vice"" goods whose preference ordering changes with whether consumers evaluate immediate or delayed consumption consequences. For example, ignoring long-term health effects, many smokers prefer regular (relative vice) to light (relative virtue) cigarettes, because they prefer the taste of the former. However, ignoring these short-term taste differences, the same smokers prefer light to regular cigarettes when they consider the long-term health effects of smoking. These preference orders can lead to dynamically inconsistent consumption choices by consumers whose tradeoffs between the immediate and delayed consequences of consumption depend on the time lag between purchase and consumption. This creates a potential self-control problem, because these consumers will be tempted to overconsume the vices they have in stock at home. Purchase quantity rationing helps them solve the self-control Problem by limiting their stock and hence their consumption opportunities. Such rationing implies that, per purchase occasion, vice consumers will be less likely than virtue consumers to buy larger quantities in response to unit price reductions such as quantity discounts. We first test this prediction in two laboratory experiments. We then examine the external validity of the results at the retail level with a field survey of quantity discounts and with a scanner data analysis of chain-wide store-level demand across a variety of different pairs of matched vice (regular) and virtue (reduced fat, calorie, or caffeine, etc.) product categories. The analyses of these experimental, field, and scanner data provide strong convergent evidence of a characteristic crossover in demand schedules for relative vices and virtues for categories as diverse as, among others, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, cream cheese, beer, soft drinks, ice cream and frozen yogurt, chewing gum, coffee, and beef and turkey bologna. Vice consumers' demand increases less in response to price reductions than virtue consumers' demand, although their preferences are not generally weaker for vices than for virtues. Constraints on vice purchases are self-imposed and strategic rather than driven by simple preferences. We suggest that rationing their vice inventories at the point of purchase allows consumers to limit subsequent consumption. As a result of purchase quantity rationing, however, vice buyers forgo savings from price reductions through quantity discounts, effectively paying price premiums for the opportunity to engage in self-control. Thus, purchase quantity rationing vice consumers are relatively price insensitive. From a managerial and public policy perspective, our findings should offer marketing practitioners in many consumer goods industries new opportunities to increase profits through segmentation and price discrimination based on consumer self-control. They can charge premium prices for small sizes of vices, relative to the corresponding quantity discounts for virtues. Virtue consumers, on the other hand, will buy larger amounts even when quantity discounts are relatively shallow. A key conceptual contribution of this paper lies in showing how marketing researchers can investigate a whole class of strategic self-constraining consumer behaviors empirically. Moreover, this research is the first to extend previous, theoretical work on impulse control by empirically demonstrating its broader implications for marketing decision making.",Intertemporal choice; Pricing policy; Product policy; Segmentation; Self-control,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses consumer self-control strategies and their implications for pricing policies, which involve long-term marketing decisions and consumer behavior analysis.

The role of public policies in reducing smoking and deaths caused by smoking in Vietnam: Results from the Vietnam tobacco policy simulation model,Levy D.T.; Bales S.; Lam N.T.; Nikolayev L.,2006,10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.043,"A simulation model is developed for Vietnam to project smoking prevalence and associated premature mortality. The model examines independently and as a package the effects of five types of tobacco control policies: tax increases, clean air laws, mass media campaigns, advertising bans, and youth access policies. Predictions suggest that the largest reductions in smoking rates will result from implementing a comprehensive tobacco control policy package. Significant inroads may be achieved through tax increases. A media campaign along with programs to publicize and enforce clean air laws, advertising bans and youth access laws would further reduce smoking rates. Tobacco control policies have the potential to make large dents in smoking rates, which in turn could lead to many lives saved. In the absence of these measures, deaths from smoking will increase. The model also helps to identify information gaps pertinent both to modeling and policymaking. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A regime-switching model of cyclical category buying,Park S.; Gupta S.,2011,10.1287/mksc.1110.0643,"In many categories consumers display cyclical buying: they repeatedly purchase in the category for several periods, followed by several periods of not buying. We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of crosscategory substitution by the consumer, caused by ""variety-seeking"" tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high versus low purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3% households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions-customized timing of price reductions. © 2011 INFORMS.",Brand choice; Endogeneity; Heterogeneity; Logit model; Random coefficients; Scanner data; Simulated maximum likelihood,,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a model for understanding consumer purchasing behavior and its implications for marketing strategies, particularly in terms of timing price promotions to enhance sales.

An empirical examination of the decision to invest in fulfillment capabilities: A study of internet retailers,Randall T.; Netessine S.; Rudi N.,2006,10.1287/mnsc.1050.0493,"Internet technology has allowed for a higher degree of decoupling between the information-intensive sales process and the physical process of inventory management than its brick-and-mortar counterpart. As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices. © 2006 INFORMS.",Bankruptcy; Econometrics; Electronic commerce; Fulfillment; Hazard model; Internet; Retailing; Supply chain management,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of inventory management decisions in relation to e-commerce strategies and the overall economic success of Internet retailers.

Sales Analysis,Eardley-Simpson J.,1974,10.1108/EUM0000000005077,"The component parts of a sale—period, product, quantity, seller, place, customer, and terms of sale—contain within themselves information relationships whose significance tends to be hidden, or lost, through over-simplification of the idea of what a ‘sale’ is.

"Developing, exploring, and validating a typology of private philanthropic decision making",Supphellen M.; Nelson M.R.,2001,10.1016/S0167-4870(01)00056-3,"Previous research on charitable giving has devoted little attention to the fundamental question of how consumers actually respond to charitable donation requests via direct mail. Specifically, researchers have relied on the untested assumption that consumers engage in fairly extensive evaluations of requests. The present research challenges this assumption. By means of a simple scenario-technique, cognitive and behavioural responses to donation requests were first elicited from a sample of 90 consumers. A qualitative constant comparative analysis of responses resulted in the discovery of three different donor categories with different styles of decision-making: analysts (ANA), relationists (REL) and internalists (INT). ANA were characterised by high involvement and thorough evaluations of both the organisation behind a request and the specific cause promoted. REL were loyal to specific organisations and seldom attended to other information than the organisation behind the request. Interestingly, consumers in the final category, INT, neither evaluated the organisation nor the cause promoted. For these consumers, recognition of the requesting organisation was usually enough to trigger a positive response. In a follow-up survey including responses from more than 400 consumers, the typology of response styles was further explored and validated. In line with predictions from study 1, significant differences were observed in the ways ANA, REL and INT perceive, evaluate and give money to charitable organisations.

It was hypothesized that providing price guarantees would reduce upward prefactual generation and reduce anticipated regret. The primary investigation supported these predictions. When price guarantees were available, prefactuals were more downward in direction and negative affect was reduced. Also, price guarantees increased long-term satisfaction and happiness even when they were not exercised.

Real-Time Evaluation of E-mail Campaign Performance,Bonfrer A.; Drèze X.,2009,10.1287/mksc.1080.0393,"We develop a testing methodology that can be used to predict the performance of e-mail marketing campaigns in real time. We propose a split-hazard model that makes use of a time transformation (a concept we call virtual time) to allow for the estimation of straightforward parametric hazard functions and generate early predictions of an individual campaign's performance (as measured by open and click propensities). We apply this pretesting methodology to 25 e-mail campaigns and find that the method is able to produce in an hour and fifteen minutes estimates that are more accurate and more reliable than those that the traditional method (doubling time) produces after 14 hours.

More or less: A model and empirical evidence on preferences for under- and overpayment in trade-in transactions,Kim J.; Rao R.S.; Kim K.; Rao A.R.,2011,10.1509/jmkr.48.1.157,"Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Analytical models; Behavioral decision theory; Consumer behavior; Pricing; Trade-ins,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses consumer preferences in trade-in transactions, which relates to decision-making processes that are more structured and target-oriented, fitting within the tactical level of marketing decisions.",10,70,15,0,5

The effect of credit on spending decisions: The role of the credit limit and credibility,Soman D.; Cheema A.,2002,10.1287/mksc.21.1.32.155,"The objective of the present research is to study consumer decisions to utilize a line of credit. The life-cycle hypothesis from economics argues that consumers should intertemporally reallocate their incomes over their life stream to maximize lifetime utility. One form of intertemporal allocation is to use past income (in the form of savings) in the future. A second form is the use of future income in the present. This can only be done if consumers have access to a temporary pool of money that they can draw from and replenish in the future - a function performed by consumer credit. However, our research reinforces prior findings that consumers are unable to correctly value their future incomes, and that they lack the cognitive capability to solve the intertemporal optimization problem required by the life-cycle hypothesis. Instead, we argue that consumers use information such as the credit limit as a signal of their future earnings potential. Specifically, if consumers have access to large amounts of credit, they are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be high and hence their willingness to use credit (and their spending) will also be high. Conversely, consumers who are granted lower amounts of credit are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be low and hence their spending will be lower. However, based on research in the area of consumer skepticism and inference making, we also argue for a moderating role of the credibility associated with the credit limit. Specifically, we argue that the above effect of credit availability would be particularly strong for consumers who believe that the credit limit credibly signals their future earnings potential (i.e., a naïve consumer who has limited experience with consumer credit). However, as consumers gain experience with credit, they start discounting credit availability as a predictor of their future and start questioning the validity of the process used to set the credit limit. Hence, with experience the effect of credit limit on the willingness to use credit should be attenuated. We test these predictions in five separate studies. In the first experimental study, we manipulate credit limit and credibility and pose subjects with a hypothetical purchase opportunity. Consistent with our prediction, credit limit impacted the propensity to spend, but only when the credibility was high. In the second experimental study, we replicate these findings even when subjects were given information about their expected future salaries, and also show that the credit limit influences their expectation of future earnings potential. In the third study, we show that the mere availability (and increase) of current liquidity cannot explain our findings. In the fourth study, we conduct a survey of consumers in which we measure a number of demographic characteristics and also ask them for their propensity to spend in a given purchase situation. In the fifth study we use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset, a triennial survey of U.S. families that is designed to provide detailed information on the use of financial services, spending behaviors, and selected demographic characteristics. Results from both studies 4 and 5 provide further support for our proposed framework-credit limits influence spending to a greater extent for consumers with lower credibility: younger consumers and less-educated consumers. Across all studies we achieved triangulation by using a variety of approaches (surveys and experiments), subjects types (young students and older consumers), nature of predictor variables (manipulated and measured), dependent measures (purchase likelihood, credit card balance, new charges), and methods of analysis (ANOVA and regression), and consistently found that increasing credit limits on a credit card increases spending, especially when the credibility of the limit is high. This paper joins a growing body of literature in marketing and behavioral decision theory that goes beyond the traditional domains of inquiry (e.g., product choice, effects of marketing mix variables) and focuses on consumer decisions relating to the appropriate use of income to finance consumption. Our framework differs from prior research on the effect of payment mechanisms on spending in two significant ways. First, we are interested in the effects of the availability of credit on spending, and not necessarily in the effect of the transaction format that is associated with each payment mechanism. Second, while prior research has studied the point-of-purchase and historic (i.e., prepurchase) effects of credit, the present research is concerned with the availability of credit in the future. Specifically, our framework is invariant to the current and prior usage of credit by the consumer.",,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The research focuses on the specific consumer decisions related to the utilization of credit and how credit limits influence spending behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",10,70,15,0,5
Market share constraints and the loss function in choice-based conjoint analysis,Gilbride T.J.; Lenk P.J.; Brazell J.D.,2008,10.1287/mksc.1080.0369,"Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be ""realistic"" in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or ""base-case"" scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base-case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base-case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because defining the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base-case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment. © 2008 INFORMS.",Bayesian decision theory; Conjoint analysis; Constrained optimization; Cross-validation; Hierarchical bayes; Loss function; Market share prediction; Penalized maximum likelihood; Posterior risk,,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporate base-case market shares into conjoint analysis, which aligns with structured decision-making processes and targets related to marketing analytics and consumer preferences.",10,70,15,0,5
Decision-making under uncertainty: Capturing dynamic brand choice processes in turbulent consumer goods markets,Erdem T.; Keane M.P.,1996,10.1287/mksc.15.1.1,"We construct two models of the behavior of consumers in an environment where there is uncertainty about brand attributes. In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ""forward-looking"" model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent. We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run. The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ""structural"" estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ""structural"" models. A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change. Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.",Advertising; Brand choice; Buyer Behavior; Choice Models; Econometric Modelling; Information Processing,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses models of consumer behavior and their implications for long-term marketing strategies, emphasizing the importance of understanding brand choice probabilities and the long-term effects of advertising.

Optimal decision making for online referral marketing,Guo Z.,2012,10.1016/j.dss.2011.09.004,"Widely available web 2.0 technologies not only bring rich and interactive user experiences, but also easily help users advertise products or services on their own blogs and social network webpages. Online referral marketing, for example, is a business practice that rewards customers who successfully refer other customers to a website or upon completion of a sale usually via their own social contacts. The referral rewards come in different forms such as shopping vouchers, redeemable points, discounts, prizes, cash payments, etc. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the business potential of incorporating an online referral marketing program into the firm's product selling strategies. Under different demand dynamics, we investigate the optimal decision making including the pricing and referral strategies to maximize the seller's profitability. We find that, under simple decision making environment such as fixed product price and myopic strategy, different demand dynamics yield the same prediction of the referral payment, which turns out to be a static policy. However, under complex market situations, both the optimal product pricing and referral offering critically depend on the demand side dynamics. Under the nonlinear demand dynamics, the referral payment is an all-or-nothing decision throughout the product selling horizon. In contrast, under the linear demand assumption, the referral payment can be partially offered in initial phase of the product introduction. We further offer some managerial insights to guide practical implementation of the online referral marketing strategy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

MOVIEMOD: An implementable decision-support system for prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures,Eliashberg J.; Jonker J.-J.; Sawhney M.S.; Wierenga B.,2000,10.1287/mksc.19.3.226.11796,"In spite of the high financial stakes involved in marketing new motion pictures, marketing science models have not been applied to the prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures. The motion picture industry poses some unique challenges. For example, the consumer adoption process for movies is very sensitive to word-of-mouth interactions, which are difficult to measure and predict before the movie has been released. In this article, we undertake the challenge to develop and implement MOVIEMOD - a prerelease market evaluation model for the motion picture industry. MOVIEMOD is designed to generate box-office forecasts and to support marketing decisions for a new movie after the movie has been produced (or when it is available in a rough cut) but before it has been released. Unlike other forecasting models for motion pictures, the calibration of MOVIEMOD does not require any actual sales data. Also, the data collection time for a product with a limited lifetime such as a movie should not take too long. For MOVIEMOD it takes only three hours in a ""consumer clinic"" to collect the data needed for the prediction of box-office sales and the evaluation of alternative marketing plans. The model is based on a behavioral representation of the consumer adoption process for movies as a macroflow process. The heart of MOVIEMOD is an interactive Markov chain model describing the macro-flow process. According to this model, at any point in time with respect to the movie under study, a consumer can be found in one of the following behavioral states: undecided, considerer, rejecter, positive spreader, negative spreader, and inactive. The progression of consumers through the behavioral states depends on a set of movie-specific factors that are related to the marketing mix, as well as on a set of more general behavioral factors that characterize the movie-going behavior in the population of interest. This interactive Markov chain model allows us to account for word-of-mouth interactions among potential adopters and several types of word-of-mouth spreaders in the population. Marketing variables that influence the transitions among the states are movie theme acceptability, promotion strategy, distribution strategy, and the movie experience. The model is calibrated in a consumer clinic experiment. Respondents fill out a questionnaire with general items related to their movie-going and movie communication behavior, they are exposed to different sets of information stimuli, they are actually shown the movie, and finally, they fill out postmovie evaluations, including word-of-mouth intentions. These measures are used to estimate the word-of-mouth parameters and other behavioral factors, as well as the movie-specific parameters of the model. MOVIEMOD produces forecasts of the awareness, adoption intention, and cumulative penetration for a new movie within the population of interest for a given base marketing plan. It also provides diagnostic information on the likely impact of alternative marketing plans on the commercial performance of a new movie. We describe two applications of MOVIEMOD: One is a pilot study conducted without studio cooperation in the United States, and the other is a full-fledged implementation conducted with cooperation of the movie's distributor and exhibitor in the Netherlands. The implementations suggest that MOVIEMOD produces reasonably accurate forecasts of box-office performance. More importantly, the model offers the opportunity to simulate the effects of alternative marketing plans. In the Dutch application, the effects of extra advertising, extra magazine articles, extra TV commercials, and higher trailer intensity (compared to the base marketing plan of the distributor) were analyzed. We demonstrate the value of these decision-support capabilities of MOVIEMOD in assisting managers to identify a final plan that resulted in an almost 50% increase in the test movie's revenue performance, compared to the marketing plan initially contemplated. Management implemented this recommended plan, which resulted in box-office sales that were within 5% of the MOVIEMOD prediction. MOVIEMOD was also tested against several benchmark models, and its prediction was better in all cases. An evaluation of MOVIEMOD jointly by the Dutch exhibitor and the distributor showed that both parties were positive about and appreciated its performance as a decision-support tool. In particular, the distributor, who has more stakes in the domestic performance of its movies, showed a great interest in using MOVIEMOD for subsequent evaluations of new movies prior to their release. Based on such evaluations and the initial validation results, MOVIEMOD can fruitfully (and inexpensively) be used to provide researchers and managers with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive audience response to new motion pictures, and it can be instrumental in developing other decision-support systems that can improve the odds of commercial success of new experiential products.",Decision support; Forecasting; Markov chains; Motion pictures; New products; Pretest market evaluation,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract describes a model (MOVIEMOD) designed for prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures, which supports marketing decisions and forecasts box-office performance.

Unlimited shelf space in Internet supply chains: Treasure trove or wasteland?,Rabinovich E.; Sinha R.; Laseter T.,2011,10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.002,"Internet retailing offers merchants limitless shelf space. This has led experts to highlight the existence of a ""long tail"" of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is ""selling less of more."" However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The time-harried shopper: Exploring the differences between maximizers and satisficers,Chowdhury T.G.; Ratneshwar S.; Mohanty P.,2009,10.1007/s11002-008-9063-0,"Schwartz and his colleagues have proposed individual differences in consumer decision goals. Maximizers are those who always strive to make the best possible decision, whereas satisficers are those who are usually willing to settle for a ""good enough"" option. In this study, we explore the influence of the maximizing trait in situations where consumers have to make quick purchase decisions. The context for our empirical study is online gift purchases made under a time constraint. The results support our predictions that maximizers (vs. satisficers) engage in more prepurchase browsing behavior and also perceive more decision time pressure. Furthermore, these effects are moderated by the size of the available choice assortment. The results also show that maximizers are more likely to change their initial time-constrained choices if given the opportunity to do so.

Determinants of Revenue-Reporting Practices for Internet Firms,Bowen R.M.; Davis A.K.; Rajgopal S.,2002,10.1506/9728-4YG8-GC3L-FPFA,"The financial press and accounting regulators (e.g., the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Accounting Standards Board) have expressed concern about pressures on Internet firms to report high levels of revenue. This study verifies the association between market capitalization and revenue, and examines economic factors that potentially influence Internet company managers' decisions to adopt allegedly aggressive revenue-recognition policies. Specifically, we examine factors hypothesized to influence the reporting of advertising barter revenue and grossed-up sales levels. We begin by providing descriptive evidence on the use of barter and grossed-up revenue across Internet sectors. Although common in some sectors, we find that the use of these accounting policies is not pervasive overall. We limit our empirical analyses to Internet companies that have the opportunity to report grossed-up or advertising barter revenue. Our cross-sectional predictions are based on both external and internal incentives to maximize revenues as well as constraints that may limit management's discretion. We predict that the following factors increase the likelihood that a firm will report grossed-up and/or barter revenue: shorter time before needing additional external financing, more active individual investor interest in the firm's stock, more active pursuit of growth via acquisitions, and greater use of stock options in employee compensation. We also posit that barter transactions might be an inexpensive way for firms to evaluate the viability of future marketing or content alliances with potential partners. Finally, we predict that constraints on management discretion are related to the reputation/quality of the firm's auditor and underwriter and the extent of management ownership. We find that firms with greater cash burn rates and higher levels of activity on Motley Fool message boards are consistently associated with barter and grossed-up revenue reporting.",,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of revenue recognition policies and their influences on Internet firms, indicating a focus on long-term organizational goals and strategies regarding financial reporting and market capitalization.",60,20,10,5,5
What people want (and how to predict It),Davenport T.H.; Harris J.G.,2009,,"Historically, neither the creators nor the distributors of cultural products such as books or movies have used analytics - data, statistics, predictive modeling - to determine the likely success of their offerings. Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation.

Optimal choice of promotional vehicles: front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives?,Zhang Z.J.; Krishna A.; Dhar S.K.,2000,10.1287/mnsc.46.3.348.12062,"We examine the key factors that influence a firm's decision whether to use front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives. When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage.

Manufacturer-specific asset investments and inter-firm governance forms: An empirical test of the contingent effect of exchange frequency,Buvik A.,2002,10.1300/J033v09n04_02,"Transaction cost analysis (TCA) keeps the frequency of exchange as a significant dimension of business-to-business transactions, and the transaction frequency is expected to influence how to align inter-firm organization efficiently. To date, transaction frequency has received little attention in empirical TCA-studies. This research focuses in particular on order frequency in industrial purchasing relationships and how it affects the alignment of purchase contracting and hierarchical governance in supplier-manufacturer relationships. Data from a survey of 160 industrial purchasing relationships supports the basic TCA prediction stating that increased transaction frequency will provide administrative economies of scale benefits under conditions with substantial hazards of trade. The empirical findings demonstrate that the association between manufacturer-specific assets and formalized purchase contracting is highly dependent on the present level of exchange frequency. In manufacturer-supplier relationships with modest exchange frequency, there is no significant association between asset specificity and contractual governance. On the other hand, the effect of manufacturer-specific assets on formalized purchase contracting was substantial in relationships with high order frequency. This governance pattern was replicated in the analysis of hierarchical governance. Substantial investments in manufacturer-specific assets enforced the manufacturer's decision control over the supplier under conditions with high exchange frequency. The research provides further insight into the economics of inter-firm organization and supports the TCA-based assumption asserting that the frequency of inter-firm exchange improves the utilization of specialized governance arrangements in business to business relationships. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Applying hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys at Parker Pen to enhance new product success,Tomkovick C.; Dobie K.E.,1995,10.1016/0737-6782(95)00028-R,"Walking the path from new product concept to successful commercialization is a tightrope act. Product developers must carefully balance a variety of factors, including predictions of consumer price sensitivity as well as which combination of product attributes will be most valued by the intended market. A well-chosen mix of analytical tools can enhance a firm's chances of accurately predicting market demand. Chuck Tomkovick and Kathryn E. Dobie describe how the integration of two product attribute assessment techniques-hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys-allows product designer to more accurately gauge price sensitivity and market receptivity to new product designs. They also describe how these analytical tools were used to improve decision-making in product development at the Parker Pen Company, and they discuss the role these tools can play in facilitating the transition from concept to commercialization. Hedonic price analysis is an econometric method for determining the value purchasers place on attributes of existing products. In product development, factorial surveys are used to identify the value members of the target market place on new product concepts and prototypes. When used in combination with identified hedonic prices, the responses to a factorial survey allow product developers to predict consumer willingness-to-pay for various combinations of new product attributes. Following development of prototypes for two new product lines, product developers at the Parker Pen Company used hedonic pricing models and factorial surveys as a means for reducing demand uncertainty and for clarifying what consumers were willing to pay for various combinations of product attributes that were under consideration. The integration and use of these techniques involved a five-step process of target market identification, product attribute identification, hedonic price estimation, administering of the factorial survey, and determination of consumer willingness-to-pay. The results of these analyses allowed Parker Pen to better focus product development efforts on those design elements for which test market customers indicated both demand and willingness-to-pay. The Parker Pen Company found hedonic pricing and factorial surveys useful for predicting both the rat and the degree of change in consumers' marginal utility for specific product attributes.

A Bayesian model to forecast new product performance in domestic and international markets,Neelamegham R.; Chintagunta P.,1999,10.1287/mksc.18.2.115,"This paper attempts to shed light on the following research questions: When a firm introduces a new product (or service) how can it effectively use the different information sources available to generate reliable new product performance forecasts? How can the firm account for varying information availability at different stages of the new product launch and generate forecasts at each stage? We address these questions in the context of the sequential launches of motion pictures in international markets. Players in the motion picture industry require forecasts at different stages of the movie launch process to aid decision-making, and the information sets available to generate such forecasts vary at different stages. Despite the importance of such forecasts, the industry struggles to understand and predict sales of new movies in domestic and overseas markets. We develop a Bayesian modeling framework that predicts first-week viewership for new movies in both domestic and several international markets. We focus on the first week because industry players involved in international markets (studios, distributors, and exhibitors) are most interested in these predictions. We draw on existing literature on forecasting performance of new movies to formulate our model. Specifically, we model the number of viewers of a movie in a given week using a Poisson count data model. The number of screens, distribution strategy, movie attributes such as genre, and presence/absence of stars are among the factors modeled to influence viewership. We employ a hierarchical Bayes formulation of the Poisson model that allows the determinants of viewership to vary across countries. We adopt the Bayesian approach for two reasons: First, it provides a convenient framework to model varying assumptions of information availability; specifically, it allows us to make forecasts by combining different sources of information such as domestic and international market-specific data. Second, this methodology provides us with the entire distribution of the new movie's performance forecast. Such a predictive distribution is more informative than a point estimate and provides a measure of the uncertainty in the forecasts. We propose a Bayesian prediction procedure that provides viewership forecasts at different stages of the new movie release process. The methodology provides forecasts under a number of information availability scenarios. Thus, forecasts can be obtained with just information from a historical database containing data on previous new product launches in several international markets. As more information becomes available, the forecasting methodology allows us to combine historical information with data on the performance of the new product in the domestic market and thereby to make forecasts with less uncertainty and greater accuracy. Our results indicate that for all the countries in the data set the number of screens on which a movie is released is the most important influence on viewership. Furthermore, we find that local distribution improves movie sales internationally in contrast to the domestic market. We also find evidence of similar genre preferences in geographically disparate countries. We find that the proposed model provides accurate forecasts at the movie-country level. Further, the model outperforms all the extant models in the marketing literature that could potentially be used for making these forecasts. A comparison of root mean square and mean absolute errors for movies in a hold out sample shows that the model that combines information available from the different sources generates the lowest errors. A Bayesian predictive model selection criterion corroborates the superior performance of this model. We demonstrate that the Bayesian model can be combined with industry rules of thumb to generate cumulative box office forecasts. In summary, this research demonstrates a Bayesian modeling framework that allows the use of different information sources to make new product forecasts in domestic and international markets. Our results underscore the theme that each movie is unique as is each country-and viewership results from an interaction of the product and the market. Hence, the motion picture industry should use both product-specific and market-specific information to make new movie performance forecasts.",Forecasting; Hierarchical Bayes; International Markets; Motion Pictures; New Products,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The paper discusses methodologies and models for generating performance forecasts for new movie releases, which align with tactical decision-making processes that translate strategic goals into specific targets and actions.",20,60,15,0,5
The value of marketing expertise,Paşa M.; Shugan S.M.,1996,10.1287/mnsc.42.3.370,"This paper has three objectives: (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model by observing how different market conditions influence whether companies emphasize marketing expertise. We accomplish these objectives as follows. First, we use decision theory to find an expression for the expected value of marketing expertise. We do not use decision-analysis in the normative tradition. Nor do we assume that firms actually use formal decision-analysis. Rather, we assume that firms are rational and that decision theory describes their actions. Given that assumption, we predict how firms should evaluate marketing. Here, marketing expertise helps a firm make better marketing decisions (at least on average). Hence, the value of marketing expertise increases as marketing decisions become more important. Second, consistent with decision theory, we predict that marketing decisions become more important with increases in the instability of the marketing environment (i.e., predictability), the profit impact of marketing decisions (i.e., opportunity profit), and the loss from marketing mistakes (i.e., potential loss). Third, we construct empirical measures of our theoretical constructs with data from 592 firms. Our empirical results are consistent with our predictions and reveal factors influencing the value of marketing expertise.

The Truth is Out There!

This model defines an individual's attitude about a particular college or university as the importance the individual attaches to a specific attribute of the school, and the belief that the institution under consideration possesses that attribute. In this study we extend the model by investigating the importance of applicants' attitudes about competitor institutions, and by controlling for demographic and ability factors that may affect attitudes. Our research demonstrates that attitudes have a significant, positive relationship to enrollment decisions. As well, we incorporate an attitude difference measure that contrasts applicants' attitudes about one institution compared to admissions competitors.

'You should buy this one!' The influence of online recommendations on product attitudes and choice confidence,Harris J.; Gupta P.,2008,10.1504/IJEMR.2008.019816,"We use a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) in the form of online customer-to-customer recommendations on attitudes about the recommended product and confidence in the choice decision. Specifically, we manipulate the number of consumer recommendations and measure motivation to process information in a realistic online shopping environment. Consistent with predictions of dual information processing theories, we find that the amount of eWOM has a significant impact on buyer confidence in product choice. In addition, we find that for buyers less motivated to process information, the effect of eWOM on their choice confidence is mediated by their attitude towards the recommended product, suggesting that the amount of eWOM functions as a purchase cue.

Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to entry in different competitive game structures: Theoretical analysis and empirical illustration,Shankar V.,1997,10.1287/mksc.16.3.271,"Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to new entries are recognized as important determinants of the outcome of pioneer-late mover competition, particularly in price-inelastic markets such as those for pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, and luxury goods. Managers in such markets are interested in better understanding when to accommodate (i.e., decrease marketing spending) or retaliate (i.e., increase spending) in nonprice marketing variables such as advertising and salesforce. In addition, the reallocation of marketing resources toward advertising (indicated by a pull strategy) or salesforce (indicated by a push strategy) upon entry is strategically important to managers. Previous theoretical research shows that pioneers should retaliate in both static and growing markets. Results from empirical research are mixed in that they support both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets. Empirical research also shows that a pioneer accommodates (retaliates) with its low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Contrary to prior research, however, some pioneers have successfully accommodated late movers in growing markets, and in some cases, have accommodated with their stronger marketing mix variables and also retaliated with their weaker marketing mix variables. For example, Bristol Myers Squibb's Capoten accommodated the entry of Merck's Vasotec in the growing ace-inhibitors market with its more powerful variable, salesforce, but also retaliated with its less potent variable, advertising. Moreover, not much is known about how the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should change (i.e., toward pull vs. push strategies) in response to new entries. We seek to better explain the pioneer's reactions and predict its shift in marketing mix allocation upon new entry. We note that prior research's predictions on the pioneer's reactions are based on a limited number of key factors such as product-market characteristics and the pioneer's elasticities prior to a new entry. In this paper, we extend previous research by adding two other critical factors, namely, the impact of new entry on the pioneer's elasticities and margin, and different competitive game structures to better predict and explain the pioneer's reactions. We develop analytical results on the pioneer's reactions in price, advertising, and salesforce in different competitive games (both Nash and different leader-follower games). In these results we identify the conditions under which the pioneer should accommodate, or retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift its marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies. We empirically illustrate some of the analytical results using data from a pharmaceutical category. We show that a pioneer who adopts a follower (leader) role with respect to a marketing mix variable in a static (growing) market, and witnesses a decrease (an increase) in own elasticity and margin upon a new entry, generally should accommodate (retaliate) in that variable. However, we are also able to show that there are cases where these general reactions don't hold. Thus, for example, it is possible for a pioneer to find it optimal to accommodate in a growing market or to retaliate even when its elasticity decreases upon entry, depending on the combination of competitive game, the impact of entry on elasticities and margin, and market growth. In this way, our results point to the fact that it is necessary to look not only at one factor at a time, but instead examine the combination of all the factors. We explain the empirical support for both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets by showing that the pioneer should accommodate (retaliate) a late mover with its competitively low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Competitively high (low) elasticity variables are not (are) likely to be significantly reduced by a new entry in the anticipated competitive game. With regard to reallocation of the pioneer's marketing mix, we show that the change in the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should follow the change in the relative marketing mix effectiveness after new entry. This, in turn, depends on the structure of competition, the impact of the late mover on its elasticities and margins, and the competitor's marketing mix elasticities, in addition to own elasticities. The results can guide managers on how factors such as competitive structure, changes in elasticities and margin, and market growth impact the pioneer's marketing mix decisions, and on when to accommodate, retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies.",Competitive Strategy; Defensive Strategy; Econometric Models; Game Theory; Marketing Mix; Resource Allocation Policy,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the strategic implications of pioneers' marketing mix reactions to new entrants in the market, particularly how these reactions affect long-term competitive positioning and resource allocation in response to market dynamics.",60,25,10,0,5

Design/methodology/approach - The study involved collection of information and data from the literature and the Norwegian oil and gas (O&G) industry. A survey was conducted to get an overview of existing practices and guided interviews were conducted to confirm the findings of the survey. Findings - The study indicates that the market needs are considered the most important innovation process driver, feedback from the customers is the most important activity to encourage service innovations, whilst return on investments is the most important decision-making factor in evaluating innovation feasibility. Employees are the most important source of innovation ideas. Furthermore, interactions between different companies, as well as involvement of customer, employees and suppliers in the innovation process are becoming increasingly important. Practical implications - The study shows that service providers and receivers often collaborate in the innovation processes, and that many of the activities are performed simultaneously. This results in the collaborative parties needing to put resources on managing and coordinating the innovation process in a structured, effective and efficient way. The proposed framework for service innovation management and coordination provides practitioners with a structured approach to manage industrial service innovations.

Pricing decisions under demand uncertainty: A Bayesian mixture model approach,Kalyanam K.,1996,10.1287/mksc.15.3.207,"The advent of optical scanning devices and decreases in the cost of computing power have made it possible to assemble databases with sales and marketing mix information in an accurate and timely manner. These databases enable the estimation of demand functions and pricing/promotion decisions in ""real"" time. Commercial suppliers of marketing research like A. C. Nielsen and IRI are embedding estimated demand functions in promotion planning and pricing tools for brand managers and retailers. This explosion in the estimation and use of demand functions makes it timely and appropriate to re-examine several fundamental issues. In particular, demand functions are latent theoretical constructs whose exact parametric form is unknown. Estimates of price elasticities, profit maximizing prices, interbrand competition and other policy implications are conditional on the parametric form assumed in estimation. In practice, many forms may be found that are not only theoretically plausible but also consistent with the data. The different forms could suggest different profit maximizing prices leaving it unclear as to what is the appropriate pricing action. Specification tests may lack the power to resolve this uncertainty, particularly for non-nested comparisons. Also, the structure of these tests does not permit seamless integration of estimation, specification analysis and optimal pricing into a unified framework. As an alternative to the existing approaches, I propose a Bayesian mixture model (BMM) that draws on Bayesian estimation, inference, and decision theory, thereby providing a unified framework. The BMM approach consists of input, estimation, diagnostic and optimal pricing modules. In the input module, alternate parametric models of demand are specified along with priors. Utility structures representing the decision maker's attitude towards risk can be explicitly specified. In the estimation module, the inputs are combined with data to compute parameter estimates and posterior probabilities for the models. The diagnostic module involves testing the statistical assumptions underlying the models. In the optimal pricing module the estimates and posterior probabilities are combined with the utility structure to arrive at optimal pricing decisions. Formalizing demand uncertainty in this manner has many important payoffs. While the classical approaches emphasize choosing a demand specification, the BMM approach emphasizes constructing an objective function that represents a mixture of the specifications. Hence, pricing decisions can be arrived at even when there is no consensus among the different parametric specifications. The pricing decisions will reflect parametric demand uncertainty, and hence be more robust than those based on a single demand model. The BMM approach was empirically evaluated using store level scanner data. The decision context was the determination of equilibrium wholesale prices in a noncooperative game between several leading national brands. Retail demand was parametrized as semilog and doublelog with diffuse priors for the models and the parameters. Wholesale demand functions were derived by incorporating the retailers' pricing behavior in the retail demand function. Utility functions reflecting risk averse and risk neutral decision makers were specified. The diagnostic module confirms that face validity measures, residual analysis, classical tests or holdout predictions were unable to resolve the uncertainty about the parametric form and by implication the uncertainty with regard to pricing decisions. In contrast, the posterior probabilities were more conclusive and favored the specification that predicted better in a holdout analysis. However, across the brands, they lacked a systematic pattern of updating towards any one specification. Also, none of the priors updated to zero or one, and there was considerable residual uncertainty about the parametric specification. Despite the residual uncertainty, the BMM approach was able to determine the equilibrium wholesale prices. As expected, specifications influence the BMM pricing solutions in accordance with their posterior probabilities which act as weights. In addition, differing attitudes towards risk lead to considerable divergence in the pricing actions of the risk averse and the risk neutral decision maker. Finally, results from a Monte Carlo experiment suggest that the BMM approach performs well in terms of recovering potential improvements in profits.",Bayesian econometrics; Decision theory; Demand structures; Nonnested models; Pricing; Regression; Scanner data,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the development of a Bayesian mixture model for estimating demand functions and making pricing decisions, which aligns with long-term strategic goals of organizations in marketing and pricing strategy.",60,25,10,0,5
Multiple generation product life cycle predictions using a novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method,Huang C.-Y.; Tzeng G.-H.,2008,10.1016/j.techfore.2007.07.005,"Product life cycle (PLC) prediction plays a crucial role in strategic planning and policy definition for high-technology products. Forecast methodologies which can predict PLCs accurately can help to achieve successful strategic decision-making, forecasting, and foresight activities in high-technology firms, research institutes, governments, and universities. Over the past few decades, even though analytic framework strategies have been proposed for production, marketing, R&D (research and development), and finance, aiming at each stage of PLCs, forecast methodologies with which to predict PLCs are few. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel forecast methodology to allow for predictions of product life time (PLT) and the annual shipment of products during the entire PLC of multiple generation products. A novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, the product life-time of the specific generation to be analyzed will be predicted by the fuzzy piecewise regression line that is derived based upon the product life-time of earlier generations. In the second stage of the forecast methodology, the annual shipment of products of the specified generation will be predicted by deriving annual fuzzy regression lines for each generation, based upon the historical data on the earlier generations' products. An empirical study predicting the life-time and the annual shipment of the 16 Mb (Mega bit) DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) PLC is illustrated to validate the analytical process. The results demonstrate that two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis can predict multiple generation PLT and PLC precisely, thereby serving as a foundation for future strategic planning, policy definitions and foresights. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Sales forecasting in high-technology markets: A utility-based approach,Decker R.; Gnibba-Yukawa K.,2010,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2009.00703.x,"Accurate sales projections are of vital importance to the profitability and long-term survival of high-tech companies. This is especially true in the growth stage of product innovation, because major investments and marketing decisions are made in this phase. By examining recent empirical studies focusing on consumer behavior in high-technology markets, several factors are identified that can affect individual buying decisions and aggregate sales, namely, interpersonal communication, democratization of innovation, direct and indirect network effects, forward-looking behavior, and consumer heterogeneity. Against this background the diffusion-modeling and the utility-based approach are reviewed in terms of their basic conception and their applicability to the markets concerned. Based on this investigation a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, specifically in the growth stage, is developed. The model has a utility-theoretic background and a logistic structure. Since data are scarce in this early stage of the product life cycle two versions of the new approach are discussed, an extended version considering forward-looking behavior and a more parsimonious (""myopic"") one. The performance of the new model is demonstrated using real sales data on the CD player, the DVD player/recorder, and the digital camera market. The empirical comparisons include alternative specifications of the Bass diffusion model as well as a proportional hazard model and consist of two steps. First, the models are checked as to whether they are able to represent the sales data at all. It is shown that both versions of the proposed model are at least equivalent, if not superior, to the models used as benchmarks in terms of fit. In the next step, the models are applied to predict future sales in the three markets. The resulting forecasts show that the proposed model performs significantly better than its benchmarks. Its parsimony enables reliable predictions, even in cases, where only short time series are available for parameter estimation. The model is able to anticipate decreasing diffusion rates as they occur at the end of the growth stage and, thus, helps to avoid overoptimistic sales forecasts, which may cause severe economic damages. The new approach is easy to calibrate and can be applied without specialized econometric expertise. © 2009 Product Development & Management Association.",,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, which is essential for long-term planning and decision-making in high-tech companies.

Fashion change and fashion consumption: The chaotic perspective,Ming Law K.; Zhang Z.-M.; Leung C.-S.,2004,10.1108/13612020410559966,"Previous researches have considered that the impact of fashion change and fashion consumption is linear. Therefore, one reason was found as the ultimate source to explain why a fashion style/ trend was spread to the mass market. However, the existing market is complex and difficult to find out the holistic reason to explain fashion consumption. In this study, the chaotic perspective is taken into account to investigate the relationship between fashion change and fashion consumption. By using the grounded theory method, 33 in-depth interviews were conducted. A chaotic fashion consumption model is developed from the findings to explain how different fashions are consumed and rejected while fashion changes. It is found that the interaction of being fashionable, perceived fashionability and system participation affects the ultimate decision on fashion consumption. It is also found that a pattern can be traced to forecast the degree of fashion consumption even when the fashion change phenomenon is chaotic. Thus, it is similar to the principle of chaos theory that short-term prediction is possible in relation to the degree of fashion acceptance among consumers.

Expression of green marketing developing the conception of corporate social responsibility; [žaliojo marketingo raiška plėtojant įmonių socialinės atsakomybės koncepciją],Banyte J.; Brazioniene L.; Gadeikiene A.,2010,,"Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and ""clean"" products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions.

Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise - consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.",Corporate social responsibility; Green consumer; Green marketing; Lithuanian market of ecofriendly food products,Kauno Technologijos Universitetas,scopus-prediction,Strategic,The abstract discusses the long-term implications of changing consumer preferences towards eco-friendly products and the integration of corporate social responsibility into marketing strategies.

Brand positivity and competitive effects on the evaluation of brand extensions,Kapoor H.; Heslop L.A.,2009,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2009.05.001,"The dominant approach in brand-extension research has focused on the role of fit in the extension evaluation process. Overemphasis on fit has resulted in research designs that involve singular evaluation of the extension without considering how competing brands in the target category might affect the evaluation of brand extensions. Singular evaluations are known to result in brand positivity effects; that is, brand extensions are evaluated more favorably than is warranted. This research finds that singular evaluations do indeed lead to brand positivity effects. However, brand positivity effects are mitigated when respondents were provided with competitive information along with target-category structure and comparative/non-comparative brand positioning statements. Results also suggest that parent brand-extension fit, though an important determinant of an extension's assessment, plays a less critical role in a comparative evaluation context when an extension's brand strength is accounted for in relation to its competition in the target category. Therefore, the findings stress the importance of both competition and parent-brand fit in making informed positioning decisions and more realistic predictions of extension success. The research demonstrates when, how and to what extent comparative evaluations result in lower extension ratings and provides managerial strategies to introduce an extension effectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Complexity effects in choice experiment-based models,Dellaert B.G.C.; Donkers B.; Van Soest A.,2012,10.1509/jmr.09.0315,"Many firms rely on choice experiment-based models to evaluate future marketing actions under various market conditions.

A practical review of electroencephalography’s value to consumer research,McInnes A.N.; Sung B.; Hooshmand R.,2023,10.1177/14707853221112622,"Electroencephalography (EEG) offers insights into the neural responses of consumers to marketing stimuli which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such stimuli in directing favorable consumer behavior in real-world settings. This practical review provides guidelines for using EEG in consumer and marketing research. It provides recommendations for how EEG may effectively be employed in neuromarketing in the future. EEG requires careful experimental design, and as such, we outline current recommendations for the collection, processing, analysis, and interpretation of EEG evoked potentials (i.e., event related potentials; ERP) and spectral content (i.e., EEG frequency). By providing an introductory overview of EEG measures in marketing and consumer research, this practical review extends previous literature that is primarily focused on other neuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging) and other disciplines (e.g., economics and organizational behaviour). Furthermore, by reviewing how EEG has been used throughout psychophysiological and neuromarketing research, we provide recommendations on how EEG can be used to measure marketing-related outcomes.

Paralysis by Inertia “Like” Habit in Social Networking Services: Tendency to Answer Loyalty Questions in Marketing Surveys,Kato T.,2023,10.1177/21582440231174159,"Factors affecting survey quality, such as questionnaire length, screen design, incentives for respondents, and answering devices have been extensively researched before. This study introduces a new dimension to the factors of response bias’ factors and focuses on the possibility that Like habits and motives in social networking services (SNS) may lower the psychological barrier to favorable reactions for brand loyalty (e.g., recommendation intention). Propensity score was applied to the results of Japanese smartphone users’ online survey, and the effect of Like habits on response tendencies was verified. Results show that compared to the group that did not use SNS, there were no differences with those who used true Likes, and a group of inertia Like has a high score—becoming clear that the psychological barriers differ depending on Like motive.

The Power of Personal Connections in Micro-Influencer Marketing: A Study on Consumer Behaviour and the Impact of Micro-Influencers,Gerlich M.,2023,10.58262/tmj.v11i1.1010,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, influencer marketing has snowballed into a big phenomenon when businesses around the world are trying to use influencers to promote their products and services. However, even though influencer marketing is a craze in the market, the engagement rate and conversion rates of micro-influencers with a smaller size of followers are higher than that of celebrities and mega influencers. It is important to understand the reasons why certain influencers are successful and others are not. Past research mainly focuses on micro-influencers as one group but does not differentiate between micro-influencers who are known personally by their followers and those who are not personally known. This is important as consumers are sceptical towards the product promotion not only of mega-influencers because they believe that influencers, in general, are using their base of followers to promote a product or service for money and fame. Therefore, consumers trust the words and opinions of micro-influencers, who provide information based on their own experience and expertise. It is worth investigating the underlying reason for the success of these micro and nano influencers. Is it the personal connection with the follower? Is it the engagement rate and the choice of products and recommendations? These are some of the points that have been investigated in this research. The objective of this research paper was to explore if followers who share a relationship with or know the micro-influencers personally make their purchase decisions based on the recommendations provided by the influencers. The research findings highlighted that when micro-influencers are known to their followers on a personal level, they wield more persuasive power over their followers. © 2023 Oxbridge Publishing House Ltd UK",consumer behaviour; digital marketing; influencer marketing; marketing; micro-influencer; social media marketing,Transnational Press London Ltd,scopus-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of micro-influencers in marketing, particularly their personal connections with followers and how this affects purchase decisions.

Such developments suggest the need to determine whether the effects of virtual influencers on consumer decisions differ from those of human influencers, depending on the type of product they are promoting. With a 2 (virtual vs. human influencer) × 2 (utilitarian vs. hedonic product) experimental design, using Instagram influencer posts and data from 275 participants, the current research establishes that the type of influencer does not affect intentions to adopt recommendations. But the influence process varies by type of influencer: Virtual influencers’ recommendations appear more useful, especially for utilitarian products, but consumers identify more with human influencers’ posts. Both usefulness and identification increase intention to adopt influencers’ recommendation. Overall, these results suggest that, while virtual influencers should endorse utilitarian products, human influencers should be hired to endorse hedonic products. © 2023 The Author(s)",Behavioral intention; Human influencer; Identification; Type of product; Usefulness; Virtual influencer,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-recommendation,Tactical,"The research examines the effectiveness of different types of influencers in marketing campaigns, focusing on how they impact consumer decision-making based on product type.

Evaluating strategies for promoting retail mobile channel using a hidden Markov model,Chen J.; Rao V.R.,2023,10.1016/j.jretai.2022.07.001,"With the proliferation of mobile communication technology, many firms, including retailers and consumer banks, are making efforts to develop mobile platforms to better engage with their customers and reduce operational costs. However, the cost advantage of these mobile technologies will not yield fruition unless the mobile channel accounts for a significant share of total transactions. In this article, we explore potential options for firms to promote usage of the mobile channel. To achieve this, we propose a hidden Markov model to both model customers’ decisions and assess different managerial strategies through simulations. While we apply our proposed model to data from a leading financial institution, our approach is equally applicable to other retail settings. The results show that customers’ choices of services and channels are sensitive to process time by type of channel. A 10% increase in process time through non-mobile channels leads to a nearly 14% increase in utilization of mobile banking channel. Therefore, retailing firms could potentially influence customers’ choice of different channels by changing channel-specific process times. Motivated by these findings, we present and compare performances across five different policies, in promoting the usage of mobile channel. Drawing on our simulation results, we also make personalized policy recommendations to firms facing different levels of financial constraints. For those with financial constraints, we recommend a policy of increasing process time for a selected subset of service requests through non-mobile channels. Firms not constrained by the resources might be better off improving process time with the mobile channel by targeting customers identified as having a better relationship with the firm. © 2022 New York University",Customer relationship management; Digital marketing; Hidden Markov model; Mobile channel,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses specific managerial strategies and policies that firms can implement to promote the usage of mobile channels, which aligns with tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",10,70,15,0,5
Understanding digitally enabled complex networks: a plural granulation based hybrid community detection approach,Gupta S.; Deodhar S.,2024,10.1108/ITP-10-2020-0682,"Purpose: Communities representing groups of agents with similar interests or functions are one of the essential features of complex networks. Finding communities in real-world networks is critical for analyzing complex systems in various areas ranging from collaborative information to political systems. Given the different characteristics of networks and the capability of community detection in handling a plethora of societal problems, community detection methods represent an emerging area of research. Contributing to this field, the authors propose a new community detection algorithm based on the hybridization of node and link granulation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed algorithm utilizes a rough set-theoretic concept called closure on networks. Initial sets are constructed by using neighborhood topology around the nodes as well as links and represented as two different categories of granules. Subsequently, the authors iteratively obtain the constrained closure of these sets. The authors use node mutuality and link mutuality as merging criteria for node and link granules, respectively, during the iterations. Finally, the constrained closure subsets of nodes and links are combined and refined using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and a local density function to obtain communities in a binary network. Findings: Extensive experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks followed by a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research limitations/implications: The study also contributes to the ongoing effort related to the application of soft computing techniques to model complex systems. The extant literature has integrated a rough set-theoretic approach with a fuzzy granular model (Kundu and Pal, 2015) and spectral clustering (Huang and Xiao, 2012) for node-centric community detection in complex networks. In contributing to this stream of work, the proposed algorithm leverages the unexplored synergy between rough set theory, node granulation and link granulation in the context of complex networks. Combined with experiments of network datasets from various domains, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal co-occurring disjoint, overlapping and nested communities without necessarily assigning each node to a community. Practical implications: This study carries important practical implications for complex adaptive systems in business and management sciences, in which entities are increasingly getting organized into communities (Jacucci et al., 2006). The proposed community detection method can be used for network-based fraud detection by enabling experts to understand the formation and development of fraudulent setups with an active exchange of information and resources between the firms (Van Vlasselaer et al., 2017). Products and services are getting connected and mapped in every walk of life due to the emergence of a variety of interconnected devices, social networks and software applications. Social implications: The proposed algorithm could be extended for community detection on customer trajectory patterns and design recommendation systems for online products and services (Ghose et al., 2019; Liu and Wang, 2017). In line with prior research, the proposed algorithm can aid companies in investigating the characteristics of implicit communities of bloggers or social media users for their services and products so as to identify peer influencers and conduct targeted marketing (Chau and Xu, 2012; De Matos et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). The proposed algorithm can be used to understand the behavior of each group and the appropriate communication strategy for that group. For instance, a group using a specific language or following a specific account might benefit more from a particular piece of content than another group. The proposed algorithm can thus help in exploring the factors defining communities and confronting many real-life challenges. Originality/value: This work is based on a theoretical argument that communities in networks are not only based on compatibility among nodes but also on the compatibility among links. Building up on the aforementioned argument, the authors propose a community detection method that considers the relationship among both the entities in a network (nodes and links) as opposed to traditional methods, which are predominantly based on relationships among nodes only. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cohesion; Community; Decision support; IT artifact; Network analysis; Social computing,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a community detection algorithm that has practical implications for marketing, networking, and customer engagement.

Consumer-side fairness in recommender systems: a systematic survey of methods and evaluation,Vassøy B.; Langseth H.,2024,10.1007/s10462-023-10663-5,"In the current landscape of ever-increasing levels of digitalization, we are facing major challenges pertaining to data volume. Recommender systems have become irreplaceable both for helping users navigate the increasing amounts of data and, conversely, aiding providers in marketing products to interested users. Data-driven models are susceptible to data bias, materializing in the bias influencing the models’ decision-making. For recommender systems, such issues are well exemplified by occupation recommendation, where biases in historical data may lead to recommender systems relating one gender to lower wages or to the propagation of stereotypes. In particular, consumer-side fairness, which focuses on mitigating discrimination experienced by users of recommender systems, has seen a vast number of diverse approaches. The approaches are further diversified through differing ideas on what constitutes fair and, conversely, discriminatory recommendations. This survey serves as a systematic overview and discussion of the current research on consumer-side fairness in recommender systems. To that end, a novel taxonomy based on high-level fairness definitions is proposed and used to categorize the research and the proposed fairness evaluation metrics.

Gastronomic Curiosity and Consumer Behavior: The Impact of Television Culinary Programs on Choices of Food Services,Gajdzik B.; Jaciow M.; Wolniak R.; Wolny R.,2024,10.3390/foods13010115,"In highly developed countries, more and more people use culinary services. Cooking at home, for the family, is giving way to culinary services. Consumers either order food home or use the offers of restaurants and bars. Consumers’ choice of culinary form may be influenced by cooking television programs. Many TV stations broadcast cooking programs. This study examined the impact of television culinary programs on consumer behavior in the restaurant services market. The article examines the interplay of emotional responses, personality traits, and culinary preferences to understand how TV cooking programs influence dining decisions. The study was conducted using the CAWI method, which involved 742 respondents. The study, conducted between May 2021 and April 2022, was addressed to people who visited restaurants presented in the Polish culinary TV show titled “Kitchen Revolutions”. The study revealed that almost 3/4 of the respondents chose restaurants based on the program’s recommendations. Although there was a strong emotional connection with this program—nearly half of the respondents expressed delight in the taste of snacks and main courses—this did not always translate into an increased frequency of eating meals away from home. Only every third respondent said that the program influenced their gastronomic behavior. The research hypotheses examined the extent to which culinary TV shows influence the frequency of visits to restaurants, the perceived quality of life, and the influence on consumers with specific personality traits. The results partially supported the hypothesis that cooking programs on television encourage people to eat out more often, but the perceived impact on quality of life and on some personality traits was less clear. The article contributes to the understanding of consumer behavior in the food service market by highlighting the complex dynamics of emotional reactions, personality traits, and the impact of culinary television programs.

Factors Contributing to Online or In-store Shopping among Academics from a Private Higher Education Institution in South Africa,Moodley M.; Naidoo S.,2023,10.32479/irmm.14732,"The aim of the study was to determine the factors contributing to online or in-store shopping behaviour among academics from a private higher education institution in South Africa. In addition, the study examined types of products or services consumers are likely to purchase in-store and online and particular aspects relating to store atmosphere, as well as the challenges that were experienced using both modes of shopping. The study was conducted at a private higher education institution. A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among all the academics in the organisation. The study show that the majority of respondents belonged to generation X and Y and that they are more inclined to purchase from both in-store and online stores rather than a singular mode of shopping. However, there is an element of fear, anxiety and uncertainty that customers face when purchasing online. This is motivated by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model. Factors that influence the overall purchasing decision for both online and in-store shopping include accessibility, convenience, delivery service, store aesthetics (atmosphere and ambience) and the availability of an assistant. Recommendations for retail marketing managers include the fact that they should consider a hybrid model of both in-store and online shopping.

Survey of screw-retained versus cement-retained implant restorations used in both education and private dental practices,Found A.A.; Shah S.; Fouda M.A.; Santos M.J.M.C.; Butler S.,2024,10.1002/jdd.13568,"Aims: In the literature, it is still unclear if the decisions for selecting the type of implant crown-retaining system are based on scientific-based research or if the Universities’ choices, Implant marketing trends, or finances could have a major influence on the private dentists’ decisions. Objectives: Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the crown-retaining system (cement- or screw-retained) used in dental schools and private dental practices. Methods: A 13-item questionnaire was sent to Canadian dental schools (n = 10) and dental offices in London (n = 298), Canada. The questionnaire included demographic questions and questions to reveal the dentists’ perspectives on prosthetic implant treatment between the two-retaining systems. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression (p = 0.05). Results: Twenty-four private dentists and five dental schools responded to the survey – 62.5% of private practitioners and 60% of universities reported using both systems. A trend was observed in using screw-retained systems by dentists who graduated 5–10 years ago. Straumann, Astra, and Nobel Biocare were the private practices and dental schools’ preferred implant systems. The use of platform switching for all cases was selected by 54.2% of the private practitioners and 40% of the dental schools. Resin cement was the private practice's preferred cementation method; the dental schools used glass ionomer and zinc phosphate cement. The multinomial logistic regressions showed no statistical difference between the crown-retaining system chosen and the decision factors. The laboratory technician's recommendations and cost influenced the decision-making process for private dentists. For the universities, perio-restorative outcome, implant position, survival rates, institute preferences, and evidence-based research influenced the crown-retaining system's decision-making process. Conclusion: The Canadian dental schools and private practice reported using both screw- and cement-retaining systems. However, there was a difference in the selection criteria as the universities showed a tendency towards a more research-based approach in their decision, while for the private practices, the technicians’ recommendations and cost played a major role in the decision process.

However, the legislation and regulations are specific to product categories and legal jurisdictions, thus impeding one's ability to understand what a recall is and isn’t, and how it differs from related phenomena (e.g., product-harm crisis). The authors aim to provide such an understanding. They reviewed 510 reports from academics, managers, governments, and regulators; conducted interviews with 25 practitioners; and used 10 recall data sets to identify seven fundaments of recall. They synthesize the fundaments to propose a definition and a decision tree of recall, which can help inform academics, journalists, managers, lawyers, and safety advocates regarding what term is appropriate in what context. The authors apply the fundaments to identify similarities and differences between a recall and a harm crisis, the term used frequently in marketing research in association with recall.

The role of industry analysts in spreading WOM in B2B,Cowan K.; Palo T.; Chapple D.; Zhang Y.,2023,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0127,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address these questions. Word-of-mouth (WOM) is increasingly important in business-to-business (B2B) decision-making. Yet, research on this topic is rather limited, and often borrows from business-to-consumer (B2C) WOM literature. The question remains as to whether these assumptions realistically occur in B2B WOM. Specifically, this study explores the following questions: What value does B2B WOM have? Why do social media influencers in B2B engage in WOM? What type(s) of social media influencers spread WOM in B2B? Design/methodology/approach: To address these questions, this study adopts a qualitative research strategy. This study focuses on industry analysts in information technology markets who often influence the buying decisions of customers through their expertise and recommendations of technology solutions. Based on interviews with these influencers, this study explicates B2B WOM, an area the authors know much less of in comparison to B2C WOM. Findings: This study reveals differences in who spreads WOM within B2B, their roles, key features of their content and how they spread WOM. Second, this study demonstrates the types of actors spreading WOM in B2B in relation to the type of WOM and how it actually influences B2B markets. Originality/value: This study broadens the current definition of WOM and, specifically, showcases WOM not only as amplifying messages but as a means to co-create the market itself with vendors and clients. This research offers several contributions to the B2B WOM literature and influencer practice. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business-to-business; Influencer marketing; Market creation; Opinion leadership; Social media influencer; Thought leadership; Word-of-mouth,Emerald Publishing,scopus-recommendation,Strategic,"The study addresses the long-term implications of word-of-mouth (WOM) in B2B contexts, exploring its value, the role of social media influencers, and their impact on decision-making processes.

Intersectionality and urban mobility: A systematic review on gender differences in active transport uptake,Yuan Y.; Masud M.; Chan H.; Chan W.; Brubacher J.R.,2023,10.1016/j.jth.2023.101572,"Background: Active transport has numerous environmental and health benefits. However, these benefits are not evenly distributed across the population because its utilization is strongly linked to a person's socioeconomic and cultural factors. Through the lens of intersectionality, this systematic review analyzed how gender and its interactions with other socioeconomic and cultural factors influence a person's decision to utilize active transport in urban settings. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the authors screened 1,993 titles and abstracts that were published between January 2000 and December 2021. Twenty-one articles were included for data extraction and synthesis. Results: A person's decision to walk or cycle is highly contextual. In general, women with lower socioeconomic status tend to walk more out of necessity. Women with higher socioeconomic status, higher education level, more free time, and access to safe and convenient infrastructure tend to cycle more. Gendered social and cultural factors might also deter some women from active transport. The following recommendations may attract more people to walk or cycle for transportation: developing community-based programs that empower girls and women to cycle; building a safe environment that protects all vulnerable road users; creating media and social marketing campaigns that shift the cultural narratives around active transport; designing neighourhoods with higher mixed land usage; and advocating for gender and income equality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Active transportation; Gender; Intersectionality; Socioeconomic status,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation,Out of scope,"The abstract discusses the impact of socioeconomic and cultural factors on active transport, specifically in relation to gender.

Thought experiments: Review and recommendations,Aguinis H.; Beltran J.R.; Archibold E.E.; Jean E.L.; Rice D.B.,2023,10.1002/job.2658,"Thought experiments have been used as an effective methodological approach to advance theory in numerous scientific fields. However, they are underutilized in organizational behavior (OB) and adjacent fields. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive and multidisciplinary literature review of thought experiments that entailed 174 sources in economics, psychology, marketing, medicine, sociology, finance, and other fields. We used insights from this literature review to define and describe the unique nature of thought experiments and offer a taxonomy of four main types based on a theory's development stage (i.e., early vs. late) and a study's theoretical goal (i.e., confirmation vs. disconfirmation). We also provide a decision-making tree useful for evaluating whether conducting a thought experiment is beneficial for a particular research situation and which of the four types is most likely to produce a meaningful contribution. Then, we offer best-practice recommendations for conducting thought experiments that address how to plan, execute, report results, and discuss implications. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of thought experiments by using the best-practice recommendations to design and conduct a thought experiment in the domain of workplace allyship. Finally, we offer suggestions for future substantive research that would benefit from thought experiment methodology (i.e., diversity, equity, and inclusion; leadership; performance; selection and recruitment; teams; and turnover).

By using Multiple Criteria Decision Making focused on three groups of key performance indicators: External, specifics of the Industry, and Users, the study aims to provide a comprehensive review of retail location selection within the emerging paradigm of mixed-use environments. The assessment reveals that connectivity, specifically with metro stations within 500 m, is paramount to a project’s success. Moreover, 73% of the projects surveyed feature more than two underground levels, with the top 10 ranking projects boasting 3–4 floors above ground, occupied by both offices and retail spaces. Structurally, almost 90% of the mixed-use developments being studied have commercial areas exceeding 35,000 sqm. The optimal project size is determined to be around 200,000 sqm, with retail making up half of the built area. The preferred land plot size ranges from 35,000 to 40,000 sqm. However, the study also identifies a lack of comprehensive sustainability strategies and net-zero carbon certifications in many of these developments. The findings also contribute to urban researchers and policymakers by offering a multi-criteria matrix to assess and scale mixed-use developments, not only in Shanghai but also in other geographical locations.

The dissemination and impacts of deceptive eWOM: a dynamic process perspective,Shih C.-F.; Huang S.-L.; Huang H.-C.,2023,10.1080/0144929X.2022.2063759,"To minimise risk, consumers seek out eWOM, recommendations, and reviews from others before making purchasing decisions. However, it is not uncommon to see companies masterminding deceptive eWOM, disguising promotional messages as user-generated product reviews to attract and retain consumers. The extant literature is extremely limited regarding deceptive eWOM and its long-term effects. Ours is the first longitudinal study to examine consumers’ belief and attitude changes in the context of deceptive eWOM. This study found that, in a herding situation, deceptive eWOM can strongly influence changes in consumers’ beliefs and attitudes, whether in the early phase or mainstream phase, at the pre-adoption stage. If deceptive eWOM emerges earlier, it has a more powerful influence later. At the post-adoption stage, once they have used it, consumers may change their evaluations of a new product. However, this new evaluation is still subject to the initial anchoring effect brought by deceptive eWOM. If consumers sense deceptive eWOM and attribute it to a certain responsible party, the anchoring effect will be weakened. These findings provide further knowledge and understanding of the effects of deceptive eWOM, with implications for firms seeking to develop more effective eWOM marketing strategies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",And phrases: deceptive eWOM; fake review; herd behaviour; information cascade; longitudinal study,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,scopus-recommendation,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the long-term effects of deceptive eWOM on consumer beliefs and attitudes, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making in marketing.

Marketing strategy of characteristic agricultural products under the background of ‘internet +’,Xiong Y.,2023,10.1080/09537287.2023.2169649,"At the beginning of 2020, affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, large-scale gathering activities and offline purchasing activities are difficult to operate normally. As a result, the contactless online sales model of farm produce e-business has attracted wide attention of consumers because it avoids direct contact between people and reduces the risk of infection among users. The E-Marketing link of characteristic farm produce can reflect the good advantages of ‘Internet +’ era. For merchants, they can provide better services to customers through the Internet, thus enhancing their purchasing power.

"Electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems, a global and comparative overview of the tax systems designs and rates, legislative framework, Big Tobacco’s marketing strategies, and case studies",Tanca C.; Carrington D.; Dauchy E.; Skipalskyi A.; Bakhturidze G.,2023,10.18332/TPC/172623,"Introduction Electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems (ENDS/ ENNDS) are attracting new nicotine users, particularly nonsmokers, and youth. Although the long-term health effects are uncertain, ENDS contain nicotine—a highly addictive product, and most of the existing evidence on ENDS/ENNDS shows that they are not without risks. Moreover, youth and non-smokers using e-cigarettes are more likely to initiate conventional cigarettes and start at earlier ages. Furthermore, ENDS are not very effective as cessation aids and are often used in combination with conventional tobacco products. The taxation of ENDS/ENNDS remains a challenge for most governments, especially in light is the tradeoff between, on the one hand, the potential that smokers would use ENDS to quit conventional cigarettes successfully and, on the other hand, the new health risks that these products pose and the uptake of use by young people and non-smokers. Objective About ENDS/ENNDS, this session will examine, globally and comparatively, three key areas critical for advocacy: taxation, legal (non-tax and price) frameworks, and communications used by manufacturers and vendors. Material and Methods First, it will present and evaluate the tax systems used currently in countries that manufacture or sell ENDS/ENNDS and compare these systems based on their tax burdens and designs. Second, it examines the various legal (non-tax and price) frameworks used in these countries and compares them with conventional cigarettes. Third, it will present the media used by manufacturers and vendors of ENDS/ENNDS, the messages, and the audience they use to promote them. Finally, the session will present and compare case studies to provide concrete examples. Results There is a significant variation in the types of tax systems used for ENDS/ENNDS, and most countries impose very low tax rates on these products compared to cigarettes. As WHO has concluded, e-cigarettes are “harmful” and countries that have not banned e-cigarettes should ensure that “their tobacco control laws and regulations are comprehensive enough to regulate all forms of novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products.” E-cigarette manufacturers, including the major tobacco companies, are spending millions of dollars on lobbying decision-makers in countries around the world to seek favorable e-cigarette regulation. Further, the industry targets non-smokers and young people through product design, nicotine delivery, flavorings, and by marketing on social media. Conclusions Encourage countries to follow WHO recommendations and impose high taxation for ENDS/ENNDS and regulations that match those of conventional cigarettes. © (2023), (European Publishing).

Applying the triple coherence line to in-store marketing plans to increase private label market share,Garrido-Morgado Á.; González-Benito Ó.,2024,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103642,"Difficult economic times might encourage private label purchases, though most such decisions occur in-store. The current study therefore presents an analysis of whether in-store displays (ISD) exert similar effects on private labels versus national brands, which ISD are most effective, and how retailers can maximize their effects. With a triple coherence line (TCL) framework, the authors determine ISD that favor a decision process in which the consumer can easily recognize the benefits of a promotion, increase their impact on sales, especially if the product itself offers similar benefits. They establish a novel, unique data set of scanner and observational data about daily product prices and sales in 22 categories, according to the uses of different ISD (shelf signage, end-of-aisle, islands) and promotions (price, product). The results confirm their different effects on private labels versus national brands; when ISD facilitate decision processes that are congruent with private-label purchase motivations, they exert greater effects on sales, and these effects can be maximized by applying the TCL framework. In detail, shelf signage that stimulates more cognitive and rational purchase decisions exerts powerful effects on private label purchases, which get reinforced by price promotions. These insights extend previous studies of in-store marketing actions and purchase decisions, leading to some useful recommendations for retailers. © 2023 The Authors",In-store display; National brand; Private label; Triple coherence line,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-recommendation,Tactical,"The study focuses on how in-store displays affect consumer purchasing decisions for private labels versus national brands, providing actionable insights for retailers.

RATIONALIZING FICTION CUES: PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DISCLOSING ADS AND THE INACCURACY OF THE HUMAN MIND WHEN BEING IN PARASOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS,Degen J.L.,2023,10.28945/5108,"Aim/Purpose Parasocial relationships are today established on social media between influenc-ers and their followers. While marketing effects are well-researched, little is known about the meaning of such relationships and the psychological mecha-nisms behind them. This study, therefore, explores the questions: “How do fol-lowers on Instagram interpret explicit fiction cues from influencers?” and “What does this reveal about the meaning of parasocial attachment?” Background With a billion-dollar advertising industry and leading in influencing opinion, In-stagram is a significant societal and economic player. One factor for the effec-tive influence of consumers is the relationship between influencer and follower. Research shows that disclosing advertisements surprisingly does not harm credi-bility, and sometimes even leads to greater trustworthiness and, in turn, willing-ness to purchase. While such reverse dynamics are measurable, the mechanisms behind them remain largely unexplored. Methodology The study follows an explorative approach with in-depth interviews, which are analyzed with Mayring’s content analysis under a reconstructive paradigm. The findings are discussed through the lens of critical psychology. Contribution Firstly, this study contributes to the understanding of the communicative dy-namics of influencer-follower communication alongside the reality-fiction-gap model, and, secondly, it contributes empirical insights through the analysis of 22 explorative interviews. Findings The findings show (a) how followers rationalize fiction cues and justify compul-sive decision-making, (b) how followers are vulnerable to influences, and (c) how parasocial attachment formation overshadows rational logic and agency.Rationalizing Fiction Cues 86 The findings are discussed with regard to mechanisms, vulnerabilities, rationali-zations and cognitive bias, and the social self, as well as the ethics of influencer marketing and politics. Recommendations for Practitioners The paper has relevance for professionals working with children, the youth, and adults, in understanding their relationships and their meaning both on the indi-vidual and societal level. Such improve insights and adequate measures in peda-gogy, education, health, and therapy. Furthermore, critical perspectives on par-asociallity and its mechanisms can contribute to ethical policymaking.
