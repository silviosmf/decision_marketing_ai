"PurposeWith the advancement of digital transformation, it is important for e-retailers to use artificial intelligence (AI) for customer engagement (CE), as CE enables e-retail brands to succeed. Essentially, AI e-marketing (AIeMktg) is the use of AI technological approaches in e-marketing by blending customer data, and Retail 4.0 is the digitisation of the physical shopping experience. Therefore, in the era of Retail 4.0, this study investigates the factors influencing the use of AIeMktg for transforming CE.Design/methodology/approachThe primary data were collected from 305 e-retailer customers, and the analysis was performed using a quantitative methodology.FindingsThe results reveal that AIeMktg has tremendous applications in Retail 4.0 for CE. First, it enables marketers to swiftly and responsibly use data to anticipate and predict customer demands and to provide relevant personalised messages and offers with location-based e-marketing. Second, through a continuous feedback loop, AIeMktg improves offerings by analysing and incorporating insights from a 360-degree view of CE.Originality/valueThe main contribution of this study is to provide theoretical underpinnings of CE, AIeMktg, factors influencing the use of AIeMktg, and customer commitment in the era of Retail 4.0. Subsequently, it builds and validates structural relationships among such theoretical underpinning variables in transforming CE with AIeMktg, which is important for customers to expect a different type of shopping experience across digital channels.","Behera, RK; Bala, PK; Rana, NP; Algharabat, RS; Kumar, K",Strategic,10.1108/MIP-04-2023-0145,Artificial intelligence; Customer engagement; Customer commitment; Retail 4.0; E-Marketing,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of AI e-marketing in transforming customer engagement within the context of Retail 4.0.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial marketing has seen significant research attention through various theoretical lenses with an emerging thread examining the dark side effects of AI. Thirty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with buyers and suppliers of AI marketing solutions to investigate the consequences of AI 'dark forces' on B2B relationships. We posit AI as a new actor that has blurred the lines of the actors-resourcesactivities model. Findings show AI is now considered a new actor within B2B networks wielding dark force consequences such as algorithmic gatekeeping, which initiates dehumanization effects. In addition, AI is reliant on access to datasets which drives up resource costs. A lack of accountability of AI marketing solutions leads to opportunistic behaviours compromising actor relationships. Our conceptual model maps our understanding of the dark force consequences underpinning theoretical and managerial implications and recommendations for increased awareness and mitigation of dark forces.","Keegan, BJ; Iredale, S; Naudé, P",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.10.001,Artificial intelligence; B2B relationships; Dark forces; Tensions; Dehumanization,10.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of AI in industrial marketing, particularly its 'dark forces' and their impact on B2B relationships, which aligns with strategic planning and understanding the broader effects on organizational goals.",wos-ai,60,20,Examining the dark force consequences of AI as a new actor in B2B relationships,2023
"The United Nations identified sustainable development goals that focus on the three pillars of sustainabilityEconomy, Society, and Environment. The capability of Artificial intelligence (AI) for societal good and support to these three pillars is a matter of research importance. Drawing attention to literature on various AI frameworks for climate change and the dynamic capability theory, this study conducts a survey of managers working within their AI ecosystem of B2B firms. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling are used to test the reliability, validity, and fitness of the research model. This model illustrates how big databased AI system can influence business performance due to climate change. Research findings reveals paths involving big data based artificial intelligence system, climate change competency process (prediction competency, mitigation competency, adaptation competency), climate competent decision-making, and firm performance, are statistically significant. As a part of research validation, three business cases are studied that focus on the decision-making capability of business under an uncertain environment. This study justifies that climate competent decision-making is a critical skill for businesses operating under uncertain environmental changes. This research brings out management perceptions generated due to climate change and discusses how they influence managers' behaviors that alter relationship dynamics and structure.","Shankar, R; Gupta, L",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.12.019,Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Dynamic capability theory; Climate change competency process; Decision making; Structural equation modeling,5.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The study focuses on long-term implications of AI on business performance in the context of climate change, aligning with strategic planning and decision-making at the organizational level.",wos-ai,60,20,An integrated AI framework for managing organizational risk and climate change concerns in B2B market,2024
"This quantitative research study explores the impact of live marketing on consumers' irrational consumption behavior within the context of the new economic era. Adopting a structured approach, data were collected from 236 consumers through structured questionnaires utilizing Likert scale responses. Simple random sampling ensured a statistically representative sample across diverse demographics. The questionnaires comprehensively addressed various dimensions including exposure to live marketing events, emotional engagement, social media influencer impact, cognitive dissonance, socioeconomic factors, innovative marketing technologies, and irrational consumption behaviors. The data analysis was conducted meticulously utilizing SPSS and SmartPLS, involving various statistical techniques like summary statistics, correlation study, validation of factor analysis, and structural equation modeling, as well as comparative, moderation, and mediation analyses. The study uncovers novel insights, particularly highlighting the role of social media influencers in live marketing, elucidating how their involvement significantly amplifies the impact of social influence on consumers' irrational consumption decisions. Furthermore, findings reveal that consumers perceiving live marketing as immersive and memorable are more inclined towards engaging in irrational consumption behaviors. Additionally, the adoption of innovative live marketing technologies emerges as a key driver of brand perception, consequently leading to heightened levels of irrational consumption behaviors. Moreover, cognitive dissonance following such behaviors is identified as a significant factor contributing to increased repeat purchases. This research contributes to a more profound comprehension of consumer behavior within marketing contexts, providing valuable insights for marketers navigating the complexities of the contemporary economic landscape.","Li, MC; Deng, RC; Gong, B",Strategic,10.1007/s13132-024-02146-x,Live marketing events; Consumers' irrational consumption behavior; Socioeconomic factors; New economic era; Emotional engagement,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The study investigates the long-term impacts of live marketing on consumer behavior, providing insights that can shape overarching marketing strategies and brand perception in a new economic context.",wos-ai,60,25,Research on the Impact of Live Marketing on Consumers' Irrational Consumption Behavior Under the Background of the New Economic Era,2024
"Sustainability is at the top of the agenda of most tech companies. Specifically, tech companies increasingly utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to meet their sustainability goals. However, little is known about how tech companies can leverage AI to accelerate sustainability by formulating and implementing appropriate strategies. To better understand the intertwined nature of AI and sustainability from a strategy perspective, this research conceptually develops a novel AI x Sustainability framework by drawing from the nested sustainability model and integrating insights from different literature streams. It then applies this framework to six leading Big Tech companies (i.e., Amazon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, and SAP) by conducting a comprehensive document analysis of 69 documents describing 244 individual AI x Sustainability initiatives to reveal whether and how these companies appear to follow specific AI x Sustainability strategies. Lastly, an exploratory survey with potential tech companies' clients ( N = 192) sheds light on how clients perceive tech companies' communicated strategic positioning based on the framework. The research provides new theoretical insights, serves as a blueprint for other tech companies, including implications for their AI x Sustainability positioning, and offers a variety of future research directions.","Zechiel, F; Blaurock, M; Weber, E; Büttgen, M; Coussement, K",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.03.010,AI; Sustainability; Strategy; Strategic management; Twin transition; Tech companies,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract focuses on formulating and implementing strategies for leveraging AI to achieve sustainability goals within tech companies, indicating a long-term planning perspective.",wos-ai,70,15,How tech companies advance sustainability through artificial intelligence: Developing and evaluating an AI x Sustainability strategy framework,2024
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a pervasive technology and companies are increasingly urged to adopt and implement it in order to thrive and innovate. While much has been researched on the role AI can play in business-to customer (B2C) settings, a research gap exists when it comes to business-to-business (B2B), which is characterized by higher complexity, increasing number of players, and larger volumes of data. In such a context, an emerging issue deals with the possibility of understanding how companies can leverage AI to aptly manage the customer journey. This aspect touches on many organizational activities, so managers must be aware of existing solutions, process implications, and potential outcomes. In this article, we present an empirical study of 61 Indian B2B companies and provide an input-process-output (IPO) framework to help managers understand and profit from AI solutions while effectively managing the customer journey. We add value to literature on using AI to improve the customer journey in B2B settings. The developed IPO model can be used as a roadmap for introducing AI in managing customer journeys as well as a strategic instrument for organizational change and design.","Khvatova, T; Appio, FP; Ray, S; Schiavone, F",Strategic,10.1109/TEM.2023.3284532,Artificial intelligence (AI); business-to-business (B2B); customer journey; input-process-output (IPO) model; multiple cases,5.0,,5,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of AI adoption in B2B settings and provides a framework for managers to understand and leverage AI in managing the customer journey, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-ai,70,20,Exploring the Role of AI in B2B Customer Journey Management: Towards an IPO Model,2023
"Once artificial intelligence (AI) is indistinguishable from human intelligence, and robots are highly similar in appearance and behavior to humans, there should be no reason to treat AI and robots differently from humans. However, even perfect AI and robots may still be subject to a bias (referred to as speciesism in this article), which will disadvantage them and be a barrier to their commercial adoption as chatbots, decision and recommendation systems, and staff in retail and service settings. The author calls for future research that determines causes and psychological consequences of speciesism, assesses the effect of speciesism on the adoption of new products and technologies, and identifies ways to overcome it.","Schmitt, B",Strategic,10.1007/s11002-019-09499-3,,10.0,,5,15,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses long-term considerations regarding the treatment of AI and robots in society, including the need for future research on speciesism and its implications for technology adoption.

"Literature on brand deletion (BD), a critical and topical decision within a firm's marketing strategy, is extremely scarce. The present research is concerned with the decision making process and examines the effect on BD success of three different approaches to decision making - rational, intuitive and political - and of the interaction between the rational and political approaches. The moderating effect of the type of BD - i.e., total brand killing or disposal vs. brand name change - is also analyzed. The model is tested on a sample of 155 cases of BD. Results point to positive effects on BD success of both rationality and intuition, and a negative effect of politics. Findings also indicate that the negative impact of political behavior on BD success is minimized in the absence of evidence and objective information and when the BD is undertaken through a brand name change.

"Firms are faced with uncertain sales responses even though they advertise appropriately. To help marketing managers make optimal budget decisions in this situation, we develop a stochastic model, depicting the problem of advertising budget decision as a special Markov decision process where a new objective, maximizing expected market utility, is proposed. In the model we introduce a two-dimension state variable including accumulative sales, which vary randomly with advertising budget, and the predicted probability that an advertising campaign obtains a full sales response. We make an analysis of the model on the premise of growing infinite market potential, deriving the property of optimal policies and that of optimal value function. These results are successfully used to make advertising budget decisions for a private university in Xi'an, China. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"There is little research on how consumers decide whether they want to use algorithmic advice or not. In this research, we show that consumers' lay beliefs about artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a heuristic cue to evaluate accuracy of algorithmic advice in different professional service domains. Three studies provide robust evidence that consumers who believe that AI is higher than human intelligence are more likely to adopt algorithmic advice. We also demonstrate that lay beliefs about AI only influence adoption of algorithmic advice when a decision task is perceived to be complex.","von Walter, B; Kremmel, D; Jäger, B",Operational,10.1007/s11002-021-09589-1,Algorithmic advice; Robo-advisors; Complexity; Artificial intelligence; Service automation; Professional services,5.0,,60,5,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses how consumers make decisions regarding the use of algorithmic advice, which relates to day-to-day consumer behavior and decision-making processes influenced by AI.

"Artificial Intelligence is poised to transform all facets of marketing. In this study, we examine the link between firms' focus on AI in their 10-K reports and their gross and net operating efficiency. 10-K reports are a salient source of insight into an array of issues in accounting and finance research, yet remain relatively overlooked in marketing. Drawing upon economic and marketing theory, we develop a guiding framework to show how firms' AI focus could be related to gross and net operating efficiency. We then use a system of simultaneous equations to empirically test the relationship between AI focus and operating efficiency. Our findings confirm that US-listed firms are in a state of impending transformation with regards to AI. We show how AI focus is associated with improvements in net profitability, net operating efficiency and return on marketing-related investment while reducing adspend and creating jobs.","Mishra, S; Ewing, MT; Cooper, HB",Strategic,10.1007/s11747-022-00876-5,Firm performance; Firm efficiency; Artificial intelligence; Marketing metrics,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of AI focus in firms, particularly how it relates to operating efficiency and profitability, which aligns with strategic planning in marketing.",wos-ai,60,25,Artificial intelligence focus and firm performance,2022
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proved its significance in every field and is yet to be explored in the banking sector in India. The study aims to understand the customers' perception of using AI-based technologies in banks. Satisfaction is the first step towards acceptability and retention of customers towards lesser-known technology and automated process implemented in banks. The constructs of the study are referred from the technology acceptance model to define their level of acceptance and are divided into independent and dependent variables. The independent variables are transparency, awareness level, security, efficiency, trust, and social influence, and the dependent variable is customer satisfaction. Therefore, the structural equation model was developed from the customers' (N = 500) response to retail banks in northern India. The study reveals that trust is the most significant factor for greater customers' satisfaction towards AI-enabled technologies in banks, followed by the customers' awareness level. The security of AI-based banks is the least important contributor to customer satisfaction. Additionally, the control variables, i.e., age and gender, govern the customers' perception. Understanding customer acceptability towards AI-based technology in retail banks is rare in emerging nations such as India. The findings provide insight into the formulation of compliance. It also highlights the regulation applicable to digital banks by the competent authority in India. The paper concludes by stating practical implications for banking authorities and decision-makers to incorporate AI into their system for customer service.","Bharti, SS; Prasad, K; Sudha, S; Kumari, V",Strategic,10.1057/s41264-023-00241-9,Customer acceptance; Banking industry; Artificial Intelligence; Technology acceptance model; Structural equation modelling; Partial least square,5.0,,10,5,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,"The abstract focuses on understanding customer perception and satisfaction regarding AI technologies in banks, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning in the banking sector.",wos-ai,60,20,Customer acceptability towards AI-enabled digital banking: a PLS-SEM approach,2023
"Purpose The recent advancements in smartphone technology and social media platforms have increased the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) color cosmetics. Meanwhile, China is a lucrative market for various foreign beauty products and technological innovations. This research aims to investigate the adoption of AI color cosmetics applications and their electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) intention among Chinese social media influencers. Several key concepts have been proposed in this research, namely body esteem, price sensitivity, social media addiction and actual purchase. Design/methodology/approach An online questionnaire design was used in this research. A combination of purposive sampling and snowball sampling of AI color cosmetics users who are also social media influencers in China yields 221 respondents. To analyze the data, this research employs Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) method via SPSS and AMOS software. A 2-step approach, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), is implemented to prove the hypotheses and generate the results. Findings 1) Social media addiction is a positive predictor of AI color cosmetics usage, (2) AI color cosmetics usage is a positive predictor of actual purchase, (3) actual purchase is a positive predictor of e-WOM intention and lastly, (4) there is a full mediation effect of actual purchase.

"The research note discusses the potential effects of contemporary technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), in enhancing consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews in the tourism and hospitality context. The study postulates that three characteristics of blockchain - decentralization, immutability, and timestamping - ensure transparency in the online review process. Using a socio-technical systems approach, the current study provides insights into how blockchain technology, AI agents, and human factors interact to facilitate such transparency and thereby enhance consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews for their decision-making. Therefore, the study proposes that perceived transparency mediates the relationship between these three blockchain characteristics and the trustworthiness of online reviews.

"This study investigated the impact of anthropomorphism on customers' decisions to use artificial intelligence (AI) devices in hotels, along with other traditional predictors. The study's model considered the co-occurrence of positive and negative effects of anthropomorphism, including social presence and identity threats, which compete to control evaluative attitudes toward AI devices. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the model using data from 363 participants. The results showed that anthropomorphism positively enhances social presence, leading to higher performance expectancy and positive emotions toward AI devices. Anthropomorphism also entails identity threats, resulting in increased effort expectancy and negative emotions. These trade-offs highlight the need for hotels to consider how customers perceive and respond to anthropomorphized AI devices during service delivery and to choose the level of anthropomorphism accordingly. This study highlights the benefits and cost trade-offs inherent in anthropomorphism and explains how they affect the evaluative attitudinal responses toward AI devices.","Alsaad, A",Tactical,10.1080/19368623.2023.2223584,technology acceptance; artificial intelligence; anthropomorphism; social presence; identity threat,5.0,,10,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The study provides insights into the use of anthropomorphism in AI devices within hotels, which can inform specific marketing strategies and customer engagement tactics.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an important foundation of competitive advantage in the market for firms. As such, firms use AI to achieve deep market engagement when the firm's data are employed to make informed decisions. This study examines the role of computer-mediated AI agents in detecting crises related to events in a firm. A crisis threatens organizational performance; therefore, a data-driven strategy will result in an efficient and timely reflection, which increases the success of crisis management. The study extends the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) and Attribution theory frameworks built on big data and machine learning capabilities for early detection of crises in the market. This research proposes a structural model composed of a statistical and sentimental big data analytics approach. The findings of our empirical research suggest that knowledge extracted from day-to-day data communications such as email communications of a firm can lead to the sensing of critical events related to business activities. To test our model, we use a publicly available dataset containing 517,401 items belonging to 150 users, mostly senior managers of Enron during 1999 through the 2001 crisis.

"The precision of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated information has been suggested in the past as a method of nudging consumers' evaluations and intentions, but little is known about whether such effects are also context-sensitive. Based on four studies, we find a matched condition under which consumers are more likely to make a positive response when precise (imprecise) numbers presented by AI recommenders are used in a utilitarian (hedonic) consumption context (Study 1). Additionally, we show that consumer conceptual fluency also mediates this matching effect on consumer purchase decision-making (Studies 2). We further show the matching effect is moderated by the recommender type (Study 3) and consumer lay beliefs about the AI and human recommenders (Study 4). This study shows that when consumers' lay belief changes from AI performs objective tasks well and Human performs subjective tasks well to AI performs subjective tasks well and Human performs objective tasks well, it can change the difference in the matching relationship between human and AI recommenders.","Zhu, H; Zhu, ZM; Ou, YL; Yin, Y",Operational,10.1002/mar.21904,AI adoption; artificial intelligence; conceptual fluency; hedonic product; preciseness; recommendation; utilitarian product,5.0,,65,5,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the impact of AI-generated information on consumer decision-making, particularly in the context of recommendations and consumer preferences, which aligns with day-to-day operational decisions.",wos-ai,10,15,To be precise (imprecise) in utilitarian (hedonic) contexts: Examining the influence of numerical precision on consumer reactions to artificial intelligence-based recommendations,2023
"Many B2B firms have widely accepted AI-based chatbots to provide human-like service interaction at different customer touchpoints in recent years. One of the objectives behind introducing this technology is to provide an enhanced, live channel Customer Experience (CX) all round the clock. Researchers have focused on delivering the CX by improvising the chatbot's internal algorithm, giving limited attention to CX theories from management literature, which leaves a gap. With the proposed paper, we have investigated the influencing factors of AI-based chatbots from the lens of CX theories for B2B firms. In this paper, a model for organizing CX has been proposed using the diffusion of innovation theory, trust commitment theory, information systems success model, and Hoffman & Novak's flow model for the computer-mediated environment and verified using the social media data. The methodology used for this study is the social media analytics-based content analysis method (sentiment analysis, hierarchical clustering, topic modeling) for data preparation, followed by lasso and ridge regression for model verification. The results suggest that CX in B2B enterprises using chatbots is influenced by these bots' overall system design, customers' ability to use technology, and customer trust towards brand and system.","Kushwaha, AK; Kumar, P; Kar, AK",Tactical,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.08.011,Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; Big data analytics; Customer experience; Social media analytics; Service quality,5.0,,25,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the implementation of AI-based chatbots in B2B firms focusing on enhancing customer experience (CX) through specific methodologies and metrics, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",wos-ai,10,60,What impacts customer experience for B2B enterprises on using AI-enabled chatbots?

In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.","Yun, JH; Lee, EJ; Kim, DH",Out of scope,10.1002/mar.21445,apathy; artificial intelligence; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; medical decision-making; personalization; prosociality,,0.0,0,100,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the acceptance of AI in medical care, which falls outside the marketing context, particularly focusing on healthcare, making it irrelevant to the given classifications.",wos-ai,0,0,Behavioral and neural evidence on consumer responses to human doctors and medical artificial intelligence,2021
"Voice shopping creates a novel shopping experience as it is prompted by human-AI interaction. It greatly reduces the time required in consumer decision-making, while it could impair consumers' autonomy. This study thus investigates how the social role of voice assistants and user autonomy affect consumers' relationships and buying decisions. Using media equation theory, two experimental studies examined the effects of social role and user autonomy on perceived human-likeness, trust, and purchase intention. Study 1 (86 participants) and Study 2 (112 participants) found that perceived human-likeness and trust serially mediated the relationship between user autonomy and purchase intention. This finding contributes to the media equation research by affirming the effectiveness of implicit anthropomorphism processing and highlights the importance of improving consumers' confidence via voice channels.","Huh, J; Whang, C; Kim, HY",Operational,10.1080/20932685.2022.2085603,Human-AI interaction; voice assistant; voice shopping; social role; user autonomy,10.0,,60,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,"The abstract discusses the effects of voice shopping on consumer decision-making facilitated by AI assistants, indicating a focus on day-to-day activities and interactions between consumers and technology.",wos-ai,10,20,Building trust with voice assistants for apparel shopping: The effects of social role and user autonomy,2023
"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and human employees have emerged as the dominant forms of online customer service. However, existing research rarely connects the service differences between them in terms of product type, ignoring the interactivity between the two. This study reveals the effect of matching customer service type (AI chatbot vs. human) to product type (search vs. experience) on consumers' purchase intentions through four experiments, revealing the psychological mechanism and boundary condition for the existence of this effect. It shows that (1) the match between customer service type and product type positively affects consumers' purchase intentions; (2) this matching effect is mediated by processing fluency and perceived service quality; and (3) the matching effect works only when consumers' demand certainty is low. These findings enrich the theoretical study of online customer service, and provide marketing insights for companies to improve the adoption of AI chatbots and human employees.","Chen, SL; Li, XL; Liu, KC; Wang, XS",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21862,artificial intelligence; chatbot; demand certainty; human employee; online customer service; processing fluency; product type,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The study focuses on the interaction between AI chatbots and human employees in online customer service and their impact on consumer purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing strategies and customer engagement.",wos-ai,10,70,Chatbot or human?

"Firms are increasingly turning towards new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and drones, among others, to assist in interacting with their customers. Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.

"Based on a sample of 77 highly innovative products, this study examines the usage and the relative importance of a set of go/no-go decision criteria at four major gates of the new product development (NPD) process. The findings reveal that go/no-go criteria can be grouped into five dimensions: strategic fit, technical feasibility, customer acceptance, market opportunity, and financial performance. Strategic fit dimension is mainly applied in approving the new product concept. Technical feasibility dimension is crucial in approving the new product concept and the product prototype. The usage of customer acceptance dimension is notably high throughout the entire development process, particularly after product launch. Market opportunity dimension is mostly employed to approve the new product concept and the maintenance of the product on the market. Financial performance dimension stands out near the end of the development process. 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Rapid development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applications challenge managers and policy makers to harness these transformative technologies. In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel word-of-machine effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1-4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person's unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human-AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a-b).","Longoni, C; Cian, L",Operational,10.1177/0022242920957347,algorithms; artificial intelligence; augmented intelligence; hedonic and utilitarian consumption; recommendations; technology,5.0,,60,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses AI recommendations and consumer preferences, which are directly related to managing day-to-day activities in marketing and decision-making processes.

"Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI-human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees' creativity in answering customers' questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees' interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills.","Jia, N; Luo, XM; Fang, Z; Liao, CC",Tactical,10.5465/amj.2022.0426,,5.0,,15,0,ACAD MANAGEMENT,"The abstract discusses AI assistance in enhancing employee creativity and performance in a specific context (telemarketing), which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving structured targets and optimizing processes.",wos-ai,10,70,WHEN AND HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUGMENTS EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY,2024
"PurposeMachine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly important in enabling business-to-business (B2B) companies to offer personalized services to business customers. On the other hand, humans play a critical role in dealing with uncertain situations and the relationship-building aspects of a B2B business. Most existing studies advocating human-ML augmentation simply posit the concept without providing a detailed view of augmentation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how human involvement can practically augment ML capabilities to develop a personalized information system (PIS) for business customers.Design/methodology/approachThe authors developed a research framework to create an integrated human-ML PIS for business customers. The PIS was then implemented in the energy sector. Next, the accuracy of the PIS was evaluated using customer feedback. To this end, precision, recall and F1 evaluation metrics were used.FindingsThe computed figures of precision, recall and F1 (respectively, 0.73, 0.72 and 0.72) were all above 0.5; thus, the accuracy of the model was confirmed. Finally, the study presents the research model that illustrates how human involvement can augment ML capabilities in different stages of creating the PIS including the business/market understanding, data understanding, data collection and preparation, model creation and deployment and model evaluation phases.Originality/valueThis paper offers novel insight into the less-known phenomenon of human-ML augmentation for marketing purposes.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, yet little is known about how consumers experience medical AI and make decisions about using these providers for follow-up care. We take an interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioral and neuroimaging experiments to determine how anthropomorphism and personalization influence consumers' well-being and their decisions about a provider for follow-up care. Study 1 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, consumers are likely to experience a heightened sense of well-being after a highly personalized medical consultation. However, regardless of whether the first interaction is highly personalized or not, they prefer follow-up visits with a human doctor, as mediated through empathy. Study 2 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, the anterior cingulate cortex shows greater activation in a highly (vs. low) personalized interaction, the activation of which is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit that provider. Furthermore, the temporal occipital fusiform cortex shows greater activation in consultations with a human doctor (vs. medical AI), regardless of the interaction's level of personalization. The level of activation is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit with the initial provider. The findings suggest that medical AI cannot currently replace human doctors and that human doctors remain consumers' choice for medical consultations and treatment.","Zhang, YR; Tan, WY; Lee, EJ",Out of scope,10.1002/mar.21911,anthropomorphism; artificial intelligence; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; healthcare,,0.0,0,100,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the experience of consumers with medical AI in healthcare, which falls outside the realm of marketing applications.",wos-ai,0,0,Consumers' responses to personalized service from medical artificial intelligence and human doctors,2024
"Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether order and scale of market entry influence a new product's market and financial performance, and how marketing and R&D resources strengthen or weaken these effects. Design/methodology/approach - Through a mail survey, data were collected on a sample of 136 product launches by Spanish manufacturing firms. A moderated hierarchical regression analysis enabled the assessment of the relevance of order and scale as well as their interactions with marketing and R&D resources to explain a product's competitive position. Moreover, a mediation analysis allowed us to determine whether market entry strategy (indirectly) affects financial performance. Findings - The analyses show that pioneering firms and those entering the market with a full-scale launch achieve advantages in terms of competitive position, and that this variable mediates the relationship of order and scale with profitability. The empirical results also reveal that such advantages are conditioned by the availability of marketing and R&D resources. Practical implications - The decisions regarding order and scale of market entry are contingent. Managers involved in the planning of a new product launch should be knowledgeable about their firm's resources and capabilities before determining when and how to enter the market. Originality/value - Many papers study the effects of order-of-entry on market share, but other dimensions of a new product launch strategy, such as scale, have largely been ignored. The research examines the effects of both variables on competitive position and profitability. This is also one of the first studies that explores the moderating effect exerted by resources and capabilities in the launch strategy-performance relationship.","Rodríguez-Pinto, J; Gutiérrez-Cillán, J; Rodríguez-Escudero, AI",Strategic,10.1108/03090560710737633,market entry; new products; competitive strategy; profit; Spain,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,"The paper discusses the long-term implications of market entry strategies on competitive position and financial performance, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making at the organizational level.",wos-ai,60,25,"Order and scale of market entry, firm resources, and performance",2007

"We study the problem a diagnostic expert (e.g., a physician) faces when offering a diagnosis to a client (e.g., a patient) that may be based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability or supplemented by a diagnostic test-conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) tools alike-revealing the client's true condition. The expert's diagnostic ability (or type) is private information. The expert is impurely altruistic in that the expert cares about both the client's utility and the expert's own reputational payoff that depends on the peer perception of the expert's diagnostic ability. The decision of whether to perform the test, which is costly for the client, provides the expert with an opportunity to influence that perception. We show a unique separating equilibrium exists in which the high-type expert does not resort to diagnostic testing and offers a diagnosis based only on the expert's own diagnostic ability, whereas the low-type expert performs the test. Furthermore, we establish that high-type expert may skip necessary diagnostic tests to separate them from the low-type expert. Interestingly, the effect of reputational payoff on undertesting is nonmonotonic, and the desire to appear of high type leads to undertesting only when the reputational payoff is intermediate. Our results also suggest a more altruistic expert may be more likely to engage in undertesting. Furthermore, efforts to encourage testing by providing financial incentives or by raising malpractice lawsuit concerns may, surprisingly, help fuel undertesting in the equilibrium. Our paper sheds new light on barriers to the adoption of AI tools aimed at enhancing physicians' diagnostic decision making.","Dai, TL; Singh, S",Out of scope,10.1287/mksc.2019.1201,game theory; health; undertesting; diagnostic expert; information asymmetry; artificial intelligence,,0.0,0,100,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a diagnostic expert's decision-making process in healthcare and the implications of reputational concerns and testing on diagnostics, which is not related to marketing.",wos-ai,0,0,Conspicuous by Its Absence: Diagnostic Expert Testing Under Uncertainty,2020
"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to comprehend how AI aids marketers in engaging customers and generating value for the company by way of customer engagement (CE). CE is a popular area of research for scholars and practitioners. One area of research that could have far-reaching ramifications with regard to strengthening CE is artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, it becomes extremely important to understand how AI is helping the marketer reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. Design/methodology/approachA detailed approach using both systematic review and bibliometric analysis was used. It involved identifying key research areas, the most influential authors, studies, journals, countries and organisations. Then, a comprehensive analysis of 50 papers was carried out in the four identified clusters through co-citation analysis. Furthermore, a content analysis of 42 articles for the past six years was also conducted. FindingsEmerging themes explored through cluster analysis are CE concepts and value creation, social media strategies, big data innovation and significance of AI in tertiary industry. Identified themes for content analysis are CE conceptualisation, CE behaviour in social media, CE role in value co-creation and CE via AI. Research limitations/implicationsCE has emerged as a topic of great interest for marketers in recent years. With the rapid growth of digital media and the spread of social media, firms are now embarking on new online strategies to promote CE (Javornik and Mandelli, 2012). In this review, the authors have thoroughly assessed multiple facets of prior research papers focused on the utilisation of AI in the context of CE. The existing research papers highlighted that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants offer real-time interaction capabilities, swiftly addressing inquiries, delivering assistance and navigating customers through their experiences (Cheng and Jiang, 2022; Naqvi et al., 2023). This rapid and responsive engagement serves to enrich the customer's overall interaction with the business. Consequently, this research can contribute to a comprehensive knowledge of how AI is assisting marketers to reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. This study also sheds light on both the attitudinal and behavioural aspects of CE on social media. While existing CE literature highlights the motivating factors driving engagement, the study underscores the significance of behavioural engagement in enhancing firm performance. It emphasises the need for researchers to understand the intricate dynamics of engagement in the context of hedonic products compared to utilitarian ones (Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut, 2020). CEs on social media assist firms in using their customers as advocates and value co-creators (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Sawhney et al., 2005). A few of the CE themes are conceptual in nature; hence, there is an opportunity for scholarly research in CE to examine the ways in which AI-driven platforms can effectively gather customer insights. As per the prior relationship marketing studies, it is evident that building relationships reduces customer uncertainty (Barari et al., 2020). Therefore, by using data analysis, businesses can extract valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviour, equipping them to engage with customers more effectively. Practical implicationsThe rapid growth of social media has enabled individuals to articulate their thoughts, opinions and emotions related to a brand, which creates a large amount of data for VCC. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a radical way of providing value content to users. It expands on a broader concept of how software and algorithms work like human beings. Data collected from customer interactions are a major prerequisite for efficiently using AI for enhancing CE. AI not only reduces error rates but, at the same time, helps human beings in decision-making during complex situations. Owing to built-in algorithms that analyse large amounts of data, companies can inspect areas that require improvement in real time. Time and resources can also be saved by automating tasks contingent on customer responses and insights. AI enables the analysis of customer data to create highly personalised experiences. It can also forecast customer behaviour and trends, helping businesses anticipate needs and preferences. This enables proactive CE strategies, such as targeted offers or timely outreach. Furthermore, AI tools can analyse customer feedback and sentiment across various channels. This feedback can be used to make necessary improvements and address concerns promptly, ultimately fostering stronger customer relationships. AI can facilitate seamless engagement across multiple digital channels, ensuring that customers can interact with a brand through their preferred means, be it social media, email, or chat. Consequently, this research proposes that practitioners and companies can use analysis performed by AI-enabled systems on CEB, which can assist companies in exploring the extent to which each product influences CE. Understanding the importance of these attributes would assist companies in developing more memorable CE features. Originality/valueThis study examines how prominent CE and AI are in academic research on social media by identifying research gaps and future developments.

"Technology and media are delivering content that is transforming society. Providers must compete for consumer attention to sell their digital information goods effectively. This is challenging, since there is a high level of uncertainty associated with the consumption of such goods. Service providers often use free programming to share product information. We examine the effectiveness of content sampling strategy used for on-demand series dramas, a unique class of entertainment goods. The data were extracted from a large set of household video-on-demand (VoD) viewing records and combined with external data sources. We extended a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to handle censored data, which permitted us to explore the main causal relationships. Relevant theories in the marketing and information systems disciplines informed our research on consumer involvement and informedness for decision making under uncertainty, the consumption of information goods, and seller strategies for digital content. The results show that content sampling stimulates higher demand for series dramas, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Samples of the series reveal quality information to consumers and allow them to assess preference fit directly. As a result, they become more informed about their purchase decisions. Also, households seem to be willing to pay more to be better informed, and informed households tend to purchase more. This suggests that content providers should invest in strategies that help consumers to understand the preference fit of information goods.","Hoang, AP; Kauffman, RJ",Tactical,10.1080/07421222.2018.1451958,content sampling; data censoring; digital entertainment; household informedness; information asymmetry; information goods; online content; preference fit; propensity score matching; video-on-demand,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the effectiveness of content sampling strategies for on-demand series dramas, which involves structured decision-making regarding marketing tactics to enhance consumer engagement and purchasing behavior.

We synthesize the extant literature into four dimensions for wine tourism value creation, namely, product-related aspects; sensory and affective experiential aspects; cognitive, educational experiential aspects; and social-relational experiential value-creating aspects. So far, most studies merely discuss product-related aspects whilst insights on experiential value are less known. Using online review data from wine tourists in Australia, we develop a novel deep neural network-based framework using an innovative AI-based exploratory design. Results of the case study reveal that in addition to product-related aspects, sensory-and education-related experiential aspects are also highly important for value creation in wine tourism. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as ideas for future research are discussed.","Gao, D; Xia, HY; Deng, WL; Muskat, B; Li, G; Law, R",Tactical,10.1177/13567667221140605,Wine tourism; deep neural network; online review data; value creation; tourist decision-making; exploratory design,5.0,,20,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"The paper explores specific aspects of experiential value in wine tourism and develops a novel framework based on data analysis.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to uncover morality and dynamics of community of incentivized reviewers who primarily review products on Amazon.com. and, as of late, on various social media platforms. This study is important because it uncovers unknown dynamics that shapes consumer morality and drives reviewer's ethics. Given the fact that consumers heavily rely on reviews, findings of this paper are of great values to practitioners, consumers and policymakers and highlight potential area of research particularly related to morality. Design/methodology/approach This study, conducted over a period of 1.5 years, relying on a netnography to collect data and thematic analysis to make sense of data, uncovered behaviors that contribute to the J-shape distribution of reviews on Amazon.com and questionable reviewer ethics. Findings Findings of this study suggest suppressed consumer morality driven by desire to gain benefits in form of free products and manipulation of the review system in an attempt to boost sales and the prevalence of biased reviews. The findings shed light on overconsumption driven by an opportunity to receive free products, introduction of review bias into the public domain and attempts to manipulate Amazon's algorithms. Research limitations/implications Findings of this study carry tremendous implications for average consumer who relies on consumer-generated reviews without realizing the presence of bias. Furthermore, the findings shed light of unfair business practices of sellers who demand high ratings. Finally, the findings suggest that there is opportunity for policymakers to address a loophole because incentivized reviewers, regardless of Federal Trade Commission regulations, may be operating in gray area, much less controlled than advertising. Originality/value This study is unique because while other studies may conduct similar netnographies of reviewing communities, this community was examined during a span that covered the incentivized reviewing boom, Amazon's ban on incentivized reviewing, and the revival of reviewing activity post ban. Given recent changes to Amazon's Terms of Service, the researcher documented changes that future studies will not be able to examine unless data have already been collected. However, post ban activity continues and is likely affecting purchasing decisions of unsuspecting consumers all around.","Rynarzewska, AI",Strategic,10.1108/JCM-02-2018-2570,Consumer behaviour; Decision-making; Trust; Consumer-generated reviews; Incetivized reviews,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study uncovers dynamics that influence consumer morality and reviewer ethics, which are crucial for long-term implications on marketing practices, consumer trust, and regulatory considerations.",wos-ai,60,20,"It's not fake, it's biased: insights into morality of incentivized reviewers",2019

"Although brand deletion (BD) is a key strategic decision within brand portfolio management, it has received very little attention in the scientific literature. This research expands the knowledge base on the BD strategy, particularly in the execution phase. Based on the literature addressing strategic change and marketing strategy implementation, this study explores the main and interaction effects of context (decentralization and consensus) and process (formalization and communication) implementation factors on the success of BD, measured in terms of its contribution to the firm's economic performance. Using a representative sample of 155 cases of BD, we show that the four factors are related to BD performance, although these relations are complex and intertwined. Consensus, communication, and decentralization positively affect BD performance, with consensus being particularly influential. Formalization is found to be a double-edged sword as the effects of formalizing the execution of the deletion are particularly convoluted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"The interplay between longevity risk and health state transitions for retirees' optimal annuitization decisions is investigated. Using a life-cycle framework incorporating wealth levels, bequest motives, and consumption floors created by government subsidies, we examine how increased longevity in conjunction with an individual's health state transition process impacts annuity purchase decisions. Health state transition matrices are estimated from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) data. The effects of increased longevity on annuitization decisions are considered when longevity is both accompanied by increased time spent in healthier states (morbidity compression) or experienced by more time in unhealthy states (morbidity expansion). We find that retirees' annuity demand is affected by wealth, initial health status, and expansion or compression of morbidity. Wealthier retirees have higher annuity demand when health shocks are considered, and increased longevity increases demand even more when retirees expect an expansion or slight morbidity compression. With health shocks and expectations of severe morbidity compression considered, the opposite effect might occur. Thus, an annuity can help retirees hedge health shock costs when slight compression or expansion of morbidity occurs. For retirees with lower wealth, the consumption floor provided by governmental subsidies will create a decreased propensity to annuitize.","Ai, J; Brockett, PL; Golden, LL; Zhu, W",Out of scope,10.1111/jori.12168,,0.0,,0,100,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the financial implications of longevity risk and health transitions for retirees, which falls under financial services rather than marketing.",wos-ai,0,0,Health State Transitions and Longevity Effects on Retirees' Optimal Annuitization,2017

"Purpose The first research objective is to understand the role of digital [artificial intelligence (AI)] technologies on user engagement and conversion that has resulted in high online activities and increased online sales in current times in India. In addition, combined with changes such as social distancing and lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital disruption has largely impacted the old ways of communication both at the individual and organizational levels, ultimately resulting in prominent social change. While interacting in the virtual world, this change is more noticeable. Therefore, the second research objective is to examine if a satisfying experience during online shopping leads to repurchase intention. Design/methodology/approach Using primary data collected from consumers in a developing economy (India), we tested the theoretical model to further extend the theoretical debate in consumer research. Findings This study empirically tests and further establishes that deploying AI technologies have a positive relationship with user engagement and conversion. Further, conversion leads to satisfying user experience. Finally, the relationship between satisfying user experience and repurchase intention is also found to be significant.

"Understanding sectoral dynamic dependence across equity indexes is crucial for investment decisions and designing economic policy. This study examines the sectoral dependence among 82 Pakistani companies using a vine copula approach and daily data from July 1, 2014, to December 17, 2019. Vine copulas represent a flexible dependence approach capable of capturing the dynamic and complex relationships among equity sectors stemming from the nonlinear patterns of asymmetric behavior of returns that cannot be captured by linear dependence models. The results show that the Pakistani stock market is driven by the oil and gas marketing sector and oil and gas exploration sector, with high dependence on commercial banks, fertilizers, power generation and distribution, and automobile parts and accessories. The findings help explain the taildependence structure among equity stocks and sectors in the context of understudied emerging markets such as Pakistan, which is vital for portfolio management and designing sector-level policies.Copyright (c) 2022 Borsa Istanbul Anonim S , irketi .

"This study examines the impacts of online review features on hotel Online Room Sales for various types of hotel segments utilizing a dataset that includes 227,378 post-purchase customer review comments for 1,092 hotels. Data were analyzed by conducting three different analyses utilizing the log-log regression model. Findings suggest that overall recommendation scores and hotel attribute information are the two most critical features of online reviews used by consumers in their decision-making process to make their hotel booking decisions. Thus, changes in customer rating scores result in a profound impact on room sales. However, the impact sizes of these review features are not significantly different among different hotel segments, with one exception, the room rate.

"In today's fiercely competitive business landscape, startups face numerous challenges in achieving scalability and sustainability. The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents promising solutions to these challenges. However, understanding the intricacies of technology acceptance within the startup environment becomes paramount. Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) have long served as foundational frameworks for understanding technology adoption and integration, but their effectiveness is hindered by inherent limitations. These limitations demand further exploration, particularly when viewed through the entrepreneurial lens. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations inherent in TAM and its extensions, alongside other prominent technology acceptance models. By incorporating an entrepreneurial perspective, the analysis reveals additional challenges stemming from the dynamic nature of startup ecosystems. From a pragmatic standpoint, this paper provides actionable insights for technology-driven entrepreneurial organizations to navigate innovation and technology adoption decisions more intelligently. From a theoretical perspective, it contributes to the refinement and evolution of technology acceptance models, particularly in the context of entrepreneurial ventures. In light of these limitations, the paper offers strategic recommendations for future research endeavors. These include encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, contextualizing models to suit startup dynamics, conducting longitudinal studies to capture evolving user perceptions, accounting for individual differences in technology adoption, and validating emerging models to reflect contemporary realities. Emphasis is placed on the entrepreneurial imperative of agility and adaptability in navigating the ever-changing landscape of technology acceptance. Moreover, the paper underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and delineates practical implications for organizations and practitioners aiming to sustain technology acceptance and successful implementation within dynamic startup environments. By addressing these constraints, researchers can pave the way for the development of more robust and comprehensive models, better equipped to clarify and predict technology acceptance and usage patterns. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical need for ongoing refinement and innovation within the realm of technology acceptance, providing actionable insights to propel both scholarly discourse and entrepreneurial practice forward.","Rahimi, RA; Oh, GS",Strategic,10.1057/s41270-024-00318-x,Technology acceptance model; Entrepreneurship; Limitations; Startup environment; Innovation adoption,10.0,,5,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of technology acceptance models (TAMs) in the context of startups, focusing on the need for refinement and innovation to support strategic organizational goals in a dynamic environment.",wos-ai,70,15,Beyond theory: a systematic review of strengths and limitations in technology acceptance models through an entrepreneurial lens,2024
"For many professional services, advice adherence is a necessary condition for achieving service success for both customers and service providers. Despite their pivotal roles in value co-creation, typical conversational interactions often lead to low adherence. We propose that enabling a dominance transition, from provider dominance in the pre-advice stage to customer dominance in the post-advice stage, enhances advice adherence because it increases customers' perceived common ground. Furthermore, providers' consultation focus, customers' prior knowledge, and customers' perceived adherence effort moderate this process. Using mixed methods, including both empirical modeling and controlled and field experiments, we validate the proposed model in various contexts (healthcare, financial services, and fitness and wellness counseling). The findings establish several theoretical contributions and offer managerial implications for improving advice adherence by managing dominance transitions in conversational interactions more effectively through training service providers or even programming AI chatbots.","Wang, HS; Yim, CK",Out of scope,10.1007/s11747-019-00664-8,Advice adherence; Professional service conversations; Conversational dominance; Dominance transitions; Customers' perceived common ground,5.0,,10,70,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses advice adherence in professional services such as healthcare, financial services, and fitness, which are not directly related to marketing.",wos-ai,5,10,Effects of dominance transitions on advice adherence in professional service conversations,2019
"Despite being critical to continuous technology usage, research on remote mobile payments (m-payments) post-adoption usage has received much less attention. Furthermore, information systems usage research has traditionally been positively oriented, generally assuming that the inhibiting and enabling factors influencing technology usage as being the opposite sides of one dimension, which may result in overlooking antecedents to technology continuance. Therefore, this study aims to explore the inhibiting factors that may directly influence customers' intention to discontinue m-payments during post-adoption usage. Drawing on behavioral theories, information systems, and marketing research, this study explores the inhibiting factors directly influencing consumers' intentions to discontinue using m-payments. Survey data were collected from 254 current users in the UK and the PLS-SEM technique is employed to test hypotheses. The results show that poor quality of system, information, and service, as usage inhibitors, directly influence consumers' discontinuance intentions. Importantly, usage frequency is found to have no moderating effect on the inhibitors of continuance intention, supporting the notion about different and asymmetric effects that negative factors can have on technology usage compared to positive ones. This interesting finding suggests that negative user experience will have different and asymmetric effects on intentions to use m-payments than positive user experience.","Koghut, M; AI-Tabbaa, O",Tactical,10.3390/admsci11010018,mobile payment; discontinuance intention; usage inhibitors; information system success model; asymmetric effect,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The study explores specific factors influencing consumers' intentions regarding the discontinuance of mobile payments, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on concrete targets and structured decisions in marketing.",wos-ai,10,70,Exploring Consumers' Discontinuance Intention of Remote Mobile Payments during Post-Adoption Usage: An Empirical Study,2021
"Purpose The decision concerning the degree of product and service customization is crucial, yet has scarcely been studied for small businesses in business-to-business (B2B) contexts. Although such a decision allows relationships with potential customers to be strengthened, it might involve high opportunity costs given the investment required. This paper aims to analyse the profitability of customization undertaken by small businesses in terms of cost-benefit and examine the drivers of profitable customized projects vis-a-vis the ability to strengthen relationships with clients (relationship investment and customer involvement) and the firm's resources related to processes and technology (expertise and modularity). Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected from 140 small Spanish firms involved in two sectors characterized by the offer of customized solutions: information and professional, scientific and technical services. Findings Analysis reveals that customer involvement in the customized solution, even when it requires investing in equipment, time or human resources has a positive effect on customization and ultimately on profitability, as the cost of this customer interaction is lower than the revenue it provides. Likewise, supplier investment in the relationship allows for a solution that is adapted to the client, although it requires a cost associated with investing in specific assets. Such costs cancel out the positive indirect effect through the customized solution. Finally, expertise enables appropriate use of the flexibility derived from modularity to satisfy customer requirements, with both being key company resources for driving profitability through customized solutions. Originality/value This study makes a contribution to the domain of customization.

"Purpose - The current research aims to analyze antecedents and consequences of using the information provided by customers involved in new service development (NSD). It also seeks to examine the moderating effect of technological turbulence on the antecedents and consequences of information use. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from service firms in a variety of industrial sectors. Unit of analysis was a NSD project in which current or potential customers were involved during its development process. A self-administered mail survey was used to collect the data. A total of 102 complete questionnaires were returned. The proposed model was tested using partial least squares. Findings - The results indicate that the instrumental use of the information collected from customers involved in NSD can lead to higher service advantage and service newness and in turn to higher market performance. Findings reveal that higher recording and reviewing of information collected from customers involved in NSD result in greater use of the information during the NSD process. An important result is that under technologically turbulent environments, recording and reviewing information from customers involved in NSD is less likely to result in a higher instrumental use of such information. Finally, the authors' results show that when technological turbulence is high the instrumental use of information from customers involved in NSD has lower value for both service advantage and service newness. Originality/value - Findings confirm the importance of customer involvement for NSD in a business context. Using the information from customers involved in NSD to resolve specific problems or make decisions regarding NSD projects can result in enhanced service performance. Moreover, information processing capabilities are key antecedents to instrumental information use.

"Purpose This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework based on transaction cost economics that identifies key factors shaping public agencies' governance of supplier relationships and related performance implications. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents an extended transaction cost framework for research on public procurement (PP) with a corresponding set of propositions. Transaction cost theory and specific features of and challenges to the PP function identified in extant literature constitute the main elements of the framework. Findings This conceptual paper makes three sets of proposals. First, public agencies tend to rely on market governance of supplier relationships and when PP deploys non-market governance, such governance tends to be of a unilateral (vs bilateral) kind. Second, increases in purchasing competence and autonomy of PP and particularly if implemented in tandem, will reduce PP's overreliance on market governance and increase PP's use of non-market governance. Third, PP should perform better for less complex transactions - and when contracting complexity relates to safeguarding of specific assets rather than when complexity relates to environmental and behavioral uncertainty. Increases in competence and autonomy should increase PP's performance, particularly for complex transactions. Practical implications Public agencies may be in a better position to align governance solutions with transaction complexities by developing their procurement competence, decentralizing procurement decisions and increasing the flexibility of national and international procurement regulations. Private companies selling to public agencies need to be aware of and able to adapt to PP practices such as extensive use of market governance and unilateral governance as the primary form of non-market governance. Social implications The paper discusses how public agencies can improve procurement performance through better alignment of governance of supplier relationships with transaction attributes and thereby increase the quality of public services. Originality/value The paper relies on a well-established theoretical perspective, enabling identification (and, potentially, correction) of governance misalignment in the public sector.","Rokkan, AI; Haugland, SA",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-09-2019-0393,Public sector; Governance; Procurement; Transaction costs,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper develops a theoretical framework that aims to improve public procurement governance and performance, addressing long-term implications and aligning governance solutions with transaction complexities, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-ai,65,20,A transaction cost approach for public procurement,2022
"In this research, we investigate the behavior of Cronbach's coefficient alpha and its new standard error. We systematically analyze the effects of sample size, scale length, strength of item intercorrelations, and scale dimensionality. We demonstrate the beneficial effects of sample size on alpha's standard error and of scale length and the strengths of item intercorrelations (effects that are substitutes in their benefits) on both alpha and its standard error. Our findings also speak to this adage: Heterogeneity within the item covariance matrix (e.g., through multidimensionality or poor items) negatively impacts reliability by decreasing the precision of the estimation. We also examined the question of equilibrium scale length, showing the conditions for which it is optimal to add no items, or one, or multiple items to a scale. In terms of best practices, we recommend that researchers report a confidence interval or standard error along with the coefficient alpha point estimate.","Duhachek, A; Coughlan, AI; Iacobucci, D",Not identified,10.1287/mksc.1040.0097,measurement; survey research; reliability; coefficient alpha,35.0,,10,35,INFORMS,The abstract discusses statistical analysis and reliability measurement rather than marketing or strategic decision-making.

"Purpose: The analysis of the content of publications concerning decision-making processes in an enterprise indicates that one of the tasks of modern management is to identify effective solutions based on the synergy of human and technological resources that support decision-making processes. This also applies to marketing, which is subject to virtualization related both to its concept and instruments, as well as marketing activities. The purpose of the paper is to show the role of artificial intelligence and human talent in decision making in the field of marketing in an enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: Critical literature review; the research procedure that is based on the review of the literature is focused on formulating the answers to the following questions: - What factors determine the effective implementation of artificial intelligence as a technology supporting decision-making processes in the sphere of marketing in enterprises? - What are the identified models of application of artificial intelligence and human talent in making decisions in enterprises? Findings: The use of the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence in supporting marketing decisions brings many benefits, but it also requires overcoming mental and cultural barriers. It should be emphasized that relying on artificial intelligence in decision-making processes does not mean eliminating people, especially the talented ones, because it is the employee who can revise the decision-making criteria or state that the algorithm on the basis of which decisions are made in the company is outdated. Research limitations/implications: Empirical verification of the proposed model would allow for identifying the role performed by talented employees and algorithms in decision-making processes in the era of development of innovative IT solutions along with determination of the hierarchy of factors stimulating these processes. Originality/value: Proposing a model of determinants and types of solutions that allow for effectively combining human resources described as talent and artificial intelligence in making decisions in the field of marketing in enterprises is the result of the considerations provided in the paper.","Sobocinska, M",Strategic,10.7172/1644-9584.91.5,talent; artificial intelligence; machine learning; marketing,5.0,,10,0,"UNIV WARSAW, FAC MANAGEMENT","The abstract discusses the role of artificial intelligence and human talent in decision-making processes in marketing, indicating a focus on long-term strategies and the integration of technology and human resources to achieve effective decision-making.

"The article has dealt with the current trends of communication aspects of company's relations with the customers. The emphasis is placed on the necessity to review the companies' marketing strategies, in particular, due to communication constraints and the corresponding changes in the format of both direct and feedback with the customers. Restrictive measures have changed the format of competition, having created the conditions for its concentration in cyberspace. Changes in the nature of interpersonal communication predetermined by the limited personal activity and the introduction of remote forms of interaction, have generated demand for innovative ways of communication with customers. Other factors that require the adjustment of marketing strategies include the emergence of new behavioral capabilities of consumers associated with the intensive development of digital communication channels. It has been noted that in the digital communication environment, digital platforms provide the main format of communication with the existing customer base and potential customers. In addition, prompt acquisition and processing of data on purchasing behavior of customers allows companies to increase significantly the sensitivity of marketing research and optimize their own marketing decisions. Among the areas of increasing targeting and personalization of product offerings, the use of elements of artificial intelligence and voice search has been accentuated. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence greatly facilitates and simplifies the work of marketers on the processing and initial analysis of the growing flow of digital marketing data, as well as provides greater efficiency. It has been concluded that widespread use of voice assistants in e-commerce requires companies to rethink radically their approaches to internal data processing, IT investment and customer engagement strategies. Active integration of chatbots into various communication platforms is able to make them universal tools for both business and consumers, which will allow them to become a familiar part of the user experience. Implementation of virtual reality and augmented reality elements in the interface of company websites can significantly diversify the process of collecting information by users and push them to unplanned purchases. It has been indicated that the growing standards of personalization and new rules of customer confidentiality will continue to require companies to be flexible and introduce new technologies in order to adapt permanently their business to new conditions. Focusing on building trust with customers based on digital communications will enable companies to create a long-term integrated marketing strategy and concentrate on the multi-channel nature of customer experience.","Hnoievyi, VH; Koren, OM",Strategic,10.32342/2074-5354-2021-1-54-5,marketing strategy; digital marketing; innovations; personalization; digital channels; artificial intelligence; voice search; virtual reality; augmented reality,5.0,,10,0,ALFRED NOBEL UNIV,The abstract discusses the need for companies to rethink their marketing strategies and adapt to changes in customer communication and behavior.

"PurposeThis work aims to examine the communication on Twitter of the most responsible companies in Spain to identify the topics covered on corporate social responsibility (CSR) from the perspective of happiness and social marketing. In addition, the profiles of the messages that show an association with the impact of the messages have been identified.Design/methodology/approachAn empirical analysis of the Twitter posts of Spain's ten most responsible companies has been carried out. The methodology of this work combines data mining techniques, sentiment analysis and content analysis, both from a quantitative and qualitative approach.FindingsThe results show that most brand tweets do not deal with CSR-related topics. The topics they address the most are those related to sports and the weather. From the perspective of social marketing, conversational-type tweets are the most published and have achieved the most significant reaction from the public. In addition, four messages' profiles have been identified based on the company and the emotional connotation associated with the impact, giving rise to more outstanding promotion of social causes.Originality/valueOur main contribution to this work has been to value positive communication and social marketing to promote better CSR on Twitter.

"The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, such as recommendation agents, presents new challenges and opportunities for marketing. Recommendation agents assist consumers in their online grocery shopping decisions by analyzing data on preferences and behaviors. This research highlights that while recommendation agents can reduce choice overload and make purchase decisions easier for consumers, they are also associated with higher uncertainty in decision-making. Three experimental studies confirmed that purchases aided by recommendation agents are perceived as more uncertain and reduced perceptions of control over the choices explain this outcome. Furthermore, lower choice satisfaction and purchase intentions are confirmed as consequences of perceived uncertainty. Personal characteristics such as risk aversion and maximization tendencies are considered boundary conditions for these effects.","Rohden, SF; Espartel, LB",Operational,10.1007/s10660-024-09808-7,Smart retailing; Artificial intelligence; Choice overload; Maximization tendencies; Risk perception,10.0,,60,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the use of recommendation agents in online grocery shopping, focusing on day-to-day consumer decision-making and the management of choices influenced by AI technology.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,20,Consumer reactions to technology in retail: choice uncertainty and reduced perceived control in decisions assisted by recommendation agents,2024
"Purpose The transition to omnichannel retail is the recognized future of retail, which uses digital technologies (e.g. augmented reality shopping assistants) to enhance the customer shopping experience. However, retailers struggle with the implementation of such technologies in brick-and-mortar stores. Against this background, the present study investigates the impact of a smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant application, which uses personalized recommendations and explainable artificial intelligence features on customer shopping experiences. Design/methodology/approach The authors follow a design science research approach to develop a shopping assistant application artifact, evaluated by means of an online experiment (n = 252), providing both qualitative and quantitative data. Findings Results indicate a positive impact of the augmented reality shopping assistant application on customers' perception of brick-and-mortar shopping experiences. Based on the empirical insights this study also identifies possible improvements of the artifact. Research limitations/implications This study's assessment is limited to an online evaluation approach. Therefore, future studies should test actual usage of the technology in brick-and-mortar stores. Contrary to the suggestions of established theories (i.e. technology acceptance model, uses and gratification theory), this study shows that an increase of shopping experience does not always convert into an increase in the intention to purchase or to visit a brick-and-mortar store. Additionally, this study provides novel design principles and ideas for crafting augmented reality shopping assistant applications that can be used by future researchers to create advanced versions of such applications. Practical implications This paper demonstrates that a shopping assistant artifact provides a good opportunity to enhance users' shopping experience on their path-to-purchase, as it can support customers by providing rich information (e.g. explainable recommendations) for decision-making along the customer shopping journey. Originality/value This paper shows that smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant applications have the potential to increase the competitive power of brick-and-mortar retailers.","Zimmermann, R; Mora, D; Cirqueira, D; Helfert, M; Bezbradica, M; Werth, D; Weitzl, WJ; Riedl, R; Auinger, A",Tactical,10.1108/JRIM-09-2021-0237,Digital retail; Digital shopping assistant; Recommender systems; Explainable artificial intelligence; Retail sales,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on the development and evaluation of a smartphone-based augmented reality shopping assistant application, which aligns with tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into practical implementations and targets for enhancing customer shopping experiences.",wos-artificial intelligence,15,65,Enhancing brick-and-mortar store shopping experience with an augmented reality shopping assistant application using personalized recommendations and explainable artificial intelligence,2023
"Up to the present, various methods such as data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have been used to get the best assessment from huge and important data resources. Deep learning, one of these methods, is an extended version of artificial neural networks. Within the scope of this study, a model has been developed to classify the success of tele-marketing with different machine learning algorithms, especially with deep learning algorithms. Naive Bayes, C5.0, Extreme Learning Machine, and Deep Learning algorithms have been used for modelling. To examine the effect of class label distribution on model success, synthetic minority oversampling technique has been used. The results have revealed the success of deep learning and decision trees algorithms. When the data set was not balanced, the deep learning algorithm performed better in terms of sensitivity.

"Undoubtedly, customer relationship management has gained its importance through the statement that acquiring a new customer is several times more costly than retaining and selling additional products to existing customers. Consequently, marketing practitioners are currently often focusing on retaining customers for as long as possible. However, recent findings in relationship marketing literature have shown that large differences exist within the group of long-life customers in terms of spending and spending evolution. Therefore, this paper focuses on introducing a measure of a customer's future spending evolution that might improve relationship marketing decision making. In this study, from a marketing point of view, we focus on predicting whether a newly acquired customer will increase or decrease his/her future spending from initial purchase information. This is essentially a classification task. The main contribution of this study lies in comparing and evaluating several Bayesian network classifiers with statistical and other artificial intelligence techniques for the purpose of classifying customers in the binary classification problem at hand. Certain Bayesian network classifiers have been recently proposed in the artificial intelligence literature as probabilistic white-box classifiers which allow to give a clear insight into the relationships between the variables of the domain under study. We discuss and evaluate several types of Bayesian network classifiers and their corresponding structure learning algorithms. We contribute to the literature by providing experimental evidence that: (1) Bayesian network classifiers offer an interesting and viable alternative for our customer lifecycle slope estimation problem; (2) the Markov Blanket concept allows for a natural form of attribute selection that was very effective for the application at hand; (3) the sign of the slope can be predicted with a powerful and parsimonious general, unrestricted Bayesian network classifier; (4) a set of three variables measuring the volume of initial purchases and the degree to which customers originally buy in different categories, are powerful predictors for estimating the sign of the slope, and might therefore provide desirable additional information for relationship marketing decision making.

"Purpose This research set out to examine how financial advice provided by a human advisor (vs robo-advisor) influences investment intentions in a retail banking context. Design/methodology/approach In two experiments, between-subjects experimental designs were employed to test the primary hypothesis and identify the underlying causal mechanisms that influence consumer investment decisions. Findings The results from two experiments indicate consumers have more belief in financial advice provided by a human financial advisor (vs robo-advisor), when the level of involvement is high. The authors also identify customer belief in the information and the customer's perception of the bank's customer focus as the causal mechanisms that have downstream effects on investment intentions. Originality/value This research is the first to examine how financial advice received from a human advisor (vs robo-advisor) influences investment intentions in a retail banking context. Furthermore, this research identifies high involvement as a key boundary condition moderating the effects on investment intention and identifies consumer belief in the advice, as well as the bank's perceived level of customer focus as the causal mechanisms influencing investment intentions.","Northey, G; Hunter, V; Mulcahy, R; Choong, K; Mehmet, M",Tactical,10.1108/IJBM-09-2021-0439,Artificial intelligence; Banking; Trust; Customer orientation; Robo-advisor,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The research examines how financial advice influences consumer investment intentions, fitting into tactical decision-making by interpreting strategic goals into structured actions that can directly affect customer engagement and investment behavior.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,70,Man vs machine: how artificial intelligence in banking influences consumer belief in financial advice,2022
"Competition between marketing strategies of enterprises shifts to the use of artificial intelligence and begins to be considered in the context of competition between Data Science projects. Therefore, the issue of developing methodology and building a model in a particular area is relevant, which will make the project quite effective and ensure the achievement of goals for the company. The banking services market has a certain specificity of consumer behaviour, so forming marketing strategies is a somewhat complex process. Thus, banks face the task of maintaining the loyalty of their existing customers and attracting new ones. This article aims to build a marketing strategy to attract new customers in the banking sector using Data Science tools. The result of the study is the construction of two econometric models of the different bank's credit products: cash loans and credit cards, which determine the influence of various factors on this process and helps to distribute the advertising budget between different types of advertising. Using the built model, it was determined that advertising campaigns directly affect the increase in the number of new customers in the bank and the overall growth of brand knowledge about the banking institution in society. In addition, the determined weights of each influencing factor helped form an advertising budget, which increased customer inflows by 12%, with an average ROI of 3.18. Taking all into account, the model had shown its effectiveness in organising the bank's advertising campaign when decisions were made using Data Science technologies. The results obtained based on the models give a fairly clear understanding of the factors influencing the inflow of new customers in the bank, which will model the distribution of the budget for advertising campaigns in future periods and predict their effectiveness. Competition in the country's financial sector is forcing banking institutions to use data science in their marketing activities.","Zatonatska, T; Hubska, M; Shpyrko, V",Tactical,10.21272/mmi.2022.2-11,bank; marketing activity; advertising; regression; involvement of new clients; Data Science,5.0,,15,0,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY","The abstract discusses the development of marketing strategies using Data Science tools, focusing on specific campaigns, budget allocation, and customer acquisition in the banking sector, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,70,MARKETING STRATEGIES IN THE BANKING SERVICES SECTOR WITH THE HELP OF DATA SCIENCE,2022
"Purpose Artificial neural network (ANN) models, part of the discipline of machine learning and artificial intelligence, are becoming more popular in the marketing literature and in marketing practice. This paper aims to provide a series of tests between ANN models and competing predictive models. Design/methodology/approach A total of 46 pairs of models were evaluated in an objective model-building environment. Either logistic regression or multiple regression models were developed and then were compared to ANN models using the same set of input variables. Three sets of B2B data were used to test the models. Emphasis also was placed on evaluating small samples. Findings ANN models tend to generate model predictions that are more accurate or the same as logistic regression models. However, when ANN models are compared to multiple regression models, the results are mixed. For small sample sizes, the modeling results are the same as for larger samples.

"Customization and personalization services are a critical success factor for Internet stores and Web service providers. This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules For personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique For personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store.

"Purpose Based on the data obtained from a questionnaire of 595 people, the authors explore the relative importance of consumers, checking whether socioeconomic variables influence their centrality, detecting the communities within the network to which they belong, identifying consumption patterns and checking whether there is any relationship between co-marketing and consumer choices. Design/methodology/approach A multilayer network is created from data collected through a consumer survey to identify customers' choices in seven different markets. The authors focus the analysis on a smaller kinship and cohabitation network and apply the LART network community detection algorithm. To verify the association between consumers' centrality and variables related to their respective socioeconomic profile, the authors develop an econometric model to measure their impact on consumer's degree centrality. Findings Based on 595 responses analysing individual consumers, the authors find out which consumers invest and which variables influence consumers' centrality. Using a smaller sample of 70 consumers for whom they know kinship and cohabitation relationships, the authors detect communities with the same consumption patterns and verify that this may be an adequate way to establish co-marketing strategies. Originality/value Network analysis has become a widely used technique in the extraction of knowledge on consumers. This paper's main (and novel) contribution lies in providing a greater understanding on how multilayer networks represent hidden databases with potential knowledge to be considered in business decisions.

"Historically, the fields of Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems grew up from different backgrounds; Management Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence, respectively. As a result, many people still regard them as unrelated fields, although Operational Researchers are working in both of them. Expert Systems in particular have found it difficult to escape from an image of being isolated; not just from Decision Support Systems, but from all other types of computer system. Successful applications appeared to be confined to very well-defined tasks; either small systems for tasks of an operational nature, or large systems requiring expensive specialised computer support. The spread of Expert Systems into management and administrative applications from the scientific/technical domains of the early systems has been very slow. The view put forward in this paper is that for Expert Systems to be applied to problems in management or administration, the traditional 'closed-world' picture of an Expert System is usually inadequate. The real manifestation of the Expert System's role (and indeed that of the human expert) involves much more negotiation and interaction than in scientific/ technical domains. The consequences for the resulting system are that it looks much more like the traditional picture of a Decision Support System than a classic standalone Expert System. The argument will be illustrated by reference to examples of 'Expert System' developments, including systems for production control, crime pattern analysis, telephone marketing, and the drawing up of contracts.","EDWARDS, JS",Not identified,10.1016/0377-2217(92)90273-C,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; PRACTICE,15.0,,10,50,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"The abstract discusses the interplay between Expert Systems and Decision Support Systems, focusing on their historical development and application challenges rather than a specific marketing context.",wos-artificial intelligence,15,10,EXPERT SYSTEMS IN MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION - ARE THEY REALLY DIFFERENT FROM DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,1992
"To be competitive in contemporary turbulent environments, firms must be capable of processing huge amounts of information, and effectively convert it into actionable knowledge. This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis.

"Data capture at point of sale, using laser scanning technology, is now commonplace in retail outlets in developed economies. The volume of data collected is enormous (a single UK grocery superstore carries over 15 000 different lines, each with a unique 13 digit barcode and will sell 600 000 items per week). It has been recognized that, where point of sale data can be translated into meaningful information, there is scope for efficiency savings and exploitable competitive advantage. In UK grocery retailing the uses of scanner data have concentrated on operational aspects such as improved ordering systems and staff scheduling. There have, however, been many recent studies, predominantly in the USA, which have examined, using scanner data, the relationship between marketing variables (price, display, advertising, coupons, and other promotions) and customer purchasing behaviour.

"Artificial Intelligence has the potential to improve human decisions in complex environments, but its effectiveness can remain limited if humans hold context-specific private information. Using the empirical example of antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections, we show that full automation of prescribing fails to improve on physician decisions. Instead, optimally delegating a share of decisions to physicians, where they possess private diagnostic information, effectively utilizes the complementarity between algorithmic and human decisions. Combining physician and algorithmic decisions can achieve a reduction in inefficient overprescribing of antibiotics by 20.3 percent.","Ribers, MA; Ullrich, H",Out of scope,10.1007/s11129-024-09284-1,Human-machine complementarity; Machine learning; Antibiotic resistance; Antibiotic prescribing; C53; D83; I18; I19; L2; M15,0.0,,0,100,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare, specifically in antibiotic prescribing, which is not related to marketing.",wos-artificial intelligence,0,0,Complementarities between algorithmic and human decision-making: The case of antibiotic prescribing,2024
"Analyzing scanner data in brand management activities presents unique difficulties due to the vast quantity of the data. Time series methods that are able to handle the volume effectively often are inappropriate due to the violation of many statistical assumptions in the data characteristics. We examine scanner data sets for three brand categories and examine properties associated with many time series forecasting methods. Many violations are found with respect to linearity, normality, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity. With this in mind we compare the forecasting ability of neural networks that require no assumptions to two of the more robust time series techniques. Neural networks provide similar forecasts to Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR), and both outperform generalized autoregressive conditional herteroscedasticty (GARCH) models.","Jiang, JJ; Zhong, MS; Klein, G",Tactical,10.1111/j.1540-5915.2000.tb00943.x,artificial intelligence; pricing; sales analysis; and statistics,5.0,,15,0,"DECISION SCIENCES INST, GEORGIA STATE UNIV","The abstract discusses the analysis of scanner data and the comparison of forecasting methods, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing analytics and campaign optimization.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,70,Marketing category forecasting: An alternative of BVAR - Artificial neural networks,2000
"The banking sector, like other service sector, improves in accordance with the customer's needs. Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification.

"As the World Wide Web has developed considerable bargaining power has been transferred from suppliers to consumers; there is a real need to improve market intelligence and market research for private and public tourism organisations and facilitate timely consumer decision making. This article explores the development of user generated content and specifically the use of web logs or blogs. Tourism organisations cannot afford to ignore the development of user generated content, peer-to-peer web applications and virtual communities. A recent survey found that consumers trusted more websites with reviews than professional guides and travel agencies and far from being an irrelevance, blogs are often perceived to be more credible and trustworthy than traditional marketing communications. But there is a problem: given the sheer number of possibly relevant travel blogs there is a need to locate, extract and interpret blog content and this has proven so far to be time consuming, exhausting and costly, thus negating the relative value of the information obtained. A way forward may be the use of artificial intelligence and opinion mining'' or a blog visualisation system.","Akehurst, G",Tactical,10.1007/s11628-008-0054-2,User generated content; Blogs; Tourism; Travel; Internet; Marketing,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"The abstract discusses the need for tourism organizations to improve their market intelligence and consumer decision-making through the use of user-generated content and artificial intelligence.

"While organizational frontlines in the digital age involve complex interactions between consumers, autonomous technology (AT), and frontline workers, research so far largely focuses on the effect of AT on either the consumer or the worker. Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer-Autonomous Technology-Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer-worker-AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as ATenabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer-worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker.

"Consumers increasingly encounter recommender systems when making consumption decisions of all kinds. While numerous efforts have aimed to improve the quality of algorithm-generated recommendations, evidence has indicated that people often remain averse to superior algorithmic sources of information in favor of their own personal intuitions (a type II problem). The current work highlights an additional (type I) problem associated with the use of recommender systems: algorithm overdependence. Five experiments illustrate that, stemming from a belief that algorithms hold greater domain expertise, consumers surrender to algorithm-generated recommendations even when the recommendations are inferior. Counter to prior findings, this research indicates that consumers frequently depend too much on algorithm-generated recommendations, posing potential harms to their own well-being and leading them to play a role in propagating systemic biases that can influence other users. Given the rapidly expanding application of recommender systems across consumer domains, the authors believe that an appreciation and understanding of these risks is crucial to the effective guidance and development of recommendation systems that support consumer interests.","Banker, S; Khetani, S",Operational,10.1177/0743915619858057,artificial intelligence; consumer decision making; decision aids; human-computer interaction; recommender systems,5.0,,65,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior in relation to recommender systems, focusing on how they make decisions based on algorithm-generated recommendations.

"In the current phase of artificial intelligence development, more and more attention is being paid to technologies that make autonomous decisions. Little attention has been paid to the customers' and job seekers' perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers' attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers' intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital's unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies. The topic is worth exploring as key market players (such as Oracle) recognize autonomous technologies as the most ground-breaking innovation that will shape business in the coming years.","Modlinski, A",Strategic,10.30924/mjcmi.29.1.5,autonomous systems; intelligent technologies; marketing; innovation; employer branding; customer behavior,5.0,,15,0,"UNIV SPLIT, FAC ECONOMICS","The research addresses long-term implications of autonomous decision-making technologies on customer and job seeker perceptions, aligning with strategic planning in marketing.",wos-artificial intelligence,60,20,TO BOAST OR NOT TO BOAST: THE IMPACT OF ADVERTISING THE USE OF AUTONOMOUS ALGORITHMS TO BANK AND HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES,2024
"Objective: To study the relevance of Instagram posts in the construction of forecasting models for the variation of daily sales revenues for retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Methodology: Time series of daily sales between the years 2017 and 2019 of 10 retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector were considered. Methods based on machine learning were used and the forecasting models were increased with numerical variables from the official profile of the company, from the posting made by the contracted digital influencer and the characteristics of the images posted by the digital influencer were included in the models. Relevance and Originality: The study is innovative, as it goes beyond qualitative reflections on the theme and provides empirical evidence regarding the impacts on forecast accuracy from the inclusion of social media variables. A data fusion strategy (numerics and images) was also presented to forecast daily sales of retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Main results: The models proved to be efficient in forecasting and the importance of the likes and engagement variables reinforces the idea that the identification and social reference generated by the ID are important aspects in the purchase decision process.

"This article investigates the consumer-voice assistant (VA) interaction in the context of food and beverage purchase choices and the role that psychological power plays in the consumer decision-making process. A series of experimental studies demonstrate that both involvement and the psychological condition of power meditate consumers' willingness to purchase.

"In the field of business-to-business marketing, corporate ethical identity and corporate brand identity are crucial subjects for discussion. Business organizations function under social norms, and to establish an ethical identity, they must show corporate ethical responsibility, embrace ethical standards, and maintain open communication with suppliers. While an organization's reputation is impacted by the absence of an ethical identity, its financial success is unaffected. Extant literature has not thrown a spotlight on social and environmental performance which indicates that less focus has been given by academics than by practitioners. To fill the lacuna in the existing literature, this study examines the relationships between corporate ethical identity, corporate brand identity, social and environmental performance. The study uses a deductive research approach and develops hypotheses which are further tested using variance based structural equation modeling. The study offers a distinctive contribution to ethics theory and stakeholder theory by showing that developing an ethical identity requires more than just adhering to moral guidelines and upholding open communication.

"The rapid development of science has ushered the society into the era of the digital economy, profoundly altering the habits and behaviors of empowered digital citizens. This transformation is particularly evident in the financial sector, where Internet companies have spearheaded the growth of Internet finance, offering non-professional, highly autonomous, cost-effective, and accessible financial services. Traditional banks face stiff competition from internal and cross-border rivals, compelling them to embark on digital transformation journeys to stay relevant. This research paper delves into the critical relationship between technology forecasting and social change, exploring the impact of gender imbalances on FinTech innovation. It also examines innovative e-commerce marketing models driven by big data and artificial intelligence, catalyzing advancements in the financial field. The digitalization of banks encompasses multiple facets, including decision-making, ecosystem development, channel optimization, process enhancement, data center construction, and infrastructure fortification. Central to this transformation is the understanding of customer emotions, a task made more intelligent through natural language processing (NLP) technology. We employ NLP techniques to analyze customer voice data and discern emotional states, including one-hot vector representation and Word2Vector models, alongside Bi-LSTM and attention processes.

"PurposeThis study aims to explore the role of frontline service employees' (FSEs) awareness that their job can be substituted by smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms (STARA) in their job autonomy and proactive service performance and when these relationships can be buffered. Drawing on the cognitive appraisal theory of stress, the study examined the mediating relationship between FSEs' STARA awareness, job autonomy and proactive service performance and the moderating effects of self-efficacy and resilience on this relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe authors administered two-wave online surveys to 301 South Korean FSEs working in various service sectors (e.g. retailing, food/beverage, hospitality/tourism and banking). The Time 1 survey measured respondents' STARA awareness, self-efficacy, resilience and job autonomy, and the Time 2 survey assessed their proactive service performance.FindingsFSEs' STARA awareness negatively affected their subsequent proactive service performance through decreased job autonomy. The negative association between STARA awareness and job autonomy was weaker when FSEs' self-efficacy was high than when it was low. While the authors observed no significant moderation of resilience, the author found a marginally significant three-way interaction between STARA awareness, self-efficacy and resilience. Specifically, STARA awareness was negatively related to job autonomy only when both self-efficacy and resilience were low. When either self-efficacy or resilience was high, the association between STARA awareness and job autonomy became nonsignificant, suggesting the buffering roles of the two personal resources.Research limitations/implicationsGiven that the measurement of variables relied on self-reported data, rater biases might have affected the findings of the study. Moreover, the simultaneous measurement of STARA awareness, self-efficacy, resilience and job autonomy could preclude causal inferences between these variables. The authors encourage future studies to use a more rigorous methodology to reduce rater biases and establish stronger causality between the variables.Practical implicationsService firms can decrease FSEs' STARA awareness through training in the knowledge and skills necessary to work with these technologies. To promote FSEs' proactive service performance in this context, service firms need to involve them in decisions related to STARA adoption and allow them to craft their jobs. Service managers should provide FSEs with social support and exercise empowering and supportive leadership to help them view STARA as a challenge rather than a threat.Originality/valueDistinct from prior research on STARA awareness and employee outcomes, the study identified proactive service performance as a key outcome in the STARA context. By presenting self-efficacy and resilience as crucial personal resources that buffer FSEs from the deleterious impact of STARA awareness, the study provides practitioners with insights that can help FSEs maintain their job autonomy and proactive service performance in times of digitalization and automation.","Hur, WM; Shin, Y",Tactical,10.1108/JSM-03-2023-0115,STARA awareness; Self-efficacy; Resilience; Job autonomy; Proactive service performance,0.0,,15,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study examines how frontline service employees' awareness of smart technology affects their job autonomy and proactive service performance, translating strategic goals into actionable insights for managing employees in service industries.",wos-artificial intelligence,20,60,Service employees' STARA awareness and proactive service performance,2024
