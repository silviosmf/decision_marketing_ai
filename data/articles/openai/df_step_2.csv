"In the clothing industry, the main problem of a manager is intelligent decision-making. Artificial neural network tools are an attempt to mimic the capabilities of human brain. A neural network trained in such a way can be invaluable to a manager as a decision making tool. He can use it to verify his hunch about the change required in the process to bring about a desired change in the product property. Specifically, he can use it to decide on apparel pattern design, apparel sewing, apparel comfort, and apparel marketing and merchandising.",Liu J.; Mandal S.,Tactical,,,0.0,,25,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of artificial neural networks as a decision-making tool for managers in the clothing industry.

"In this article, we explore how digital marketers think about marketing in the age of Big Data surveillance, automatic computational analyses, and algorithmic shaping of choice contexts. Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence. The vision of digital marketing is therefore a fascinating one: marketing disappears at precisely the moment when it extends throughout the life without limit. © The Author(s) 2020.",Darmody A.; Zwick D.,Strategic,10.1177/2053951720904112,algorithmic marketing; artificial intelligence; Big Data; consumer empowerment; digital marketing; hypernudging; manipulation; marketing automation; post-marketing; relevance; surveillance capitalism,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses the overarching implications of digital marketing in the context of Big Data and consumer empowerment, indicating a long-term perspective on marketing strategies and goals.",scopus-artificial intelligence,60,25,Manipulate to empower: Hyper-relevance and the contradictions of marketing in the age of surveillance capitalism,2020
"We present strategies for automatically explaining decisions based on Multiattribute Value Theory, the branch of decision theory that addresses tradeoffs among multiple competing objectives. Our explanations are at once empirically motivated and formally sound, retaining the advantages of both artificial-intelligence and decision-theoretic representations for modeling decisions. We demonstrate the explanation strategies with implemented examples in the domains of marketing, process control, and medicine. Although previous approaches to modeling decisions in expert systems often have sacrificed formal specification for transparent operation, our methodology suggests that knowledge engineers can retain the benefits of decision theory without compromising intuitive explanation. © 1994.",Klein D.A.; Shortliffe E.H.,Strategic,10.1016/0004-3702(94)90053-1,,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses strategies for explaining decisions based on Multiattribute Value Theory, which is related to long-term organizational goals and decision support systems.

"This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) for market-driven product positioning and design, based on market data and design parameters. The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"At present, social networks are strongly used for personal or professional purposes. The social networks have accumulated a large amount of information, which can be used in different ways. One of such possible purposes is advertising. In particular, when a company pays for advertising in a social network, it wants to get an ideal deployment of the ads on the network. The ideal behavior aims at reducing the high costs to pay, the number of hours to design advertising, the difficulty in the creation of ads by lots, among other things. In particular, the optimization of the production of advertising on social networks, based on the performance of the ads, is not an easy task. If we make an incorrect design, this can result in losses for a company. In this sense, this paper presents an intelligent system of management of social network advertising, based on data mining techniques, to automatically produce ads. In addition, we test our adaptive mechanism of automated production (generation) of online advertising on Facebook. Our system carries out automatic modifications and improvements of ads. Facebook is one of the more popular social networks, being widely used by companies for advertising, in order to create contents attracting the attention of users. © 2014 IEEE.",Aguilar J.; Garcia G.,Tactical,10.1109/TCSS.2017.2759188,Decision support systems; Facebook; intelligent systems; online advertising; social networks,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of an intelligent system for managing social network advertising, focusing on optimizing ad production based on performance data.

"Marketing activity by distributors is a significant factor in attracting audiences to theaters before a movie is released. Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy. In this study, we propose a model that predicts audience numbers on the opening Saturday using market research data obtained through online and offline surveys to help distributors develop better marketing strategies. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters",An Y.; An J.; Cho S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.05.005,Artificial intelligence; Box office; Decision support system; Machine learning; Marketing,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the development of a model to predict audience numbers for better marketing strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making to interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-artificial intelligence,20,65,Artificial intelligence-based predictions of movie audiences on opening Saturday,2021
"Marketing decision support systems (MDSS) incorporate both internal and external data in performing analytics to improve business effectiveness. Weather data have long been considered a crucial external data input in practitioners’ marketing strategy; however, academic research on how weather conditions affect consumer behaviors has been limited. To fill this gap, this research investigates how weather parameters, including sunlight, temperature, and air quality, can be incorporated into MDSS to predict consumers’ variety-seeking in their purchases using public weather data and supermarket panel data for five typical retail products. Our analyses show that weather conditions are associated with greater variety-seeking behavior. The results afford insights into how to exploit weather data for data analytics and employ weather targeting strategies to save promotional expenses and increase profitability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Tian J.; Zhang Y.; Zhang C.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2018.02.001,China big data; Data analytics; Marketing decision support system; Mehrabian-Russell model; Variety-seeking; Weather data,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses how weather data can be integrated into marketing decision support systems to enhance consumer purchasing strategies and behavior, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions such as campaign automation, marketing analytics, and advanced targeting.",scopus-artificial intelligence,10,70,Predicting consumer variety-seeking through weather data analytics,2018
"The banking sector, like other service sector, improves in accordance with the customer’s needs. Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.

"Intelligent manufacturing systems involve the application of artificial intelligence to improve productivity and systematize a wide range of manufacturing activities, that is, from order booking to the design, production, and marketing. Traditional approach of applying intelligent techniques to solve complex manufacturing problems is to build an expert system. Conventional process of building an expert systems is labor intensive to elicit knowledge from the human experts. We thus propose a novel technique of automatic knowledge acquisition by means of the data mining method to remedy the problem and help supporting intelligent manufacturing systems. Knowledge in our tool can be discovered from the stored data using the decision tree induction algorithm. The learned tree structure is then transformed to a rule set that can be integrated into the knowledge base. The implementation of our knowledge acquisition tool is based on the logic programming scheme. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

"To be competitive in contemporary turbulent environments, firms must be capable of processing huge amounts of information, and effectively convert it into actionable knowledge. This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Orriols-Puig A.; Martínez-López F.J.; Casillas J.; Lee N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.03.005,Genetic fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; KDD; Management support; Unsupervised learning,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of an intelligent system utilizing fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms for discovering associations in marketing and business databases.

"The optimal product design is an NP-hard marketing optimization problem, in which a firm aims at the maximization of its market share or profit. A manager that deals with the problem has to decide on a number of issues, such as how to simulate the consumer choice process, which optimization algorithm to apply, and how to model the competitors' retaliatory moves. The existing information systems fail to provide the decision maker with the unique blend of techniques and resources required by the problem. In order to follow the way that marketing managers comprehend the optimal product process, in this paper the problem is broken down into distinct services, each one of them maps into a basic feature (simulation, optimization, competition analysis, etc.). All services are aggregated to a marketing decision support system by a service oriented architecture, achieving this way a decision-makers friendly environment, since the marketing managers are able to get a solution without the need to transfer data and parameters from one software to another, and without the need to coordinate manually the whole process.

"Data mining involves extracting interesting patterns from data and can be found at the heart of operational research (OR), as its aim is to create and enhance decision support systems. Even in the early days, some data mining approaches relied on traditional OR methods such as linear programming and forecasting, and modern data mining methods are based on a wide variety of OR methods including linear and quadratic optimization, genetic algorithms and concepts based on artificial ant colonies. The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance.

"Enterprises comprise several functions, such as production, marketing, sales, human resources, logistics, safety and environment, which interact with each other. As a result, decision-making becomes highly challenging in the alignment of decisions to support the success of business goals. Specifically, environmental management is closely related to several levels in the enterprise structure, since they share a large amount of data and information. Hence, effective integration of environmental issues by means of tools improving information sharing and communication, may play a crucial role for the enhanced enterprise operation from an environmental perspective. In this sense, knowledge management technologies have proved to be highly promising for supporting this integration task. In this work, an ontological framework is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models sharing for the environmental assessment of the enterprise. The ontological model is applied to a case study considering a supply chain network design-planning and a process scheduling problem. The ontology provides an enterprise decision-making supporting tool by combining different information systems, which adapts and recognizes the different elements associated with the enterprise functions, and facilitates assessing the environmental performance of enterprises. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Today, extensive quantitative modelling of the performance of marketing activities is possible due to the availability of rich data sets on product sales and related marketing actions. However, there are a number of product categories for which only inaccurate sales figures or data about marketing efforts exist (e.g., because a significant part of the sales is realized in stores without scanners or which do not make the data available to firm outsiders). In such cases, reliable quantitative findings about the impact of marketing-mix variables on sales may not be achievable but qualitative reasoning may, at least, indicate likely implications of past or planned marketing activities in terms of directions of change. Even in markets with good data qualitative reasoning may be a worthwhile first modelling approach when market conditions change so significantly that a previously used model is deemed unsatisfactory and not enough data exist yet for a specification of a revised quantitative model. We show specifically how qualitative reasoning can be used to diagnose and predict market share changes.

"This case study uses two story-telling methods for analysis – an advanced hermeneutic framework and an extended form of decision systems analysis (DSA) incorporating cognitive mapping – to explore the strategic thought in building a software house around a philosophy of “best practice” application development. The paper explores decision-making for turning an ambitious vision (automation of enterprise-based sales and marketing activities) into a focused application (pricing configuration software), and then into a large software house (Trilogy) offering enterprise e-commerce suites. Trilogy’s management team’s decision-making was heavily influenced by a strong perception that the organization needed to take risks to achieve “critical mass” in anticipation of a convergence of “back-office” and “front-office” applications into one market. The advanced case study also addresses Trilogy’s transition of its applications into Internet environments, plus the transformation of the organization from a product-orientation to a strictly industry-based business and application development perspective.

"Emerging technologies and services stand poised to transform the transportation system, with large implications for energy use and mobility. The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women's preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Spurlock C.A.; Sears J.; Wong-Parodi G.; Walker V.; Jin L.; Taylor M.; Duvall A.; Gopal A.; Todd A.,Strategic,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.014,Automated vehicles; Car-sharing; Electric vehicles; Ride-hailing; Technology adoption; Transportation decisions,5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of emerging technologies on transportation systems, including factors influencing adoption patterns and potential market growth, which align with strategic planning.",scopus-automation,60,20,"Describing the users: Understanding adoption of and interest in shared, electrified, and automated transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area",2019
"This article considers the link between the increasingly important role of automated information curation online and the rise of what we call ‘commercial populism’. We invoke the term to refer to the convergence of populism as a marketing tool–a way of selling, for example, nutritional supplements or survivalist merchandise–with political strategies that cater to the citizen as consumer (whose freedoms are framed in the individual register of personal taste unfettered from civic concerns or constraints). Perhaps unsurprisingly in this context, we draw on the example of Donald Trump's political rise, which while not unrelated to his particular idiosyncrasies, demonstrates how the automated curation of social media aligns itself with what the aggressive rise of commercial populism. The goal of such an analysis is to consider how the combination of hyper-commercialism with the formal attributes of social media contributes to inter-related political pathologies of polarization and conspiracy theory. The consumer-oriented model of personal taste catered to by algorithmic curation highlights the paradox of ‘social’ media: they promise to enhance the social by displacing or reframing it fundamental a-social. The offloading of social decisions and formation onto commercial, automated systems for curating news and information reinforces this version of individualism, contributing to the forms of misrecognition that enable it. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Volcic Z.; Andrejevic M.,Strategic,10.1080/09502386.2022.2042581,automation; Donald Trump; filter bubble; political polarization; Populism; social media,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of automated information curation and its relationship with commercial populism, suggesting a broader analysis of societal and political trends rather than immediate tactical or operational decisions.",scopus-automation,60,20,Automated media and commercial populism,2023

"Unpredictable market conditions have forced textile sector to change the way of thinking and to introduce new technologies in order to increase marketing effects by quick and right decisions, shorter production cycles and more intense communications. Production cycle can be shortened in the phase of product designing and selecting, sampling, production and distribution. But how can the manufacturer decide for a certain product quickly and correctly? Primarily by using CAD/CAM system during the whole process, from idea, pattern, eleboration of technical data, sampling, preparation of production to final production. Another very important factor that additionally increases the importance of CAD/CAM systems is the globalization of the entire production process. Data transmission via internet is quick and considerably facilitates communications between buyers and manufacturers and remote production units. Textile CAD/CAM systems are mainly modularly structured and cover dobby weaving, jacquard weaving and all other textile fields. Optionally available are the packages for 3D simulation and marketing, compact discs with patterns and collections catalogues and virtual fashion shows. Systems for dobby and jacquard weaving are highly improved and simulations in proper density and by considering all constructional parameters look quite realistic. The paper presents some CAD/CAM systems, their features and advantages. The future will be characterized by full automation of the process from the buyer's order to the final production of fabric, which means immediate response and higher flexibility.",Bojic M.B.,Tactical,,CAD/CAM systems; Communication; Designing of dobby fabrics; Designing of jacquard fabrics; Fabric simulation; Internet integration; ITMA,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the implementation of CAD/CAM systems in the textile industry to improve decision-making processes, streamline production cycles, and enhance communication.

"Purpose - This paper, with part 1, aims to investigate the opinions of professionals working in the fashion industry on the future (i.e. next ten to 20 years) of fashion production and retailing. Design/methodology/approach - Data in the form of essays were collected from 62 professionals. The constant comparative method and open coding were used in analysis of the data. Findings - Advances in technology were identified as a driving force behind changes in fashion production and retailing. The total automation and wide adoption of mass customization were foreseen, along with continuous improvement to information technology. Some participants predicted that most production would continue to be sourced offshore. Others believed that apparel production would remain and even grow within the USA. To counter global competition, several strategies were identified. While online shopping was predicted to increase, brick and mortar stores would remain. Through the combination of different types of stores, new types of store would emerge, and consolidation of retail businesses would continue. Future consumer preferences as well as strategies to become competitive retailers were identified. Practical implications - The findings can help academics in developing research ideas and making curricular decisions. Originality/value - The examination of professionals' opinions in this paper may provide insights into the future useful for making decisions on career directions, selecting educational experiences, making investments, and planning strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Kim E.; Johnson K.K.P.,Strategic,10.1108/13612020910957752,Fashion industry; Forecasting; Production management; Retailing; United States of America,15.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the future of fashion production and retailing, focusing on long-term trends and changes driven by technology and consumer preferences.

"Objective: The objective was to review and integrate available research about the construct of state-level suspicion as it appears in social science literatures and apply the resulting findings to information technology (IT) contexts. Background: Although the human factors literature is replete with articles about trust (and distrust) in automation, there is little on the related, but distinct, construct of ""suspicion"" (in either automated or IT contexts). The construct of suspicion-its precise definition, theoretical correlates, and role in such applications-deserves further study. Method: Literatures that consider suspicion are reviewed and integrated. Literatures include communication, psychology, human factors, management, marketing, information technology, and brain/neurology. We first develop a generic model of state-level suspicion. Research propositions are then derived within IT contexts. Results: Fundamental components of suspicion include (a) uncertainty, (b) increased cognitive processing (e.g., generation of alternative explanations for perceived discrepancies), and (c) perceptions of (mal)intent. State suspicion is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of these three components. Our analysis also suggests that trust inhibits suspicion, whereas distrust can be a catalyst of state-level suspicion. Based on a three-stage model of state-level suspicion, associated research propositions and questions are developed. These propositions and questions are intended to help guide future work on the measurement of suspicion (self-report and neurological), as well as the role of the construct of suspicion in models of decision making and detection of deception. Conclusion: The study of suspicion, including its correlates, antecedents, and consequences, is important. We hope that the social sciences will benefit from our integrated definition and model of state suspicion. The research propositions regarding suspicion in IT contexts should motivate substantial research in human factors and related fields.

"The wood products industry is facing increasing challenges from global competition, and automation of manufacturing can greatly help companies in the industry to handle such challenges. Investments in automation of manufacturing are more likely to succeed if they are the expression of informed and systematic decisions. This paper aims to increase the knowledge on the process leading to investment decisions on automation of manufacturing in the wood products industry, as well as on the aspects considered in such processes. A real-time case study was conducted at a large Swedish wood manufacturing company to gain in-depth understanding of decisions related to automation investments. The findings demonstrate that mainly representatives from manufacturing and marketing functions were involved throughout the investment project's length. This could be a contributing factor to the narrow view on automation of manufacturing when decisions are made, where focus is placed on financial and technological aspects. The findings further show a limited knowledge regarding automation of manufacturing, which resulted in a tendency to heavily rely on the technical supplier’s recommendations.

"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers. Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems, and other issues. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.",Kalaignanam K.; Varadarajan R.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-011-0291-0,Cross-border outsourcing; Customer relationship management; Global marketing; International marketing; Offshore outsourcing; Offshoring,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications and considerations of CRM offshore outsourcing, including the conceptual model of antecedents and consequences, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals.",scopus-automation,60,20,Offshore outsourcing of customer relationship management: Conceptual model and propositions,2012
"Automated products that take over tasks that consumers used to carry out themselves are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but consumers continue to resist such innovations. Drawing on the status quo bias as a theoretical framework, this article investigates the role of nostalgia in consumer reactions to product automation in a series of six experiments with almost 1500 participants. The first four experiments converge on a consistent finding: a high (versus low) degree of automation reduces consumers' nostalgic feelings about past consumption episodes, which in turn decrease nostalgia-prone consumers' product evaluations. Against this backdrop, we conduct two additional experiments to determine how firms' communication tactics can overcome the negative role of nostalgia proneness in consumer reactions to automated products. We conclude that managers involved in the marketing of automated products should assess the level of nostalgia in their target groups, and align both their intended positioning for the automated product and the decision to automate critical tasks within the product design that may evoke nostalgic feelings in consumers. Furthermore, when consumers are nostalgia-prone, managers should craft their launch communication tactics such that the focus is diverted from the automated task itself. © 2022 The Authors.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine private households’ preferences for service bundles in the German energy market. Design/methodology/approach: This investigation is based on survey data collected from 3,663 customers of seven mainly municipal energy suppliers in the German energy market. The data set was analyzed via a binary logistic regression model to identify the most prospective customers and their preferences regarding bundles of energy services. Findings: The results indicate that potential adopters of energy-related service bundles have greater prior knowledge about service bundles; place higher importance on simplified handling, flat rates and long price guarantees; prefer to purchase a service bundle from an energy supplier; live in urban areas and have a gas tariff; are both less likely to have a green electricity tariff and to support the German energy transition; have a greater intention to purchase a smart home product; are less likely to already be prosumers; and prefer customer centers and social media as communication channels with energy providers. Practical implications: This paper offers several implications for decision-makers in developing marketing strategies for bundled offerings in a highly competitive energy market.

"Building from related interdisciplinary theories, this research identifies social influence–related variables that are linked to customer relationship management (CRM) technology utilization within an international business-to-business field sales force. Field sales employees (n = 147) in a multinational organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were surveyed to test the research model. Four of 7 primary hypotheses were supported, predicting more than 65% of the variance in the research model. Effort expectancy, uncertainty avoidance, collective performance expectancy, and internal/organizational social influence all showed antecedent significance to contextual utilization of CRM technology. The results of this study suggest that group-oriented individual decision making and the related concept of institutional collectivism are equally as important as individual-oriented decision making in the international utilization of organizational technology. Based on the strong significance shown in the results of this study, it would also be wise to consider cultural value–derived uncertainty avoidance in practical development of training and implementation of multinational CRM systems. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Baker D.S.,Strategic,10.1080/15332667.2014.965650,culture; customer relationship management; international; marketing; normative; sales; sales force automation; social influence; technology acceptance; technology utilization,5.0,,10,0,Routledge,"The research focuses on understanding social influence variables in CRM technology utilization, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and the nature of business relationships in an international context.",scopus-automation,70,15,Social Influence and Contextual Utilization of Customer Relationship Management Technology in an International Field Sales Organization,2014

"Despite the considerable attention being placed on the potential payoff's from programmable manufacturing technologies, remarkably little systematic research has been conducted on organizational plans, decisions, and associated actions. The 1982-83 factory automation surveys project of the Boston University Manufacturing Roundtable reported on here was designed to develop a broad managerial view of computer-aided manufacturing processes in the US. Our purpose was to create a body of information, drawn from the recent experience of leading-edge practitioners, that would begin to describe the range of behaviors accompanying the adoption and implementation of automation technologies, such as advanced numerical control, CAD/CAM and robots, which may be combined to form the ""factory of the future"". In short, we wanted to identify the kinds of progress being made by these manufacturers and the barriers that they, and those who are contemplating such process innovations, will face in the future. In each of our three surveys we had a specific target population in mind. The ""user"" survey was aimed at discrete-part manufacturing organizations that were leaders in adopting factory automation technologies. This survey was designed to address ""best practice"" at the level of a single strategic business unit and deals with specific automation projects. Our ""supplier"" survey was aimed at the major producers of each of the various factory automation technologies. Here we sought the observations and opinions of senior marketing executives in those firms with the most success (and therefore experience) in supplying computer-based manufacturing technologies. Finally, our ""expert"" survey was designed to test some of our preliminary findings from the users and suppliers, including insights gathered from in-depth follow-up telephone interviews with respondents to those two surveys. We intentionally tried to identify a broad sample of individuals whose views would be based on extensive factory automation experience in different capacities. Respondents to our three surveys consisted of 57 users, 38 suppliers and 64 experts. Findings from the three surveys form certain patterns that transcend the isolated facts commonly presented in the literature. The dominant impressions that emerged from the data were:. Leading-edge users of computer-aided manufacturing processes believe in learning by doing. Most have proceeded in an incremental fashion to develop an internal base of experience with factory automation technologies. They tend to have supportive management and a sense of where they are heading. Their current measurement capabilities, however, restrict the basis for making adoption decisions as well as the subsequent evaluation of impacts from recent technological innovations. These users usually rely heavily on outside suppliers for critical technical assistance and consider reliability factors to be more important than price in selecting a vendor. They generally feel they cannot afford to postpone decisions until improved technologies become available. Current leadingedge users will strongly affect the future direction of these technologies. Suppliers claim that most manufacturers are not sophisticated customers. They would like potential users to be more aware of their needs for improved manufacturing processes and to be more interested in the long-term strategic benefits of computer-aided manufacturing technologies already on the market. A classic dilemma seems to have arisen: decisions to adopt expensive factory automation technologies are often made by managers who lack the background to assess technological options, while staff familiar with the new technologies are less able to appreciate associated strategic dimensions. A likely outcome is a decision that is either short-sighted or misguided. Suppliers with limited direct experience in new applications of their technologies and little indepth knowledge of the business situations of their customers cannot be expected to help users avoid such errors. The most difficult problems in achieving computer integrated manufacturing are managerial rather than technical. Manufacturers contemplating factory automation face different issues depending on whether they adopt a retrofit strategy using existing production systems or whether they attempt to make a fresh start as new facilities are brought on stream. In either case, they often have inadequate internal technical resources, strong barriers to communication across traditional functional lines, and a reward structure that does not encourage risk-taking in the interest of long-term strategic gains. Manufacturing organizations that do not deal directly with these kinds of managerial problems are not likely to succeed in factory automation, even if appropriate technological options exist. These functions suggest that manufacturing managers ought to reflect on their organization's current strengths and weaknesses as they formulate a strategy for factory automation. In particular, they should begin with a healthy concern for the adequacy of their current base of knowledge, mix of human resources and formal measurement systems. They should also refine their expectations for integrated factory automation applications, to be sure that general goals such as ""enhanced flexibility"" have explicit operational meanings. Finally, they should improve their organization's ability to identify types of indirect costs, as well as benefits, that are implicit in such goals. These prescriptions apply to manufacturers just beginning to adopt programmable manufacturing technologies, as well as to those who are well along this path. Further in-depth research is needed if the progress being made by leading-edge users is to serve as a basis for more widespread attempts to move toward the ""factory of the future"". © 1984.",Rosenthal S.R.,Strategic,10.1016/0272-6963(84)90012-3,,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses long-term organizational plans, decisions, and the overarching direction of adopting automation technologies in manufacturing.

"The supply chain ecosystem is currently benefiting from a great dynamic resulting from the digitalization of organizations and trades. For all the stakeholders in the area, this is a real breakthrough, and machine learning is at the core of this revolution. It has profoundly revolutionized companies in many aspects including the evolution of communication methods, the automation of many processes, the growing importance of information systems, etc. With shrinking margins and more demanding customers, supply chain management in increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage. Its management and optimization requires a factual to Supply Chain decision making at strategique, tactical and operational levels. In this context and data rich environment, machine learning approaches and techniques find numerous useful applications for supply chain decision making. Today, companies have no choice but to apply Machine Learning solutions in almost every part of their processes. This fact seems even clearer in markets where competition is fierce. While Machine Learning does not redefine the enterprise, it is certainly a powerful asset for both marketing and process optimization purposes. It is so ingrained in the strategies of companies that now most of them rely heavily on it for all processes from creation, to product quality control, to public relations.

"The generation and use of customer insight in marketing decisions is poorly understood, partly due to difficulties in obtaining research access and partly becausemarket-based learning theory views knowledge as a fixed asset. However, customer insight takes many forms, arrives at the organisation from increasingly diverse sources and requires more than mere dissemination if it is to be useful. A multiple case study approach is used to explore managerial practices for insight generation and use. Multiple informants from each of four organisations in diverse sectors were interviewed.

"With the proliferation of online technologies, social media recruitment has become an essential part of any company’s outreach campaign. A social media platform can provide marketing posts with access to a large pool of candidates and at a low cost. It also provides the opportunity to quickly customize and refine messages in response to the reception. With online marketing, the key question is: which communities are attracted by recruitment tweets on social media? In this work, we profile the Twitter accounts that interact with a set of recruitment tweets by the U.S. Army’s Recruitment Command through a network-centric perspective. By harnessing how users signal their affiliations through user information, we extract and analyze communities of social identities. From Social Identity Theory, these social identities can be critical drivers of behavior, like the decision to enlist in the military. With this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of the U.S. Army’s recruitment campaign on Twitter, observing that these campaigns typically attract communities with military exposure like veterans or those that identify with professional careers and fitness (e.g., student, professionals, athletes). The campaign also attracts, but at a much lower level, interaction from those in the digital industries—data scientists, cybersecurity professionals, and so forth. When analyzing the accounts in terms of their degree of automation, we find a set of intent-unknown bot accounts interacting with the tweets, and that many of the recruitment accounts are perceived as automated accounts. These observations can aid in campaign refinement: targeting the digital community and getting a broader reach for online recruitment publicity campaigns. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

"The Indian poultry industry's success story is uniquely exceptional. From a backyard venture, it has made a quantum leap to emerge as a dynamic industry. Over the last three decades, there have been significant developments in the poultry industry with each decade focusing on different sectors. The seventies saw a spurt in egg production; the eighties an acceleration in broiler production; the nineties advances in poultry integration, automation and feed production. The present decade promises to exploit value added products and the global trade avenue. India is a developing country primarily has an agricultural economy. If agriculture blooms, the country prospers.

"Following the enforcement of the EEC Directive (1989), focused on the promotion of workers health and safety, several approaches have been developed in the last 30 years to assess the risks related to the different hazards in the work environment and to identify, based on this assessment process, measures and action to promote safety and to reduce the occupational accidents. These approaches generally are focused on the analysis of the working activity and neglect the influence of the worker characteristics involved, strongly limiting the effectiveness of the risk-based decision making. This has a particular relevance in manufacturing field, where workers are still widely employed in several tasks, despite an increasing processes automation. Within this paper an innovative approach to explicitly consider the individual characteristic of the workers within the risk assessment in the work environment is described. Integration of a Human Performance model within risk assessment process is thus proposed. The resulting method allowed the definition of a customized risk based both on the individual skill of the worker involved and on the characteristics of the work places The comparison between risk assessed with traditional method and the customized risk showed the relevant influence that the human performance may have on the risk level to which the workers are exposed to and consequently allowed the company to identify the need for technical and organisational prevention and protection measures not highlighted with the more traditional approach. This method was applied for validation to an assembly line of a heavy vehicles manufacturing plant. The impact on the risk assessment is here shown and discussed, while the results in terms of safety at the workplace are still in the phase of data collection and will be published in future work. This model represents a step into the future of safety as a precursor of a more general process of customization at the individual level that is ongoing in several branches from the precision and personalized medicine (Duarte and Spencer, 2016) to the individual financial and marketing methods (Matz and Netzer, 2017). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Comberti L.; Demichela M.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105809,Customized Risk; Human performance; Occupational safety management,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses risk assessment in occupational health and safety, particularly in manufacturing, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-automation,0,0,Customised risk assessment in manufacturing: A step towards the future of occupational safety management,2022

"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor-automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Rust R.T.; Huang M.-H.,Strategic,10.1509/jm.10.0441,Customer satisfaction; Financial impact; Marketing metrics; Self-service; Service productivity; Service quality; Technology,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the management of service productivity as a strategic decision variable aimed at maximizing profits, which aligns with long-term planning and defining organizational goals.",scopus-automation,70,10,Optimizing service productivity,2012

"For more than a decade, it has been observed that due to the continuously increasing elderly population, medical expenditures for home health-care have rapidly increased every year. Health-care organizations are being encouraged to find more efficient methods of providing high-quality care with cost savings. Elderly people who live alone may fear being unable to obtain help if they are injured or ill. For many families, the fear of such an event can dominate decisions about living arrangements. During the last decades, this fear has generated an industry, marketing house automations, alarm-and-notification systems as well as assistive technologies and interventions that aim at easier and more efficient control of their living environment, as well as the provision of specialized home-care services. In this study, the most important aspects of the INHOME platform architecture, the home-care services provided together with the home-care applications developed such as health monitoring and household appliances monitoring and control, are discussed.

"The authors discuss the long-run future of decision support systems in marketing. They argue that a growing proportion of marketing decisions can not only be supported but may also be automated. From a standpoint of both efficiency (e.g., management productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., resource allocation decisions), such automation is highly desirable. The authors describe how model-based automated decision-making is likely to penetrate various marketing decision-making environments and how such models can incorporate competitive dynamics. For example, the authors foresee that close to full automation can ultimately take place for many decisions about existing products in stable markets.

"Case (A) Birlasoft, a Global IT major, had been facing massive challenges in monitoring its sales force spread over 20 global locations. Owing to the strong client base spread all over the world and the massive sales force, the organization needed to focus on a more efficient sales tracking system. Ravi Kathuria, Senior Vice president - Global Marketing & Alliances of Birlasoft was keen to align the organization's dispersed sales force through Sales Force Automation (SFA) system. In this context, SFA was expected to provide transparency and clear visibility of the sales pipeline. There was also an expectation that SFA would help in improving efficiency of global sales force in terms of reporting and customer analysis. At first, the organization decided to implement a home grown sales force automation system, which turned out be a failure, owing to both internal and external factors. This led Kathuria to explore other options which could meet their system requirements and could be implemented in shorter time frames with minimum budget. They evaluated multiple options and are debating on which system to opt for. This case examines the various software delivery methods in the decision on new software procurement. Several software and vendor parameters and the analytical structure and process for evaluating software vendors are included for consideration. This case underlines an innovation which has introduced a complete paradigm shift in information application acquisition, that is, instead of buying software as a product, organizations are increasingly procuring it as a service.

"The paper aims to identify how Industry 4.0 technologies affect the quality and speed of the managers' decision-making process across the different stages of the value chain, based on the example of the manufacturing sector. The paper adopts qualitative research, based on nine in-depth interviews with key informants, to capture senior executives' experiences with implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in their organisations. The research is focused on three manufacturing industries: the automotive, food and furniture industries. The research shows that depending on the stage of the value chain, different Industry 4.0 technologies are more suitable for the support of managers' decisions. Various Industry 4.0 technologies support decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain. In the Design stage, 3D printing and scanning technologies play a crucial role. In the case of Inbound Logistics, robotisation, automation, Big Data analysis, and Business Intelligence are most useful. During the Manufacturing stage, robotisation, automation, 3D printing, scanning, Business Intelligence, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine (M2M) integration enable quick decision-making and speed up production. Sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) optimise distribution in the Outbound Logistics stage. And finally, Business Intelligence supports decisions within the Sales and Marketing stage. It is also the most versatile technology among all particular stages. The paper provides empirical evidence on the Industry 4.0 technology support in decision-making at different stages of the manufacturing value chain, which leads to more effective value chain management, ensuring faster and more accurate decisions at each value-chain stage. When using properly selected Industry 4.0 technologies, managers can optimise their production processes, reduce costs, avoid errors and improve customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, Industry 4.0 technologies facilitate predictive analytics to forecast and anticipate future demand, quality issues, and potential risks.

"Although it is often assumed that default rules affect change without awareness, this paper suggests that contrast with the default and transition into conscious adoption of the default design may be the starting point to establish long-term changes in consumer behavior. Despite the rooting of default rules in subconscious decision-making, this research finds that, ultimately, awareness drives the demand necessary for the creation of sustainable consumption. Whereas direct appeal to individuals has a disappointing level of influence on sustainability choices, it is understood that green consumers do come from somewhere. Green default rules offer interesting prospects for sidestepping the drawbacks of direct marketing to individuals. Under green default rules, behavior is guided by a default, such as utilities automatically sending customers renewables-sourced instead of fossil-fuel-based energy. To act otherwise requires additional effort and is less likely. Motivated by a need to understand how defaults might bridge standards and sustainable consumption, I investigate how organizational processes potentially lead from standardized green default rules to individual awareness that can spread and facilitate sustainable consumption. This paper examines the Active House sustainable building demonstrations in Europe in order to understand how (1) communications and market creation and (2) responsible, user-centered experimentation are organized to move from defaults to sustainable consumption. © 2018 by the authors.",Hale L.A.,Strategic,10.3390/su10010249,Automation; Default bias; Green default rules; Smart home; Standardization; Sustainable building; Sustainable consumption,5.0,,10,5,MDPI,"The abstract discusses long-term changes in consumer behavior, focusing on the transition from subconscious decision-making to conscious adoption of sustainable consumption practices.

"The subject of factory automation is a critical one for all business functions, with the potential of creating an entire upheaval in the fields of accounting, finance, marketing, general management, and most significantly, operations management. Totally new ways of managing a business are likely, but it is not yet clear what these ways may be. In spite of the tremendous implications of these new technologies, little research is being conducted in this area. A panel session exploring this topic was thus offered at the 1984 Toronto meeting of the American Institute for Decision Sciences. This article presents the results of that session. The intent of the article is to foster research interest in this area and identify the extensive opportunities available. The article reviews the extant literature concerning the management of factory automation and identifies the gaps in our knowledge where research is needed. Factory automation as defined here is intended to include the areas of both hard automation (CAD/CAM, robotics, FMS, etc.) and soft automation (such as MRP II, group technology, MAP, data networking). Research issues are divided into three major topic areas for ease of discussion: strategic issues, justification issues, and implementation issues. The strategic area encompasses the subjects of corporate strategy and its tie with manufacturing strategy, firm characteristics of leading-edge users of automation, the effect of learning and experience with automation, the concept of ""synergy"" among automation technologies, technology transfer, and implementation strategy. The justification issues are divided into benefit, cost, and risk aspects. The present inadequacy of economic justification techniques for automation systems and the pros and cons of alternative approaches are explored. The consideration of differing types of automation and their possible need for differing justification techniques is also discussed. For both benefits and costs, the quantification problem is a major issue, particularly with benefits believed to improve the effectiveness of operations, rather than their efficiency (a major advantage of the automation technologies, it is often claimed). Another major issue here is the pre- and postautomation comparison, requiring accurate and thorough manufacturing audit techniques. The risks in automation can be tremendous. Whether this can be reduced through incremental automation, or other approaches, is a very important question. The nature of the risks-technological, financial, sociological-is also an important subject for research, as well as methods to deal with each type. Topics in the implementation area include procedural aspects, human aspects, interface/infrastructure aspects, and measurement and reward aspects. In general, the nature of the automation implementation process, and its solution, is a critical research area that is confounded with multiple factors. There is a need for research to determine if such a thing as a ""best"" implementation path exists for specific technologies and firms. How does a firm know if it is ""ready"" for automation, and which automation technology to start with? The effect of automation on workers and management is an important research question. And in addition, what are the effects of these employees on the implementation process? And it will be necessary to know how jobs change under automation, for both line and staff. Research is also needed to determine how automation will affect the way the firm does business, how interdepartmental coordination will be affected, and whether there will even be departments. If automation is implemented piecemeal, can the pieces later be tied together? What will be the problems? Managers need to know if new measurement and reward systems will be needed for workers, or perhaps even more important, for the managers. Will incentives need to be increased, or changed in some other fashion, for managers to be willing to take the risks involved in automation? Last, some advice is given to the potential researcher in this area. Approaching this subject in a way that yields meaningful research, helpful to real managers currently struggling with these problems, is important since real firms are our primary research laboratories in this field. For example, case studies, interviews, surveys, and conceptual development are important early tools in this area compared to the traditional model building and analysis techniques that have historically characterized operations management. © 1986.",Meredith J.; Hyer N.L.; Gerwin D.; Rosenthal S.R.; Wemmerlöv U.,Strategic,10.1016/0272-6963(86)90025-2,,15.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of factory automation on various business functions, emphasizing the need for new strategic approaches and understanding the gaps in knowledge that require research.

"Purpose: Few studies have conceptualized how companies can build and nurture international dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMCs) by implementing growth hacking strategies. This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice. Hence, this study could stimulate researchers to deepen the phenomenon and empirically validate the propositions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bargoni A.; Jabeen F.; Santoro G.; Ferraris A.,Strategic,10.1108/IMR-07-2022-0156,Big data; Cognitive computing; Data-driven decision-making; Growth hacking; International dynamic marketing capabilities; International marketing,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the conceptualization of international dynamic marketing capabilities and growth hacking strategies, which are related to long-term organizational goals and adapting to international competitive environments.",scopus-automation,60,25,Growth hacking and international dynamic marketing capabilities: a conceptual framework and research propositions,2024
"Background: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the marketing of the IQOS tobacco heating system as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) in July 2020, permitting its ‘reduced exposure’ marketing. This decision is accompanied by much controversy among the global health community. We provide a preliminary analysis of Twitter conversations regarding the MRTP authorization of IQOS by identifying the authors, valence towards the policy decision, source of cited link, and focused topic. Methods: We analyzed 548 tweets mentioning MRTP posted between July 2016 (when PMI submitted the proposal) and October 2020. Results: We found a higher proportion of pro-MRTP valence (25.4%) than anti-MRTP (16.2%). Nearly half of the tweets (47.2%) expressing personal opinions presented pro-MRTP valence (vs. anti-MRTP = 23.9%). The FDA website was more frequently cited in pro-MRTP tweets (30.8% vs. anti = 4.8%), while tobacco control advocates’ websites were cited only in anti-MRTP tweets (77.4% vs. pro = 0).

"This paper focuses on the impact of digitalization and marketing automation on the “scope” of the heuristics adopted in the marketers’ decision-making processes. The “scope” refers to the decision-making contexts in which the use of the heuristic rules is diffuse and is effective. More precisely, “scope"" is (the extension of) the field in which a heuristic can be applied (successfully). The article is based on evidence collected through ethnographic interviews with twenty-three experienced marketers to discuss the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristic rules in decision-making. The marketers interviewed make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks as emerged from previous exploratory research. The paper discusses how the field of application of marketing experts' heuristics evolves as result of the digitalization and in particular of the use of automatic marketing systems. The adoption of the new automatic marketing tools modifies the task environment and the field of use of the traditional heuristic rules, but heuristics remain fundamental in the definition phase of the inputs for the automatic marketing systems, or for the interpretation of the output and therefore for the control of the marketing automation.

"This article is concerned with the relationship between time and success in the context of the procurement and implementation of administrative automation projects. It gives insight into the optimal thoroughness for user organizations to prepare themselves for the purchase of a new system. Interest in the subject stems from a contradiction found in the literature: on the one hand thorough (internal) planning and preparation of projects are recommended while on the other hand other authors state a plea for early (external) co-operation and negotiation with suppliers. Is a very thorough internal preparation a good pay-off or is it better to interact with potential suppliers after a restricted internal preparation? Results from this empirical research — which is part of a major study on marketing and purchasing of mainframe computer-systems — show that an optimum in thoroughness of internal preparation exists which is most effective regarding the quality of the project.

This paper illustrates a theoretical underpinning of the observed practice. A video rental supply chain is modelled to study pricing and replenishment decision making by the two autonomous firms in the chain, namely a movie studio producing the tapes and a video rental shop renting the tapes to customers. In the model the movie studio is to set the price for selling the tapes to the video rental store and the video rental shop must decide the number of copies of the new movie videotape it should purchase.

"Self-access language learning (SALL) can promote autonomy among language learners. It is a practical means for creating comfortable, personalized environments in which learners can take a more active part in making decisions and choices in their language learning trajectories. In the domain of second language (L2) listening, self-access work can fulfill the individual needs of learners whose listening processes are supposed to be respected. However, in countries where English is taught as a foreign language (EFL), this is not always the case due to traditional teacher-led large-sized listening classrooms and test-oriented curricula. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate Vietnamese students’ perceptions of a self-access listening platform (SALP) which was built to facilitate L2 beginners to get familiar with the fast delivery of speech and to involve their personal interpretations of the input into the comprehension process. The study also aimed to examine whether this self-access approach can cultivate autonomous listening. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews with 15 non-English major university students whose disciplines were business management, marketing, communication, and public relations. They completed a six-week listening course on this online listening platform. The major findings indicate that students had positive listening experiences with the SALP regarding time flexibility and practicality. Despite students’ full awareness of the potential benefits of the SALP, a few of them still showed resistance to the self-access listening approach as a substitution for traditional classroom-based listening. The results reported here shed new light on the possibilities of implementing autonomy-based listening in a virtual self-access environment in L2 listening pedagogy. © 2023 Author(s).",Thi Mai V.L.,Not identified,10.37237/140303,learner autonomy; learners’ perceptions; self-access language learning; self-access listening; Vietnamese EFL learners,100.0,,0,0,Kanda University of International Studies,"The abstract discusses self-access language learning and perceptions of a listening platform within educational contexts, which does not align with the definitions provided for strategic, tactical, or operational classifications related to marketing.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,Autonomy-Based Listening: Vietnamese University Students’ Perceptions of Self-Access Web-Based Listening Practices,2023
"Automated negotiation by autonomous agents has become increasingly important since the advent of e-marketplace. In this study, automated negotiation is viewed as a search process in which negotiators jointly search for a mutually acceptable contract in a multidimensional space formed by negotiable issues. This search is formulated as a multiple-objective decision making problem and is solved through an iterative process of generating offers by fuzzy inference systems. These fuzzy inference systems serve as a search heuristic and are formulated based on the strategy of issue trade-offs.

"Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer science. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Zhang H.; Vorobeychik Y.,Not identified,10.1007/s10462-017-9577-z,Agent-based modeling; Calibration; Empirical method; Innovation diffusion; Literature review; Validation,80.0,,5,0,Springer Netherlands,"The abstract discusses agent-based modeling and innovation diffusion but does not clearly align with marketing-related strategic, tactical, or operational decisions.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to craft a future research agenda to advance smart service research and practice. Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on discussions in the workshop on “Fresh perspectives on technology in service” at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings – We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value – Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored.

"Technological advancements in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), particularly the integration of diverse stakeholder groups (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, repairers, CAV consumers, and the general public) and the pursuit of new economic opportunities, have resulted in the emergence of new technical, legal, and social challenges. The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency. Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard. © 2023 The Authors",Khalid Khan S.; Shiwakoti N.; Stasinopoulos P.; Warren M.,Strategic,10.1016/j.aap.2023.107054,Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical system; Driverless cars; Governance; Laws,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the development of a dynamic modelling tool for analyzing cybersecurity regulations in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), focusing on long-term implications and stakeholder integration, which aligns closely with strategic planning.",scopus-autonomous,70,15,Modelling cybersecurity regulations for automated vehicles,2023
"Digital technologies are revolutionizing agricultural trade, enabling farm input suppliers to reach customers through multiple channels. The aim of this study was to segment farmers based on their purchasing behavior for crop protection products and to examine segment-specific characteristics in the digital environment. A cluster analysis of 590 German farm managers was used to identify five distinctive buyer segments based on five characteristics: dealer, brand and service orientation, price affinity and autonomous decision making. The results demonstrate that farmers place high value on personal contacts to stationary suppliers when purchasing crop protection products. Service orientation turned out to be a strong mediator of segment membership, while price and product brand are secondary to farmer segmentation. However, traditional typologies are only suitable for the digitization topic to a limited extent, as digital search and information behavior hardly differs. Even though digital information procurement is becoming increasingly interesting for all segments, an openness to e-commerce applies only to a small group of independent buyers. Concerning e-commerce attitudes, the perception of its advantages and the lack of personal contact differentiates the clusters the most. The results contribute to the scientific understanding of farmers’ information and purchasing behavior and provide initial approaches for the development of customer-centric corporate marketing strategies. © 2022 Schulze Schwering et al.",Schweringi D.S.; Hollenbeck A.; Krone S.; Spiller A.; Lemken D.,Tactical,10.22434/IFAMR2021.0095,Agri-chemical; Cluster analysis; Farm inputs; Omni-channel; Purchasing behavior,5.0,,5,0,Wageningen Academic Publishers,"The study focuses on segmenting farmers based on their purchasing behavior and examines specific characteristics for targeted marketing strategies.

"Automated calibration methods are a common approach to agent-based model calibration as they can estimate those parameters which cannot be set because of the lack of information. The modeler requires to validate the model by checking the parameter values before the model can be used and this task is very challenging when the model considers two or more conflicting outputs. We propose a multicriteria integral framework to assist the modeler in the calibration and validation of agent-based models that combines evolutionary multiobjective optimization with network-based visualization, which we believe is the first integral approach to model calibration. On the one hand, evolutionary multiobjective optimization provides several sets of calibration solutions (i.e., parameter values) with different trade-offs for the considered objectives in a single run. On the other hand, network-based visualization is used to better understand the decision space and the set of solutions from the obtained Pareto set approximation. To illustrate our proposal, we face the calibration of three agent-based model examples for marketing which consider two conflicting criteria: the awareness of the brand and its word-of-mouth volume. The final analysis of the calibrated solutions shows how our proposed framework eases the analysis of Pareto sets with high cardinality and helps with the identification of flexible solutions (i.e., those having close values in the design space). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Moya I.; Chica M.; Cordón Ó.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2019.113111,Agent-based modeling; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Information visualization; Model calibration,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a multicriteria integral framework for calibrating agent-based models specifically for marketing applications.

"Brand coolness is a relatively understudied but important marketing phenomenon that only recently has received systematic scrutiny. We investigate a multidimensional structure of brand coolness and show how it mediates the effects of product quality on word of mouth communication and on intentions to buy/use cool brands. We also demonstrate under what conditions brand coolness influences WOM and intentions. The self-concept, rooted in materialism and expressed as the desire to impress other people and to compare oneself to others so as to emulate them, serves to regulate the effects of brand coolness in a negative way on WOM and intentions, thereby fulfilling the autonomous function of brand coolness for consumers described in the past as one important aspect of brand coolness. In order to show the incremental contribution of brand coolness in predicting WOM and decisions to buy/use cool brands, the effects of brand coolness are tested in head-to-head comparisons with the influence of self-brand connections and attitudes toward cool brands, which are classically studied brand drivers, on a representative sample of 400 adult Americans aged 20–40 years inclusive. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bagozzi R.P.; Khoshnevis M.,Tactical,10.1080/10696679.2022.2081925,,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the mediating effects of brand coolness on word of mouth communication and purchase intentions, which relates to structured decision-making processes in marketing strategies.

"Reputation is critical for building relationships with business customers in the global marketplace. However, in structurally connected organization configurations, the literature focuses mainly on one of the functional unit's reputations (either subordinate or superordinate organization), leaving out the interplay of reputation among various units in the organization. Drawing on identity and categorization theories, we develop a framework to examine the effects of brand reputation at both levels. Our study context is higher education, where business schools (subordinate) operate as autonomous entities globally yet are dependent on universities (superordinate) for policy decisions. We specify a random effects model on a 10-year panel dataset of 193 business schools to account for unobserved heterogeneity, potential selection bias, and endogeneity of reputation. Our findings suggest that brand reputation attributes at the subordinate and superordinate levels both individually and synergistically affect subordinate funding outcomes (i.e., business-school endowment). Furthermore, subordinate-level resource-utilization signals, such as diversification strategies and top executives' backgrounds, and superordinate-level policy signals, such as organization ownership and inclusivity, inform donor decisions and moderate the reputation–funding relationship. Our study suggests that administrators and managers should consider donor identity salience in marketing efforts. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Anand A.; Kumar V.; Lahiri A.,Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.11.009,Brand identity salience; Categorization theory; Higher education; Information signals; Organizational reputation,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the interplay of reputation among different organizational levels, specifically in the context of higher education, which aligns with long-term strategic goals and the overall nature of organizational identity and funding outcomes.",scopus-autonomous,70,15,Categorization of organizational reputation and subordinate organizations' global funding outcome: A higher education perspective,2024
"High-level autonomous vehicles (AVs) are likely to improve the quality of children's travel to and from school (such as improve travel safety and increase travel mobility). These expected benefits will not be presented if parents are not willing to use AVs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore parents’ intentions of using AVs to transport children to and from school (parents’ intentions). This study has two primary aims: 1) Exploring parents’ intentions and their potential determinants. 2) Making recommendations for manufacturers to develop and market AVs suitable for school travel based on the research results. Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents’ intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents’ intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents’ intentions.

"Purpose: The selection of purchasing channels by wine consumers indirectly affects buying experience and satisfaction, therefore, it is of great practical significance to study consumers' preference on channel selection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of consumer selection for purchasing channel and the corresponding influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,976 valid questionnaires were collected by convenience sampling from 34 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China in 2020 via the Internet, yielding a response rate of 82.2%. A categorical statistical approach was used to understand consumer's selection for each channel. Besides, binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors affecting consumers' channel selection. Findings: The results show that Chinese wine consumers' main purchasing channels are as follows: supermarket/mall, wine specialty stores, comprehensive e-business flagship stores, comprehensive e-business individual stores, restaurants and short video and live streaming platforms. Estimation results showed that among the 12 influencing factors in 4 categories, consumers' education and some other factors significantly influenced consumers' decision on wine purchasing channels.

"The imagery of any foodstuff is shaped by assumptions of what is culturally valued as food, assumptions that are also fed by marketing, expert nutritional advice and intermittent food ""alarms"". This paper raises the issue of risk communication versus advertising and argues that in order to better understand consumers' response to food risk communication we should pay closer attention to the broader information environment in which the compromised foodstuffs are embedded. Any new information properly crafted in the form of ""risk messages"" necessarily interacts with the information that constitutes the foodstuff's environment. It is proposed that focusing on such an environment, rather than on the ""content"" of the risk message alone, improves understanding of how the risk message eventually triggers further selections and decisions about the compromised foodstuff.

"Sustainable ecosystem services consumption is of vital importance to the survival and development of human society. How to balance the conflicts between ecosystem protection and ecosystem services consumption by local residents has been a serious challenge, especially in ecologically vulnerable areas. To explore the reasonable ecosystem services consumption approaches of grassland ecosystems for sustainable land system management, this study takes Hulun Buir of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a case study region and develops an EcoC-G (ecological consumption of grassland) model based on herders' livelihood behaviors using the agent-based model technique to simulate the dynamics of ecosystem pressure, livestock production, and living quality of herders under different grassland management scenarios over the next 30 years. The EcoC-G model links the supply and consumption of grassland ecosystem services by calculating the ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) supply and household NPP consumption. The model includes three sub-models, namely, the individual status transferring sub-model, the households' grassland-use decision sub-model, and the ecosystem pressure sub-model. In accordance with multi-objective grassland management practices, the following four land management scenarios were simulated: (1) baseline scenario, (2) increasing household's living standard, (3) ecosystem protection, and (4) balancing living standard improvement with the protection of the ecosystem. The result indicates that by focusing on the NPP supply and consumption of the grassland ecosystem, the EcoC-G is capable of simulating the impacts of herders' livelihood behaviors on grassland ecosystems. If timely grassland management strategies are implemented, it is possible to relieve the ecosystem pressure and improve the livelihood of local herders. The specific scenario simulation results are: (1) Under the current grassland management mode, the pasture could never be overgrazed, and herders could achieve the basic living standard, but the accumulated wealth decreased due to the decline of livestock. (2) With grazing control, herders can accumulate wealth by increasing the breeding amount and reducing the marketing rate, but the ecosystem consumption pressure can reach a maximum of 2.3 times. (3) With strict restrictions on the livestock number, the pressure on the ecosystem decreases; however, herders might not achieve basic living standards. (4) Modest regulation leads to rational ecological consumption intervals, meaning the ecosystem pressure will become stable and herders can gradually accumulate wealth with the achievement of basic living standards in advance. © 2019 by the authors.",Yan H.; Pan L.; Xue Z.; Zhen L.; Bai X.; Hu Y.; Huang H.-Q.,Not identified,10.3390/su11082261,Agent-based modeling (ABM); Ecosystem pressure; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem services consumption; Net primary productivity,70.0,,0,30,MDPI,"The abstract discusses ecosystem services consumption and management strategies without clearly aligning with any of the defined categories (Strategic, Tactical, or Operational) related to marketing or organizational decision-making.

"Broad genome-wide testing is increasingly finding its way to the public through the online direct-to-consumer marketing of so-called personal genome tests. Personal genome tests estimate genetic susceptibilities to multiple diseases and other phenotypic traits simultaneously. Providers commonly make use of Terms of Service agreements rather than informed consent procedures. However, to protect consumers from the potential physical, psychological and social harms associated with personal genome testing and to promote autonomous decision-making with regard to the testing offer, we argue that current practices of information provision are insufficient and that there is a place - and a need - for informed consent in personal genome testing, also when it is offered commercially. The increasing quantity, complexity and diversity of most testing offers, however, pose challenges for information provision and informed consent. Both specific and generic models for informed consent fail to meet its moral aims when applied to personal genome testing. Consumers should be enabled to know the limitations, risks and implications of personal genome testing and should be given control over the genetic information they do or do not wish to obtain. We present the outline of a new model for informed consent which can meet both the norm of providing sufficient information and the norm of providing understandable information. The model can be used for personal genome testing, but will also be applicable to other, future forms of broad genetic testing or screening in commercial and clinical settings. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bunnik E.M.; Janssens A.C.J.W.; Schermer M.H.N.,Out of scope,10.1111/bioe.12004,Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer; Generic consent; Genetic testing; Informed consent; Personal genome testing; Specific consent,,0.0,0,100,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,"The abstract discusses personal genome testing and informed consent in a healthcare context, which does not relate to marketing.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,Informed consent in direct-to-consumer personal genome testing: The outline of a model between specific and generic consent,2014
"Many contemporary markets, particularly markets of information technology products and information services, are characterized by increasing returns, including those resulting from bandwagon and network effects. At the same time, in larger firms, innovation often takes place in distinct units that are semi-autonomous and that have the responsibility for more than one phase in the product development process. In the most extreme case, a separate profit center is created within which research and development (R&D), production, marketing, and related activities are fully integrated and that has its own responsibility for external relations: an internal innovative venture. The central issue in this paper is the relation between the way firms organize their innovative activities and the market dynamics caused by bandwagon and network effects. We focus on the decision-making actors and we propose a categorization of causes of increasing returns and definitions of bandwagon and network effects that are consistent with this aim. We investigate the extent of internal autonomy of the unit, the extent of the integration of R&D, marketing and other activities in the product development process, and the extent of external autonomy. Three cases of projects creating software products, two of them in the same firm, demonstrate that the organization of innovation and the dynamics of the market are mutually dependent. More in particular, we hold that higher autonomy of teams, particularly in managing external relations, is important to cope with and manage bandwagon and network effects.",Van Den Ende J.; Wijnberg N.,Strategic,10.1109/TEM.2003.817286,Autonomy of project teams; Bandwagon effects; Increasing returns; Network effects; Organization of innovation,5.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses the organization of innovative activities within firms and their relationship with market dynamics, focusing on long-term implications and decision-making actors, which aligns with strategic considerations.",scopus-autonomous,60,20,The organization of innovation and market dynamics: Managing increasing returns in software firms,2003
"This paper models autonomous ridesharing — multiple travelers simultaneously riding one shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) — in a network equilibrium setting with mixed SAV and human-driven vehicle (HV) traffic. We make two major methodological contributions. First, a novel one (SAV)-to-many (riders) matching is proposed to characterize the waiting times of an SAV and multiple travelers who share rides in the SAV during online matching, which is a nontrivial generalization of the one-to-one matching without ridesharing. Our matching characterization considers the possibilities of a traveler matched with an SAV starting from the same origin, whereto the SAV moved unoccupied as a result of either pickup or relocation, or with an in-service SAV that goes through the traveler's origin. Second, a section-based formulation for SAV ridesharing user equilibrium is introduced to characterize the SAV traveler flow, which accommodates the possibility that an SAV traveler's itinerary (OD pair) is different from that of the serving SAV and other travelers in the SAV. Unlike the existing link and route based ridesharing formulations, the notion of section both prevents undesired traveler en-route transfer(s) and allows travelers of multiple ODs to share rides, meanwhile respecting the SAV seat capacity constraint. In addition to the above two methodological contributions, the optimal SAV fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation (to in-service, pickup, and relocation states) decisions of a transportation network company (TNC) are formulated. The TNC decisions anticipate traveler reactions as characterized by a new multimodal autonomous ridesharing user equilibrium (MARUE), which is put forward with a proof of its existence and finds the endogenous market shares and road congestion effects of SAV/HV. Original insights are obtained from model implementation, including substantial systemwide benefit of ridesharing, marginal benefit of relocation in the presence of ridesharing, and diminishing economies of SAV size. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Noruzoliaee M.; Zou B.,Strategic,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.002,Endogenous market share; Network congestion; One-to-many matching; Section-based ridesharing equilibrium; Shared autonomous vehicle,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract focuses on modeling autonomous ridesharing and includes long-term implications for fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation decisions, which are strategic in nature.

"In the paper, a descriptive model of system dynamics for binary data is presented. Binary or dichotomous data are widely spread across various fields of research - in decision making and data mining, marketing, solving of many natural, social and technical problems. The initial data for building the model is a set of states of an autonomous dynamical system with components taking binary values. At the same time, the time order of the states is permissible. The following objectives were stated: to identify the relationships between the components of the system defining its dynamics; on the basis of the identified dynamics, to recover the true order of the system states; to apply the developed model to the problem of visual identification of cyanobacteria in water areas using digital photography. To solve the problem, we used a mathematical model that enables to describe the relationships between components and transitions between the system states at a simple-forunderstanding level. The principle of parsimony underlies the model. According to this principle, the most appropriate model is described by the simplest relations in the sense defined in the work. As the case study, the problem of recognizing clumps of cyanobacteria from digital satellite imagery was considered. This is a complex, practically important problem that does not have a satisfactory experimental and theoretical solution at the moment. Applying system approaches to the measured colorimetric parameters of digital photography, we developed the index for identification of such clumps. This index uses the parameters of the digital RGB model of (various parts of) an image and allows us to reveal clumps of cyanobacteria on digital images obtained by aerospace methods. Additionally, digital photography can be performed in the conditions of insufficient visibility (due to precipitation, fog, and other factors), for imitation of which in the case study the original image was distorted by the digital noise. The studied model can find useful applications in the areas requiring binary dynamical data insights. © K. Nosov, G. Zholtkevych, M. Georgiyants, O. Vysotska, Y. Balym, A.

"The advent of new genetic and genomic technologies may cause friction with the principle of respect for autonomy and demands a rethinking of traditional interpretations of the concept of informed consent. Technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and micro-array based analysis enable genome-wide testing for many heterogeneous abnormalities and predispositions simultaneously. This may challenge the feasibility of providing adequate pre-test information and achieving autonomous decision-making. At a symposium held at the 11th World Congress of Bioethics in June 2012 (Rotterdam), organized by the International Association of Bioethics, these challenges were presented for three different areas in which these so-called 'new genetics' technologies are increasingly being applied: newborn screening, prenatal screening strategies and commercial personal genome testing. In this article, we build upon the existing ethical framework for a responsible set-up of testing and screening offers and reinterpret some of its criteria in the light of the new genetics. As we will argue, the scope of a responsible testing or screening offer should align with the purpose(s) of testing and with the principle of respect for autonomy for all stakeholders involved, including (future) children. Informed consent is a prerequisite but requires a new approach. We present preliminary and general directions for an individualized or differentiated set-up of the testing offer and for the informed consent process. With this article we wish to contribute to the formation of new ideas on how to tackle the issues of autonomy and informed consent for (public) healthcare and direct-to-consumer applications of the new genetics. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bunnik E.M.; de Jong A.; Nijsingh N.; de Wert G.M.W.R.,Out of scope,10.1111/bioe.12030,Autonomy; Direct-to-consumer genetic testing; Informed consent; Neonatal screening; New genetics; Personal genome testing; Prenatal screening,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses ethical implications of genetic technologies and informed consent in healthcare, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,The new genetics and informed consent: Differentiating choice to preserve autonomy,2013
"Purpose: User acceptance is a necessary precondition to implementing self-driving buses as a solution to public transport challenges. Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications: This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value: While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment. © 2024, Myriam Quinones, Jaime Romero, Anne Schmitz and Ana M.

"Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research has focused on public acceptance of and intention to use AVs, with trust emerging as important to these variables. Research on AV trust has centered on trust in vehicle performance. However, trust evaluation may include AV manufacturers and developers, and regulation pertaining to AVs; thus, we expand our measurement of trust to include beliefs based on manufacturers and regulation. In this experiment, we manipulate information regarding manufacturer focus (i.e., an emphasis on standards, regulations, and research (SRR) versus speed to market) to determine its effect on trust. When information focused on SRR, we found higher levels of trust in AV performance and in manufacturers, compared to when it focused on speed to market. In addition, information regarding passenger control (i.e., the ability to take over for the vehicle and to determine privacy settings) was manipulated to yield either high or low passenger control conditions. Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AVs was lowest when speed to market was emphasized and when passenger control was low. Furthermore, trust was tested as a mediator between perceived risk and BI. Trust in AV performance partially mediated the relationship between perceived AV performance risk and BI. In addition, trust in AV regulation partially mediated the relationship between AV privacy/security risk and BI. Researchers should continue to examine trust beyond the AV itself to encompass trust in manufacturers and regulations. Those designing and marketing AVs should carefully consider decisions that influence manufacturer/developer reputation and passenger control due to their effect on intention to use AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Waung M.; McAuslan P.; Lakshmanan S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.004,Autonomous vehicles; Mental models; Passenger control; Perceived risk; Trust,5.0,,20,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses specific manipulations of information regarding AV manufacturers and passenger control and their effects on trust and behavioral intention to use AVs.

"Introduction Co-operative societies have not been untouched by the social and technological phenomenon that has exploded online throughout the beginning of the century, which has connected millions of people and has had an undeniable impact on society. We are, of course, talking about online social networks. Specifically, we focus on the organic products sector, which is also becoming of increasing importance to society, as reflected by the continuous development of the market and that of olive oil, in which Spain holds a position of some importance globally. Objectives Thus, the aim of this study is to focus on the analysis of the use of and penetration of these online tools within the organic olive business community, with special focus on the entities in the Social Economy, the vast majority of which are co-operative societies. Design The population studied consists of organic entities that are processors and marketers of olive oil in Andalusia, registered in the Sistema de Informacion de la Produccion Ecologica de la Junta de Andalucia (The Autonomous Government of Andalusia Organic Production Information System, SIPEA). A structured telephone survey was carried out on this population, specifically aimed at the management of these 'organic olive oil processing and marketing' entities, where information on the use and commitment of the organisation was collected by the ICTs. Also, a checkpoint was created containing key account metrics of the organisations with accounts in the online social networks Facebook and Twitter. Other detailed statistics are also included in this checkpoint, obtained from analysing these accounts with on-line tools specialised in online social networks such as LikeAlyzer and Twitonomy. Methodology To determine the impact and penetration of the ICT, descriptive statistics were utilised, and then, a more comprehensive analysis of online social networks was conducted using the DEA method (Data Envelopment Analysis). DEA methodology, both nonparametric and deterministic, aims to measure the efficiency of a set of homogeneous decision-making units (DMU) using linear programming to compare identical inputs and outputs, to obtain a ranking efficiency (Samoilenko, 2014). Specifically, the variables that determine the efficiency levels considered as inputs and outputs of the model are the main metrics obtained on the use and success of the organisations in online social networks. In this way, the main activity indicators that reveal the use and development of these tools by the organisations have been used as inputs. The main monitoring indicators, which reflect the popularity of these accounts in online social networks serve as the outputs. The high level of sensitivity of the DEA method to outliers makes this one of the main weaknesses of the method (Wilson, 1995). To solve this problem we have used the super-efficiency method, detecting and removing observations contaminated by noise, which produces more accurate results and a more accurate classification efficiency (Banker and Chang, 2006). Results In a first analysis of the use of ICT by organic olive organisations, it is observed that the existing differences between the two types of organisations, SCA and SAT as compared with other legal forms, are not relevant regarding the presence of a website or the use of e-commerce. In relation to the use of virtual social networks, 53.74 percent of organisational leaders confirm they make regular use of these platforms. Discriminating between entities of the social economy and other legal forms shows us that 37.50 percent of co-operative societies and SAT report using these platforms. This is in comparison to 61.62 percent of other legal forms, representing a more than 24 percentage point difference between the two groups. On the other hand, although capitalist entities make greater use of virtual social networks, on average, they are less efficient in their usage of such platforms, compared with organisations in the Social Economy. Thus, the results obtained after using the DEA method show us that, considering the variable returns to scale (BCC model), 76.92 percent of co-operative societies and SAT are more efficient in online social networks, compared to 23.08 percent of the remaining legal forms. This increased efficiency is also maintained in the CCR model. Therefore, and in line with other investigations, this confirms that co-operative societies and online SATs use online social networks in a way that is more geared towards transactional rather than relational purposes (Lopez et al., 2012; Montegut et al., 2013; Munoz and Tirado, 2014), although their social nature is advantageous for them on platforms such as online social networks. Conclusions The differences between entities belonging to the Social Economy and other legal forms with respect to the use of websites or online stores are not significant. However, it is confirmed that the organic olive co-operative entities and their SAT counterparts clearly lag in the use of online social networks. In general, these platforms are largely undervalued by the business community in this entire sector. The inflexibility of co-operative societies in adapting to the changing environment and, in particular, to technological changes (COGECA, 2010), is considered a clear explanatory factor in these results. This is due to increasing awareness of its importance as the business use of online social networks is a relatively recent phenomenon. According to Bridges et al. (2010), greater market orientation and integration of co-operative societies is necessary, which will stimulate the commitment to online social networks. Furthermore, the results show that the SCA and SAT are entities that are more efficient in their use of these online platforms. We believe the main supporting factor for this is the aforementioned confluence of values between the Social Economy and Web 2.0. The relevance of communication within co-operative societies (Herranz, 2007) has made the Internet an indispensable yet still underrated tool. In this sense, the singular operational methods and characteristics of these entities (Mozas et al., 2015), makes the use of online social networks, an economic, simple and affordable media, which could be extremely useful for them. Therefore, the social identity that co-operative societies present and transmit gives them an advantage in online media, which results in an extremely efficient method of achieving greater popularity with a lesser degree of effort. As the main limitation of the study addressed the sectoral nature of the investigation, this makes it difficult to generalise about all entities in the Social Economy. However, given the scarcity of related studies, this research is a clear starting point for extending the analysis to other industries and institutions such as co-operative societies of second degree and above.

"In the 21st century, facing with increasingly severe resource shortages and environmental pollution problems, the public has begun to change consumption concept and support green consumption actions initiated by the government and companies. Since the trade-in subsidy policy provided by government was canceled, companies have implemented trade-in on their own. As a method of competition, marketing strategy research pays more and more attention to trade-in, which shows many advantages such as benefiting the people, stimulating consumption and upgrading products. Currently, the studies of trade-in mainly focus on discussing the superiority when it is carried out by a single enterprise. The current study seldom analyzes trade-in systematically from supply chain perspective when it is implemented by different investors. In addition, whether an old customer buys a new product depends on the previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products. Existing studies have not considered the purchase decision characteristics of old customers. In this paper, the market is divided into two parts. One market is the new customer, and the other one is the old customer. The previous usage experience and the depreciation of old products are considered as two important factors when an old customer purchases a new product. This paper is based on the two-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer and a manufacturer. Trade-in policy implemented by retailer and manufacturer is constructed by considering customer utility to study strategic optimization of supply chain system. Firstly, decision-makings of supply chains of three strategic models are compared and analyzed to study their impact on customers. Secondly, the optimal path of supply chain strategy is provided and discussed from the perspective of business efficiency. Thirdly, the impact of market factors on supply chain efficiency of the optimal path adopted in the supply chain is discussed. Finally, by comparing consumer surpluses and social welfares of the three strategies, the social advantages of the adopted optimal path are studied. This study has four major research findings. First, trade-in strategy has a significant impact on product sales and corporate profits. The manufacturer or retailer can strive for greater profit by investing trade-in on his own initiative than before. That will be an obstacle to implementing trade-in strategy. Therefore, when making decisions the manufacturer should properly pay regard to the retailer, and then select a reasonable strategy according to the relationship between them, such as investing trade-in cooperatively. Second, whichever trade-in strategy is adopted in the market, external market (namely retail price, buy-back price, market demand and customer net utility remain stable. However, internal system (namely wholesale price) is obviously dependent on the investor. Third, trade-in strategy is difficult to benefit all parties under market segments. When it is beneficial to one side, it is bound to harm the other side. When the repurchase desire of old customer for a new product is small, the trade-in strategy can effectively strengthen the product stickiness of old customer; however, it can weaken the product's appeal to potential new customer. Fourth, in some cases trade-in strategy will reduce overall consumer surplus and total social welfare. Only when the old customer’s market share, the previous usage experience or the depreciation of old product is higher than a certain threshold, it can benefit all consumers and the society © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",Hong-Yuan L.; Bo Y.; Yan-Ping L.,Strategic,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2019.01.016,Consumer utility; Social welfare; Strategy optimization; Supply chain; Trade-In,5.0,,10,5,Zhejiang University,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of trade-in strategies within a supply chain context, focusing on optimizing business efficiency and the impact on customer behavior, aligning with strategic planning that defines organizational goals.",scopus-autonomous,60,20,Strategy optimization of autonomous trade-in in the supply chain with considering consumer utility; [考虑消费者效用的供应链自主以旧换新策略优化],2019
"This Point/Counterpoint article discusses the transformation of dental practice from the traditional solo/small-group (partnership) model of the 1900s to large Dental Support Organizations (DSO) that support affiliated dental practices by providing nonclinical functions such as, but not limited to, accounting, human resources, marketing, and legal and practice management. Many feel that DSO-managed group practices (DMGPs) with employed providers will become the setting in which the majority of oral health care will be delivered in the future. Viewpoint 1 asserts that the traditional dental practice patterns of the past are shifting as many younger dentists gravitate toward employed positions in large group practices or the public sector. Although educational debt is relevant in predicting graduates’ practice choices, other variables such as gender, race, and work-life balance play critical roles as well. Societal characteristics demonstrated by aging Gen Xers and those in the Millennial generation blend seamlessly with the opportunities DMGPs offer their employees. Viewpoint 2 contends the traditional model of dental care delivery—allowing entrepreneurial practitioners to make decisions in an autonomous setting—is changing but not to the degree nor as rapidly as Viewpoint 1 professes. Millennials entering the dental profession, with characteristics universally attributed to their generation, see value in the independence and flexibility that a traditional practice allows. Although DMGPs provide dentists one option for practice, several alternative delivery models offer current dentists and future dental school graduates many of the advantages of DMGPs while allowing them to maintain the independence and freedom a traditional practice provides. © American Dental Education Association","Cole J.R.; Dodge W.W.; Findley J.S.; Young S.K.; Horn B.D.; Kalkwarf K.L.; Martin M.M., Jr.; Winder R.L.",Out of scope,10.1002/j.0022-0337.2015.79.5.tb05905.x,dental group practice; dentists; ownership; practice management; private practice; professional autonomy; professional practice location,,0.0,0,100,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,"The abstract discusses changes in dental practice models and the implications for the profession, which are not related to marketing strategies or decisions.",scopus-autonomous,0,0,Will Large DSO-Managed Group Practices Be the Predominant Setting for Oral Health Care by 2025?

"Multiple channel retailing and channel selection strategy have become key issues for many corporations to place themselves at the heart of a new era of retailing. This paper studies a triple-channel system in which a manufacturer operates a conventional channel, a direct online channel, as well as increases its online presence with an online shopping platform. It also takes the heterogeneity of consumers’ price sensitivity and channel preferences into account. It highlights that the perceived risks and perceived benefits are aggregated into an inhibitor or activator entering the customers’ acceptance of triple channels and further affecting their purchasing decisions. Three cases are discussed to investigate the demand distributions, the profit behaviours, the optimal pricing strategies and the channel selection strategies. Theoretical analysis is further validated by a case study with the aid of agent-based modelling. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that two acceptance indices – respectively, regarded as the consumers’ willingness to tolerate the perceived risks of the online channel and approve the perceived benefits from the third-party online platform – significantly govern the total profit in two stylised scenarios. This study schematically characterises the structure of demand distributions, helps the corporation to discern consumers’ channel choices and then focus its marketing efforts towards more profitable customers and strategic channel structures. Furthermore, some implications are outlined for the optimal supply chain designation decision. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Zhang W.-G.; Zhang Q.; Mizgier K.J.; Zhang Y.,Strategic,10.1080/00207543.2017.1336679,Agent-based simulation; Heterogeneous valuation; Multi-channel retailing; Perceived risk; Supply chain design,5.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a triple-channel retailing system and highlights the importance of understanding consumer behavior, pricing strategies, and channel selection, which are all aligned with long-term strategic planning for a corporation.",scopus-autonomous,60,25,Integrating the customers’ perceived risks and benefits into the triple-channel retailing,2017
"Destination management is an important competitive marketing method for global tourism destinations. Especially, when cooperated with image and brand management, it helps destinations to stand out from today's severe crowd of competition. The successful and efficient destination management companies usually play a major role in marketing their destinations, but there exists a conflict in literature on the level of involvement in related marketing activities. Though managing an autonomous organization having its' own budget and freedom in decision making seems to be the best solution to meet the rapidly changing trends and needs of global tourists, it needs to be analyzed within the organizations' managerial level. The aim of this article is to determine the perspectives of DMO managers from the most important two destinations in Turkey, which is a very popular country that is usually in the first 10 in the international tourism market.

"Although a small body of research has examined the motivational foundations of homeowners' decisions to adopt rooftop solar panels, in this research we compared adoptive and non-adoptive homeowners in the United States (N = 824) across a spectrum of values and motives to identify the most salient predictors of solar adoption within various demographic and political strata. Results of hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that autonomous (i.e., internal) pro-environmental motivation linked to solar adoption regardless of age, income, and education. In contrast, the effects of altruism and controlled (i.e., image and status based) environmental motivation depended on demographic characteristics. That is, altruism was positively associated with adoption for older homeowners, but negatively linked to adoption for younger homeowners. Additionally, controlled motivation predicted solar adoption for both younger and higher income homeowners, but it was not a predictor for older and lower income homeowners. We highlight the importance of assessing interactions between demographics, on one hand, and motives and values, on the other, in order to reveal nuances in the motivations of different types of adopters. These findings underscore the need for more targeted solar policy, marketing, and public messaging. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Legault L.; Bird S.; Heintzelman M.D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.erss.2024.103481,Demographics; Environmental motivation; Solar panel adoption; Values,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research identifies specific predictors of solar adoption among different demographic and political strata, which can be translated into targeted marketing strategies and public messaging for solar adoption.

"The data used in the opinion can be either factual or subjective, or both. The subjective form includes a positive or negative view, whereas there are facts in the objective form. As the result of opinion mining, the subjectivity and objectivity of knowledge are described as created. The outcome may be either positive or negative or a combination of both. Machine learning helps the computer to behave without a specific task being specifically programmed. Many consumers will critically evaluate everything online, especially food and amenities in eateries, to show their modest viewpoint. These views are critical in the decision-making process, especially in an uncertain feedback pool. Manually evaluating and deriving genuine opinions from these evaluations is very tough despite the growing count of opinions that are accessible in every category. So, to solve this issue, an automated methodology is needed. Sentiment evaluations or opinion extraction are returned methodologies to evaluate and identify uncertain feedback subjects as either positive or negative in these reviews. Three different dimensions of recommender systems are present; document-based, sentence-based, and aspect-based. Report and statement-based opinion mining concentrates on the broader orientation of the review and does not identify more accurately the crucial aspects of all the extracted reviews. The subject of trend is thus view-based opinion mining, and the emphasis of this research is on the restaurant's feedback sector. Creative marketing strategies are planned using sentiment assessments and opinion mining. The sentiment classifications are managed through a smart method called Neuro-Fuzzy Sentiment Classification. It is an entirely automated method of sentiment estimation and prediction. It can be used to group textual data and then used to identify patterns about the contents of the textual information. The resultant data aids in creating autonomous systems that consider the input from customers and prepare restaurant strategies. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",Kumar V.V.; Raghunath K.M.K.; Muthukumaran V.; Joseph R.B.; Beschi I.S.; Uday A.K.,Tactical,10.1007/s13198-021-01379-2,Accuracy; Aspect-based; Classification; Document-based; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentenced-based; Sentiment analysis; Uncertain feedback pool,5.0,,20,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses methodologies for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, which are tactical approaches to understanding consumer feedback and improving marketing strategies in the restaurant sector.",scopus-autonomous,15,60,Aspect based sentiment analysis and smart classification in uncertain feedback pool,2022
"Research that explores Muslim women's hospitality and tourism decision-making is limited. This paper attempts to bring a new perspective to the literature on social media and consumption decisions in the hospitality and tourism sector by focusing on Muslim women as a consumer segment. Based on a survey of 791 Muslim women in the UK, it finds that autonomous self-expression, self-disclosure, and reciprocity to self-disclosure on Facebook were positively related to bonding and bridging social capital, which in turn related positively to their empowerment in hospitality and tourism decision-making. Employment status moderated some of these relations. The paper breaks new ground by bringing together two disparate research strands in the tourism literature: one that focuses on women but ignores religion, and the other that studies Islamic tourism but overlooks the role of women. The findings offer insights into hospitality and tourism marketing strategies aimed at Muslim women. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Khan I.M.; Sahadev S.; Rashid T.; Banerjee S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijhm.2021.103125,Empowerment; Facebook; Gender; Islamic tourism; Muslim women; Social media,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior and decision-making processes of Muslim women in the hospitality and tourism sector, which aligns with tactical marketing strategies aimed at this specific demographic.

"Purpose: Retailing in India is an unchartered territory. Food and grocery is the most promising area for setting up retail business in India. An understanding of shopper retail format choice behaviour will enable retailers to segment their market and target specific consumer groups with strategies premeditated to meet their retail needs. The purpose of this paper is to make a detailed study on the effect of shoppers' demographic, geographic and psychographic dimensions in terms of format choice behaviour in the fast growing Indian food and grocery retailing. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research design is adopted applying mall intercept survey method using structured questionnaire for data collection. Both descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistical tools like χ2, factor analysis and multivariate analysis are used to analyse the data collected from 1,040 food and grocery retail customers from upgraded neighbourhood kirana stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets in conjoint cities of Secunderabad and Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh in India. Findings: The findings suggest that shoppers' age, gender, occupation, education, monthly household income, family size and distance travelled to store have significant association with retail format choice decisions. The choice decisions are also varied among shoppers' demographic attributes. The findings from shoppers' psychographic dimensions like values, lifestyle factors and shopping orientations resulted in segmentation of food and grocery retail consumers into hedonic, utilitarian, autonomous, conventional and socialization type. Practical implications: The study has practical implications for food and grocery retailers for better understanding the shopper behaviour in the context of changing consumer demographic and psychographic characteristics in an emerging Indian retail market. The findings may help the retailers to segment and target the food and grocery retail consumers and, as a consequence, to undertake more effective retail marketing strategies for competitive advantage. Originality/value: Given the absence of published academic literature and empirical findings relating to store format choice behaviour in food and grocery retailing in India, this study may serve as a departure point for future studies in this area of concern. The research is also relevant to retail marketers in terms of format development and reorientation of marketing strategies in the fastest growing Indian retail market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Prasad C.J.; Aryasri A.R.,Strategic,10.1108/09590551111104486,Consumer behaviour; Demographics; India; Psychographics; Retailing,5.0,,5,0,,"The study primarily focuses on understanding shopper behavior and market segmentation in the context of food and grocery retailing in India, which aligns with long-term strategic goals of retailers to better target specific consumer groups and develop effective marketing strategies.",scopus-autonomous,60,30,Effect of shopper attributes on retail format choice behaviour for food and grocery retailing in India,2011
