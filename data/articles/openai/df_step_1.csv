Testing of minimization of subjectivity in best value procurement by using artificial intelligence systems in state of Utah procurement,Kashiwagi D.T.; Byfield R.,2002,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:6(496),"The Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS) was tested on the procurement of the $2.96 million Bridgerland Academic Training Center (ATC) for the state of Utah Division of Facilities Construction Management. The artificial intelligence (AI) information based PIPS was run two ways - selection with biased subjectivity (similar to current best value processes) and without biased subjectivity. Unlike other best value processes, PIPS minimizes the decision-making and subjective bias of the owner's representatives. The procurement test at Bridgerland ATC provides a comparison between the AI selection versus the user agency's subjective prioritization. The result of the system was one of the ""best"" construction projects procured at the state of Utah (on time, on budget, high quality), with no contractor generated change orders for additional cost, minimized construction management requirements, and high customer satisfaction.",Artificial intelligence; Construction; Cost control; Project management; Utah,,scopus-ai,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the implementation and outcomes of the Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS) in a significant procurement project, highlighting its long-term implications on decision-making processes in procurement by reducing bias and improving results.

Virtual reality’s impact on destination visit intentions and the moderating role of amateur photography,Morrison A.M.; Bag S.; Mandal K.,2024,10.1108/TR-12-2022-0621,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of virtual reality experiences (VREs) and emotions on holiday destination visit intentions by applying the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework. It also examined the role of amateur photography as a moderator in the relationship between VREs, emotions and visit intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were collected through a structured survey questionnaire administered in India, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine relationships among variables. The formal survey was preceded by a pilot study. The partial least squares-SEM product indicator technique was applied to measure the moderation effect of amateur photography. Findings: When people have high levels of positive emotions in the pre-travel stage with VRE participation, their intentions to visit destinations are stronger. Amateur photography moderated the relationships between user interactivity, memorable experiences, mental imagery and visit intentions. No significant moderating effect was found between emotional experiences and visit intentions. Practical implications: The results indicate that creators of virtual reality (VR) communications should concentrate on producing interactive and visually striking VR content, as the research found that VR experiences with tourism-related activities have a significant impact on potential visitor emotions. Therefore, VR producers should incorporate authentic and distinctive elements into contents, giving viewers realistic and trustworthy VR tourism experiences. Destination marketers should evoke emotions in people to increase motivations to visit the VR-presented places. Destination marketers should create VR content with hedonic elements, fostering a connection and desire to visit the destination presented in the VR. For example, destination marketers can enhance the sensory aspects of VR content with audio, video, haptics and artificial intelligence, encouraging people to be emotionally captivated and fully immersed. The findings indicate that amateur photography has a significant moderating effect on prospective tourists’ intentions to visit a place presented in VR. Thus, destination marketers are advised to provide photogenic and relevant content to users. By using amateur photography, destinations can market their attractions to potential visitors in a more interactive and relatable manner. Showcasing images taken by amateur photographers presents a genuine perspective of the offerings, thereby increasing visit intentions among prospective visitors. Additionally, amateur photography helps promote the destination in a positive light, emphasizing the attractions and other offerings, and this encourages potential visitors to consider the destination as a travel option, thereby increasing visit intentions. Encouraging amateur photographers to take and share images also increases their engagement with the destination, creating a sense of community and connection and ultimately driving visit intentions. Destination marketers should embrace VR tourism content as a means of promoting their destinations to potential customers by considering the three crucial elements of memorable experiences, emotional experiences and mental imagery. In essence, destination management organizations and other decision makers should develop complete VR communication plans that incorporate interactive and visually striking activities. This can be done by creating VR experiences for prospective tourists, which will enable them to pick their preferred destinations at the pre-travel stage. Through this approach, an effective destination marketing strategy can be established. Originality/value: This research has value in making several potential contributions to the tourism applications of VR. It is the first study to use and test the S-O-R framework to analyse tourist behaviour from the perspective of emotions generated by VR applications. The analysis focuses on India’s tourism market, which has not been explored much in the context of VR and from the perspective of a developing country. The research emphasizes the use of VR as a tool to understand tourist behaviour rather than just focusing on visit intentions. The findings provide valuable insights into the importance of VR in tourism. The knowledge generated will contribute to the understanding of the impact of VR experiences on emotions and visit intentions and the moderating effect of amateur photography. It has practical implications for destination marketers in developing effective marketing strategies that enhance tourists’ emotions and motivate visit intentions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Amateur photography; Emotional experiences; Holiday destinations; S-O-R framework; Structural equation modelling; Virtual reality experiences; Visit intentions,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence,Tactical,"The abstract discusses specific strategies for destination marketers to enhance virtual reality content and emotional engagement, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

Classification of potential electric vehicle purchasers: A machine learning approach,Bas J.; Cirillo C.; Cherchi E.,2021,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120759,"Among the many approaches towards fuel economy, the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) may have the greatest impact. However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users’ inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption. © 2021",Adoption; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicle; Imputation; Machine learning; Prediction,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-artificial intelligence,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the use of Machine Learning techniques to identify key elements in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, which aligns with tactical decision-making by providing structured approaches to target potential EV purchasers.

An explainable recommendation framework based on an improved knowledge graph attention network with massive volumes of side information,Shimizu R.; Matsutani M.; Goto M.,2022,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107970,"In recent years, explainable recommendation has been a topic of active study. This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model. Finally, a multifaceted analysis suggests that the proposed framework is not only effective as an explainable recommendation model but also provides a powerful tool for planning various marketing strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable recommendation; Knowledge graph attention network; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graph enabled recommendation; Model-intrinsic approach,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the development of an explainable recommendation framework that shows clear applications in marketing strategies and consumer behavior.

Defining an Integrated and Computed Methodology Approach for Sentiment and Psychographic Analysis in Tourism Research,Izzo F.; Picone Q.,2022,10.29036/jots.v13i25.393,"High-performance computational resources and artificial intelligence-based tools can enhance tourism research and marketing. However, a formal methodological approach using digital technologies in this field is still missing. This research work presents the preliminary results of defining an integrated computational methodology in tourism research and marketing. In addition, the paper aims to provide guidelines for a methodological approach leveraging technological resources and Big Data. The proposed research method is based on online User-Generated Content (UGC) analysis through a psychographic approach based on the Big Five Model, Sentiment Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques. The study is supported by high-performance computing resources, artificial intelligence-based tools, and open-source Python-based software for data collection, text analysis, and psychographic attribution. Results show a remarkable performance of the BFF prediction model and confirm the role of personality in the tourists’ decision-making and appreciation of a site. Future developments of this project involve using the acquired structured dataset labeled with sentiment and psychographic attribution to create a further prediction model on tourist segments and appreciation as part of a marketing strategy in tourism management. Future research should push forward the development of further integrated and performing computer-based methodology in tourism research and marketing, leveraging the massive amount of data and the potential of high-performance computing techniques.

UNIFYING ALGORITHMIC AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES: EMOTIONS IN ONLINE REVIEWS AND SALES,Yu Y.; Yang Y.; Huang J.; Tan Y.,2023,10.25300/MISQ/2022/16600,"Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations. © 2023 University of Minnesota.

Organizational frontlines in the digital age: The Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework,van Doorn J.; Smailhodzic E.; Puntoni S.; Li J.; Schumann J.H.; Holthöwer J.,2023,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114000,"While organizational frontlines in the digital age involve complex interactions between consumers, autonomous technology (AT), and frontline workers, research so far largely focuses on the effect of AT on either the consumer or the worker. Bridging the fields of marketing and organizational behavior, we develop the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects the implications of consumer–worker–AT interactions. We consider that AT can be consumer-facing, such as service robots, or worker-facing, such as AT-enabled knowledge-based systems supporting a worker's decision-making. Drawing on illustrative interviews in hospitality contexts with workers who co-work with robots and the consumers served, we develop research propositions that highlight avenues for future research. We expect consumer–worker relations to strengthen when AT augments instead of replaces the worker. Human leadership is critical for consumers’ and workers’ acceptance of AT, while AT anthropomorphism is less critical in the presence of a human worker. © 2023 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence; Automation; Human–machine collaboration; Robots; Service,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-artificial intelligence,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the Consumer–Autonomous Technology–Worker (CAW) framework, which reflects long-term implications and interactions between consumers, autonomous technology, and workers in organizational settings.

Exploring the generational influence on social media-based tourist decision-making in India,Gulati S.,2024,10.1108/IDD-11-2022-0115,"Purpose: This study aims to explore how social media affects decision-making among tourists and whether there is a potential effect of age, which is studied through generations. For this purpose, baby boomers, Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z tourists are studied and real-time implications are offered. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a descriptive and exploratory design where the conceptual model of social media-based decision-making is developed through a review of the literature. Quantitative analysis is conducted on primary data from 600 Indian tourists. This is done using a self-administered questionnaire adopted from Gulati (2022) after checking its validity and reliability. The statistical analysis for hypothesis testing is done using PLS-SEM path modelling on pooled data. To study the categorical moderating effect of generations, partial least squares multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA) is performed as a paired comparison on every successive generation. Findings: After testing every successive younger generation with an older generation through PLS-MGA, none of the pairs found any significant differences in path coefficients, as the values obtained were 0.05 < p < 0.95 for all five paths (SM → NR, SM → IS, SM → E, SM → P, SM → PPB). This indicates all the generations behave in a similar manner irrespective of them being older or younger, and age does not moderate social media’s impact on decision-making among Indian tourists. Research limitations/implications: The study establishes India as a unique geographical market and suggests tourism marketers to treat all generations at par, irrespective of age, as they behave and interact with social media in a similar manner. But, because this study is restricted to a single geographical location, i.e. India, further regions can be explored for global generalisation. Future research can also explore other demographics for combined, moderated analysis. Findings from the study suggest that marketers should ensure that equal attention is given to all generations as they engage with social media in a similar manner. Targeted marketing using artificial intelligence can help in ensuring custom ads. Personalisation according to generations can also facilitate greater purchases. Originality/value: The study fills a major population and knowledge gap by exploring a topic that has been highly under-researched. Also, the study adopts an inclusive approach by analysing all the generations, both younger and older, to understand the potential effect of age on moderating the impact that social media has on tourist decision-making.

The role of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in encouraging low- versus high-cost pro-environmental behaviors,Wan C.; Lee D.; Ng P.,2024,10.1002/mar.22013,"Virtual influencers have great potential to shape the audience's perception and motivate behavioral change. Drawing upon anthropomorphism theory and social identity theory, this paper examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in shaping audiences' trust and subsequently pro-environmental behaviors in low- and high-cost contexts. Two online studies employing experimental materials generated by artificial intelligence were conducted. Study 1 revealed that high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) and high racial homophily (local-like virtual influencers) are more effective for eliciting trust in the context of low-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) would further weaken the trust level of a virtual influencer in low anthropomorphism (animate-like virtual influencers). Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in the context of high-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) enhanced the trust in a high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) virtual influencer. The moderated mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. This research advanced our understanding on the moderating role of racial homophily that serves as a cognitive shortcut for low-cost and quick decisions. However, a low racial homophily (foreign-like) virtual influencer would be more effective for high-cost and symbolic pro-environmental behaviors.

The impact of marketing modification on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana,Abrokwah-Larbi K.; Awuku-Larbi Y.,2024,10.1108/JRME-01-2022-0010,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the effect of marketing modification on business performance from the perspective of marketing capabilities theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) – path analysis. Findings: According to the study’s findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: This current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implications: The outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implications: The application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/value: The study’s findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP). In terms of contribution, this study adds to the body of knowledge already available on marketing modification and business performance, particularly in the setting of an emerging economy. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business performance; Food processing SMEs; Ghana; Marketing modification,Emerald Publishing,scopus-artificial intelligence,Strategic,"The study examines the long-term impact of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs, aligning with strategic goals such as financial performance, customer performance, and overall business growth.

A decision support system to evaluate the quality and warranty policies for remanufactured products,Kuik S.; Ban J.; Diong L.; Qi X.,2023,10.1108/TQM-02-2022-0046,"Purpose: This paper proposes optimisation models to evaluate and examine the selling of extended warranty policies in terms of improved profits in producing/marketing remanufactured products. These models are numerically solved using a quadratic programming solution approach and implemented in the decision support system (DSS). Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of this paper is to develop the optimisation models for a DSS and evaluate different warranty policies for buyers. Findings: This study has demonstrated the flexibility and usefulness of a model-driven DSS for the quality and warranty management, which is applied to examine and evaluate different configurations (i.e. component reuse, rebuild and recycle) for remanufactured products and propose the selling of extended warranty policies for buyers. Research limitations/implications: The developed model-driven DSS can assist manufacturers to select and increase the number of components, e.g. to be reused, rebuilt, and recycled for producing a remanufactured product and propose suitable warranty policies for buyers. However, this study focusses only on the evaluation of warranty policies for specific remanufactured products in a DSS, i.e. types of air compressors for production operations in manufacturing industry.

Complementing human effort in online reviews: A deep learning approach to automatic content generation and review synthesis,Carlson K.; Kopalle P.K.; Riddell A.; Rockmore D.; Vana P.,2023,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.02.004,"Online product reviews are ubiquitous and helpful sources of information available to consumers for making purchase decisions. Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews.

Dark sides of artificial intelligence: The dangers of automated decision-making in search engine advertising,Schultz C.D.; Koch C.; Olbrich R.,2024,10.1002/asi.24798,"With the growing use of artificial intelligence, search engine providers are increasingly pushing advertisers to use automated bidding strategies based on machine learning. Such automated decision-making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision-making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long-term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference-in-differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self-regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision-making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps. © 2023 The Authors.

Time for marketing to embrace reinforcement learning,Murphy L.; Perales F.; Gopal A.; Gyurdieva Y.; Gueorguiev V.; Shandilya P.,2022,,"Since COVID-19 upended the world, marketers can no longer rely on historical data to inform their decisions. Channel splits have changed and online conversations have exploded. Marketing budgets have decreased as a percentage of revenue, meaning marketing funds must be used more effectively and efficiently than ever. Fortunately, the relatively new application of reinforcement learning — a data science approach — in marketing offers additional opportunities to gain competitive advantage using artificial intelligence. Unlike other types of machine learning, reinforcement learning uses algorithms that do not typically rely only on historical data sets, to learn to make predictions. Rather, these algorithms learn as humans often do, through trial and error, adjusting their ‘behaviour’ based on the outcomes of their actions. While the algorithms and computations behind reinforcement learning can be complex and sophisticated, its ability to deal with real-time decision making makes it an attractive option for marketers.

Little attention has been paid to the customers’ and job seekers’ perceptions of heavily technology-empowered organizations in the management and marketing literature. The purpose of this research is to fill this research gap. A between-subject experiment with fictitious brands was conducted with 239 subjects to answer four hypotheses about customers’ attitudes, intention to use the offer, intention to recommend the company to others, and job seekers’ intentions. The results show that an autonomous algorithm universally influences job seekers more than customer referral behaviors. People confronted with brochures from banks and hospitals that use autonomous technologies express a higher intention to work in such organizations than in analogous institutions that do not offer such a service. However, only in banks that use autonomous algorithms the customers have a more positive attitude and a higher intention to use or recommend the service. The hospital’s unknown brand does not benefit from such an advertising approach. This is the first study ever conducted with fictitious brands of banks and hospitals to investigate the referral towards companies using autonomous technologies.

Effects of influential factors and their interactions in information processing strategy adoption: The perspective from dual process theory,Liqiang H.; Kanliang W.,2021,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2021.06.001,"In the past decades, researchers in various areas of social and cognitive psychology have developed dual process theories of information processing. Although these theories differ on a variety of dimensions, including domains of application and specific definitions, they all share the basic assumption that two different modes of information processing operate in making judgments, decisions as well as in solving problems. In essence, the common distinction in dual process modes is between a fast, associative information process mode with low effort heuristics, and a slow, rule-based mode with high effort systematic process. On the basis of a brief theoretical development introduction, we illustrate how the dual process theory is manifested in various disciplines. Table 1 summarizes the different representations of dual process, including heuristic vs. systematic; peripheral route vs. central route; associative access vs. attitude construct; categorization vs. individuation; automatic contextual influences vs. correction; experiential vs. rational; impulsive vs. reflective; implicit vs. explicit. Later on, we discuss how different types of information processing modes are determined and what the main factors that may significantly influence information processing adoption. Several determinants are identified froma review of the extant literature; for instance, the involvement would be an influential factor that affects what type of information processing mode adopted. Specifically, if an information processor does not have a high level of involvement, it would be more likely of him / her to adopt a heuristic mode comparing with a systematic mode. Similarly, if a consumer does not in a focal status of high motivation, comparing with the one with a high level of motivation, he/ she would be more likely to adopt a heuristic mode. The related factors that are generally discussed in previous studied are shown in Table 2. Although we may learn that these factors as listed are playing significant roles in influencing what type of information processing mode adopted, little has been discussed in prior research in relation to the possible interaction effects that would play a role. In particular, we could conjecture that a higher level of motivation of information processor would be more likely to adopt systematic information processing mode, but what would be happen if the information processor does not have a higher level of ability to process the information in order to make a judgment or decision? Will the information processor adopt systematic mode or heuristic mode? Moreover, when we try to take the risk as an important factor into consideration, if the decision context is with a high risk, will the information processor adopt systematic processing mode even if he/ she does not have the ability to process related information? Whether the processor would adopt heuristic processing mode when he / she does not have the ability to process? This calls for future research to further explore more rich findings and interesting underlying mechanisms. The exploration of the impacts aroused by various influential factors would be a bright future. Future research could be extended on the basis of the current theory at least from the following three facets. First, the exploration of the theory application. As we discussed above, most of previous studies emphasize on investigating the independent effect of individual factor on information processing mode adoption, while little has been discussed on the underlying effects aroused by interactive factors in various contexts. Take the online product review context-a hot topic studied in information systems, marketing, as well as electronic commerce disciplines-as an example, our review of recent studies shows that although the dual process theories have been widely applied to examine the effects of online product reviews, or the review helpfulness itself, there is scant research regarding what factors that really determine which type of information processing mode used, and whether the information processing mode would be dynamically caused by various interactive factors. On the basis of the analysis of our paper which argues that the determinant factors that would be interactive in affecting the information processing mode, related future research with respect to this area could be widely extended. As regard to the research methodology in examining the focal theory, secondly, we call for more advanced method which could be used in future research in order to explore more interesting findings. Particularly, the current studies in relation to the dual process theories largely focus on experimental method or survey, while few attentions have been paid by using behavioral data to deduce what type of information processing mode being used. Based on the research logic presented by recent seminal papers such as Gladstone et al., Stachl et al. and Wu et al., we think it is feasible to extend the method scope to examine this theory. In addition, third, with respect to the extension of the theory itself, in line the recent arguments of seminal papers published on Nature (Rahwan et al.) and California Management Review (Huang et al., we may conjecture that the dual process theory could be extended in the new artificial intelligence era. In particular, during the interaction between human and robot (artificial intelligence), it is imperative to understand whether the robot, cognitively, will use these two different types of processing modes in their information processing like human? How would the robot be in the eye of human when the brain becomes to integrate with robot? Will the robot be the third processing mode complementing with the original two processing mode? Or will the robot interrupt the original two processing modes? Or will the robot replace the one type of either processing mode? We call for future research to further explore the bright and interesting area to explore the effects of interaction between human and robot. © 2021.

The effect of supply chain finance on sustainability performance: empirical analysis and fsQCA,Wang S.; Yu H.; Wei M.,2023,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,"Purpose: In the context of global economic downturn and intense competition, firms are increasingly resorting to supply chains to acquire capital support and achieve sustainability. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP – namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) – the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF’s effects on CSP. Findings: The authors find that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP’s positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF’s promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implications: This study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF’s effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF’s role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain – namely, core firm–suppliers and core firm–customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implications: First, our findings indicate that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to “do good.” The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/value: This study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power.

The paradox of technology: Negativity bias in consumer adoption of innovative technologies,Frank D.-A.; Chrysochou P.; Mitkidis P.,2023,10.1002/mar.21740,"Innovative technologies often feature inherently conflicting properties. This poses a challenge for marketers because negative properties not only weigh heavily on consumers' technology adoption decisions but potentially do more so than positive ones. To shed light on the paradox of technology and its underlying processes, the present research develops a conceptual model drawing on technology adoption and valence perception theories about the prevalence of negativity bias in consumers' technology adoption decisions with its unique effect through the serial chain of consumers' perceptions of risk and trust regarding the technology. Results of three studies (N = 1309) demonstrate that the effect of negative valence consistently outperforms that of positive valence in consumers' technology adoption intentions (Studies 1–2) and decisions (Study 3). Furthermore, results show that the disproportionate effect of negative (vs. positive) valence can be explained by the proposed serial causal chain through consumers' perception of risk of the technology and trust in the technology (Studies 2–3) while ruling out company trust and consumer knowledge as alternative drivers of the effects (Study 3). These findings contribute to the pertinent literature on consumer psychology in decisions to adopt novel technologies in that they quantify and explain the potential outcome stemming from the ambiguous properties of novel technology. Moreover, this study finds negativity bias to be an often overlooked consumer bias with implications for marketing practice and useful for understanding and lowering resistance towards artificial intelligence technology. © 2022 The Authors.

The consumer decision journey: A literature review of the foundational models and theories and a future perspective,Santos S.; Gonçalves H.M.,2021,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121117,"The consumer decision journey model has become increasingly important to understand consumer decision-making processes. Although the term originally emerged with Court et al. in 2009, the various current perspectives of the consumer journey suggest the existence of distinct literature and theoretical roots that have yet to be fully explored in detail. The objective of the paper is to semi-systematically review the main theories and models that constitute the foundation on which the consumer journey has evolved. Furthermore, given the lack of academic studies reflecting on the influence of more recent technologies based on artificial intelligence on the consumer journey, this study aims to fill this gap in an attempt to mold further theory development around the consumer journey concept. 74 relevant papers were retrieved mainly from a detailed search on SCOPUS, as well as a backward and forward citation analysis.

Technology and Entrepreneurial Marketing Decisions During COVID-19,Polas M.R.H.; Raju V.,2021,10.1007/s40171-021-00262-0,"The prime concern of this study is to explore how technology influences entrepreneurial marketing decisions during the world pandemic (COVID-19). The study uses a sample of 127 SMEs from Bangladesh. Data were collected by sending out questionnaires electronically and by mail. Smart PLS (SEM) 3.0 was used to analyse the data following the quantitative method. The study reveals positive and significant relationships between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, opportunity development and opportunity exploitation with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. It also claims that entrepreneurial passion mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and opportunity development with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. However, entrepreneurial passion does not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation and entrepreneurial marketing decisions.

What Drives Consumers’ Decisions to Use Intelligent Agent Technologies? A Systematic Review,Sidlauskiene J.,2022,10.1080/15332861.2021.1961192,"As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it will increasingly empower the successful use of intelligent agent (IA) technologies in marketing practices. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer’s perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers’ intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Antecedents; artificial intelligence; intelligent agent technologies; representation theory; systematic literature review; technology acceptance,Routledge,scopus-artificial intelligence,Strategic,"The paper discusses the long-term implications of artificial intelligence in marketing practices, highlighting the need for a new theoretical framework to understand intelligent agent use.

A Machine Learning Framework towards Bank Telemarketing Prediction,Tékouabou S.C.K.; Gherghina Ş.C.; Toulni H.; Mata P.N.; Mata M.N.; Martins J.M.,2022,10.3390/jrfm15060269,"The use of machine learning (ML) methods has been widely discussed for over a decade. The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 by the authors.

Over a decade of social opinion mining: a systematic review,Cortis K.; Davis B.,2021,10.1007/s10462-021-10030-2,"Social media popularity and importance is on the increase due to people using it for various types of social interaction across multiple channels. This systematic review focuses on the evolving research area of Social Opinion Mining, tasked with the identification of multiple opinion dimensions, such as subjectivity, sentiment polarity, emotion, affect, sarcasm and irony, from user-generated content represented across multiple social media platforms and in various media formats, like text, image, video and audio. Through Social Opinion Mining, natural language can be understood in terms of the different opinion dimensions, as expressed by humans. This contributes towards the evolution of Artificial Intelligence which in turn helps the advancement of several real-world use cases, such as customer service and decision making. A thorough systematic review was carried out on Social Opinion Mining research which totals 485 published studies and spans a period of twelve years between 2007 and 2018. The in-depth analysis focuses on the social media platforms, techniques, social datasets, language, modality, tools and technologies, and other aspects derived. Social Opinion Mining can be utilised in many application areas, ranging from marketing, advertising and sales for product/service management, and in multiple domains and industries, such as politics, technology, finance, healthcare, sports and government.

A multi-criteria intelligence aid approach to selecting strategic key opinion leaders in digital business management,Lam H.Y.; Tang V.; Wu C.H.; Cho V.,2024,10.1016/j.jik.2024.100502,"In the wake of the global disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, digital channels have emerged as a significant driver of business sales. As such, the value of digital business management has received considerable attention from industrial practitioners. Beyond conventional promotion techniques, collaboration with digital market influencers has shown significant potential for business organisations by creating a circle of trust. However, managing influencers in the business-to-business market is far more complex than in business-to-consumer markets, as it involves balancing business processes, competitive advantages, company image and risks rather than solely motivating customer engagement. It is, therefore, critical for organisations to carefully select key opinion leaders (KOLs). To address this challenge, this study introduces an intelligent multi-criteria KOL analytics framework that embeds the fuzzy best-worst method and the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. The framework converts subjective and linguistic criteria, determines the attribute most relevant to the business, and then selects the most suitable KOLs for the campaign. A case study was conducted in partnership with a digital marketing agency in Hong Kong to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this approach. This model facilitates the evolution of digital business management by systematically identifying and assessing KOLs, contributing to significant changes in the digital business environment for companies. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Business-to-business; Digital business management; Key opinion leaders; Multi-criteria decision-making,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-artificial intelligence,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the implementation of an intelligent multi-criteria KOL analytics framework, which is focused on selecting key opinion leaders for marketing campaigns.

Toward a decision-making system based on artificial intelligence for precision marketing: A case study of Morocco,El Koufi N.; Belangour A.; sadiq M.,2024,10.1016/j.joitmc.2024.100250,"The insurance sector plays a crucial role in fostering sustainable economic development within a country. As the customer base grows, insurance companies must prioritize transitioning to data-driven strategies to cut costs and make more informed marketing choices in today's digital era. This study proposes a new decision-making framework for precision marketing, based on a real case study from a Moroccan insurance company that aims to solve a practical problem. The proposed decision-making system consists of four components, with each component involving important steps. Firstly, data preparation was performed, consisting of four critical stages: data acquisition, data cleaning and filtering, feature selection, and oversampling. Secondly, top 20% and top 50% consumers are taken as examples to present their customer persona in detail. Based on the processed data, we analysed consumer consumption behaviors using four ML algorithms and made a performance comparison of the four algorithms. Additionally, we conducted feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features and evaluate the system's performance. The aim of the proposed precision decision-making system is to assist managers in discerning the distinctive characteristics of potential customers and proposing tailored precision marketing strategies. This approach is expected to substantially reduce advertising expenses and enhance overall marketing efficiency.

Does the belief of farmers on land as God influence the adoption of smart farming technologies?,Vasan M.; Yoganandan G.,2023,10.1108/BIJ-10-2022-0645,"Purpose: Artificial Intelligence-based smart farming technologies have brought impressive changes in farming. This paper aims at exploring the farmers’ intention to adopt smart farming technologies (SFT). Also, the authors intend to know how far the belief of farmers on land as God influences their decision to adopt SFT. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from 500 farmers chosen purposively. A well-crafted survey instrument was employed to amass data from farmers for measuring their adoption of SFT. As the authors sought to measure the farmers’ behavioural intention (BI) towards the adoption of SFT, the technology acceptance model developed by Davis (1989) came in handy, including perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and BI. The authors have adopted this model as it was considered a superior model. The items on the attitude of confidence (AC) were adapted from Adrian et al. (2005). Survey instruments of Thompson and Higgins (1991) and Compeau and Higgins (1995) were also referred to finalize the statements relating to attitude towards use. Moreover, the authors developed items relating to the perceived belief of land as God based on frequent interaction with the farmers. Findings: The study results divulged that attitude to use (AU) is directly influenced by the rural farmers’ PU, PEU and AC. Similarly, this investigation has observed behaviour intention directly influenced by the AU of farmers. It is observed that AU was the most influential variable, which ultimately influenced the BI to use SFT. Research limitations/implications: This study has an important limitation in the form of representing only the culture, belief and value system of farmers in India. Practical implications: The outcome of this study will facilitate the policymakers to draw suitable policy measures keeping the sensitivities of the farmers in mind in their technology adoption drive. The agricultural officers can encourage farmers to take logical decisions by supplying adequate information in a time-bound manner. Marketers can make suitable adjustments in their sales and promotion activities that focus on farmers. Social implications: The belief of farmers on land as God has a small yet unmissable influence on farmers’ AU and BI in their technology adoption decision. Based on the above evidence, the authors recommend that marketers fine-tune their product design, product packaging and promotional activities keeping the belief and sensitivities of farmers at the core of their marketing campaign. Originality/value: This article provides original insights by demonstrating the positive influence of PU, PEU and AC on technology adoption by farmers.

A dynamic decision support system to predict the value of customer for new product development,Chan S.L.; Ip W.H.,2011,10.1016/j.dss.2011.07.002,"In recent years, firms have focused on how to enter markets and meet customer requirements by improving product attributes and processes to boost their market share and profits. Consequently, market-driven product design and development has become a popular topic in the literature. However, past research neither covers all of the major influencing factors that together drive customers to make purchase decisions, nor connects these various influencing factors to customer purchasing behavior. Past studies further fail to take the time value of money and customer value into consideration. This study proposes a decision support system to (a) predict customer purchasing behavior given certain product, customer, and marketing influencing factors, and (b) estimate the net customer lifetime value from customer purchasing behavior toward a specific product. This will not only enable decision-makers to compare alternatives and select competitive products to launch on the market, but will also improve the understanding of customer behavior toward particular products for the formulation of effective marketing strategies that increase customer loyalty and generate greater profits in the long term.

This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets.

A model-based decision support system for locating banks,Min H.,1989,10.1016/0378-7206(89)90044-X,"The proper location of branch-banks is critical to the success of the banking business. The major ingredients for deciding where to locate branch-banks are: growth rates of deposits and loans; degree of competition; easy accessibility, and operating costs of potential sites. These are often highly sensitive to socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that are ill-defined and fuzzy in nature. Accordingly, the traditional normative approach alone cannot analyze the excessive location-related data associated with the external factors and cannot appropriately evaluate behavioral criteria for branch-bank sites.

Retailers in consumer products industry are getting shorter lead time to respond to market demand. To meet this challenge, many rely on third party supply chain managers (SCMs) for economically supplying required quantities of finished products quickly. However, due to shorter time to market, the SCM has to procure raw materials and start production process based on expected demand. Since SCM absorbs financial penalties associated with under-and over-estimation of demand from retailer, finding an optimal production lot size and product customisation strategy are essential to an SCM's operation. We develop a profit maximisation model and provide a close-form solution that allows an SCM to calculate optimal production lot size.

Towards ubiquitous information supply for individual investors: A decision support system design,Muntermann J.,2009,10.1016/j.dss.2009.01.003,"This paper introduces an IT artifact called MoFiN DSS that comprises hard- and software components that provide the basis for a prototype of a financial decision support system (DSS) to support individual investors reacting to unforeseen market events. We have derived our motivation for building such a system design from behavioral finance research. Analyses of the behavior of individual investors provide evidence that this segment does react more significantly to any public news published compared to institutional investors. On the other hand, the analyses show that they react significantly slower than their institutional counterparts. Since empirical intraday event study analyses show that capital markets react promptly to new information and that excess returns decrease over a specific period of time, individual investors miss significant trading opportunities due to their current strategies of information research. We address the problem that this market segment is not able to continuously observe diverse information channels and to assess all the new information available. Our prototype decision support system continuously observes company announcements and forecasts their potential impact on the corresponding stock price. After identifying those events for which significant market reactions can be expected, wireless push-based message services provide the technical basis for prompt and location-independent information supply. Based on a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology we have developed, we demonstrate and quantify the advantages that the developed system provides to the individual investors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Models for the design and operation of digital educational environments,Solovov A.V.; Menshikova A.A.,2021,10.31992/0869-3617-2021-30-1-144-155,"Many educational institutions, assessing their prospects, plan to develop distance educational services using their own electronic and information educational environments (EIEE). During creating and operating EIEE of educational institution (EI), a number of questions arise related to structural, marketing, personnel and other decisions. The purpose of this article is to research the organizational, technical and didactic aspects of the EIEE EI. The methodology of the research is based on methods of system analysis, cybernetics, pedagogical psychology and didacticism. A conceptual model of the EIEE EI as an organizational and technical system has been proposed. It includes a marketing subsystem, a set of technical tools, various types of security and an organizational subsystem. The main functions of these subsystems and their various components have been identified. A didactic model of a typical complex of digital educational resources has been developed. Within this model, the diversity of digital educational resources across each academic discipline is integrated into complexes that provide a complete study at different target levels of assimilation, from initial acquaintance to solving uncharacteristic professionally oriented tasks. From the point of view of pedagogical psychology and cybernetics, the high importance of feedback in EIEE EI is shown. The classification of feedbacks (internal and external) is proposed for the triad ""Teacher - Teaching Program - Learner"". The limits of the use of automation in the formation of feedbacks are specified, as opposed to other (non-computer) responses to students' educational activities.

Community-based influence maximization in social networks under a competitive linear threshold model,Bozorgi A.; Samet S.; Kwisthout J.; Wareham T.,2017,10.1016/j.knosys.2017.07.029,"The main purpose in influence maximization, which is motivated by the idea of viral marketing in social networks, is to find a subset of key users that maximize influence spread under a certain propagation model. A number of studies have been done over the past few years that try to solve this problem by considering a non-adversarial environment in which there exists only one player with no competitor. However, in real world scenarios, there is always more than one player competing with other players to influence the most nodes. This is called competitive influence maximization. Motivated by this, we try to solve the competitive influence maximization problem by proposing a new propagation model which is an extension of the Linear Threshold model and gives decision-making ability to nodes about incoming influence spread. We also propose an efficient algorithm for finding the influential nodes in a given social graph under the proposed propagation model which exploits the community structure of this graph to compute the spread of each node locally within its own community. The aim of our algorithm is to find the minimum number of seed nodes which can achieve higher spread in comparison with the spread achieved by nodes selected by other competitor.

Knowledge-collector agents: Applying intelligent agents in marketing decisions with knowledge management approach,Moradi M.; Aghaie A.; Hosseini M.,2013,10.1016/j.knosys.2013.08.014,"Marketing plays an essential role in the competitive business environment. Marketing decision makers constantly need to monitor changes in the environment and organization to make necessary changes. Therefore, a knowledge management (KM) system is required to acquire, store, retrieve and use up-to-date knowledge. Corporations also tend to look for systems to assist them in knowledge management. Agent technology looks set for assisting organizations in collecting, processing and using knowledge with high accuracy, speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for marketing decision making through using agent technology, fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy AHP is used for allocating the weight of determinant criteria and fuzzy logic is deployed for determining the final decision in pessimistic, moderate and optimistic satiations. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) developing a knowledge management framework for capturing, storing, disseminating and utilizing marketing knowledge by using agent system, and (b) helping marketing decision makers to make effective decisions based on useful knowledge, and (c) encouraging marketing decisions towards the intelligence.

Brand-managing activities are typically related to brand positioning and integration with marketing campaigns, and can involve complex decisions. The branding of an organization is indeed a dynamic system with many cause-effect relationships as well as intangible and heterogeneous variables. In order to help brand managers and marketers, we propose a decision support system, named Identimod, for modeling and evaluating branding strategies. Identimod uses non-linear dynamic modeling and soft computing to identify the branding system from different data sources through a linguistic user interface, and to provide advanced methods for diagnostics and validation. Identimod steps through a participatory, cyclic, and iterative process consisting of four different modules to increase the confidence and validity of the model, which should facilitate its acceptance by managers and stakeholders.

A decision support framework to implement optimal personalized marketing interventions,Guelman L.; Guillén M.; Pérez-Marín A.M.,2015,10.1016/j.dss.2015.01.010,"In many important settings, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to a stimulus or ""treatment."" For instance, a treatment that works for the overall population might be highly ineffective, or even harmful, for a subgroup of subjects with specific characteristics. Similarly, a new treatment may not be better than an existing treatment in the overall population, but there is likely a subgroup of subjects who would benefit from it. The notion that ""one size may not fit all"" is becoming increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from economics to medicine. This has drawn significant attention to personalize the choice of treatment, so it is optimal for each individual. An optimal personalized treatment is the one that maximizes the probability of a desirable outcome. We call the task of learning the optimal personalized treatment personalized treatment learning. From the statistical learning perspective, this problem imposes important challenges, primarily because the optimal treatment is unknown on a given training set. A number of statistical methods have been proposed recently to tackle this problem. However, considering the critical importance of these methods to decision support systems, personalized treatment learning models have received relatively little attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method labeled causal conditional inference trees and its natural extension to causal conditional inference forests. The performance of the new method is analyzed and compared to alternative methods for personalized treatment learning. The results show that our new proposed method often outperforms the alternatives on the numerical settings described in this article.

Identification of influencers - Measuring influence in customer networks,Kiss C.; Bichler M.,2008,10.1016/j.dss.2008.06.007,"Viral marketing refers to marketing techniques that use social networks to produce increases in brand awareness through self-replicating viral diffusion of messages, analogous to the spread of pathological and computer viruses. The idea has successfully been used by marketers to reach a large number of customers rapidly.

Usage stimulation and churn management are examples of DSS applications, where centrality of customers does play a role. The literature on network theory describes a large number of such centrality measures. A critical question is which of these measures is best to select an initial set of customers for a marketing campaign, in order to achieve a maximum dissemination of messages. In this paper, we present the results of computational experiments based on call data from a telecom company to compare different centrality measures for the diffusion of marketing messages.

A comparative study of hybrid machine learning techniques for customer lifetime value prediction,Tsai C.-F.; hu Y.-H.; Hung C.-S.; Hsu Y.-F.,2013,10.1108/03684921311323626,"Customer lifetime value (CLV) has received increasing attention in database marketing. Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonlyused hybrid models by classification+classification and clustering+classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a twostage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to preprocess the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and kmeans and selforganizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification+classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining twostage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type I/II errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent).

A sampling based sentiment mining approach for e-commerce applications,Vinodhini G.; Chandrasekaran R.M.,2017,10.1016/j.ipm.2016.08.003,"Emerging technologies in online commerce, mobile and customer experience have transformed the retail industry so as to enable the marketers to boost sales and the customers with the most efficient online shopping. Online reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and marketing strategies employed by vendors in e-commerce. However, the vast amount of reviews makes it difficult for the customers to mine sentiments from online reviews. To address this problem, sentiment mining system is needed to organize the online reviews automatically into different sentiment orientation categories (e.g. positive/negative). Due to the imbalanced nature of positive and negative sentiments, the real time sentiment mining is a challenging machine learning task. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the combined effect of machine learning classifiers and sampling methods in sentiment classification under imbalanced data distributions. A modification is proposed in support vector machine based ensemble algorithm which incorporates both oversampling and undersampling to improve the prediction performance.

The BIG CHASE: A decision support system for client acquisition applied to financial networks,Quijano-Sanchez L.; Liberatore F.,2017,10.1016/j.dss.2017.04.007,"Bank agencies daily store a huge volume of data regarding clients and their operations. This information, in turn, can be used for marketing purposes to acquire new clients or sell products to existing clients. A Decision Support System (DSS) can help a manager to decide the sequence of clients to contact to reach a designed target. In this paper we present the BIG CHASE, a DSS that translates bank data into a reliability graph. This graph models relationships based on a probability of traversal function that includes social measures. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with Banco Santander, S.A., fits the parameters of the probability function to explicit solution evaluations given by experts by means of a specifically designed Projected Gradient Descent algorithm. The fitted probability function determines the reliabilities associated to the edges of the graph. An optimization procedure tailored to be efficient on very large sparse graphs with millions of nodes and edges identifies the most reliable sequence of clients that a manager should contact to reach a specific target. The BIG CHASE has been tested with a case study on real data that includes Banco Santander, S.A. 2015 Spain bank records.

Decision-centric active learning of binary-outcome models,Saar-Tsechansky M.; Provost F.,2007,10.1287/isre.1070.0111,"It can be expensive to acquire the data required for businesses to employ data-driven predictive modeling - for example, to model consumer preferences to optimize targeting. Prior research has introduced ""active-learning"" policies for identifying data that are particularly useful for model induction, with the goal of decreasing the statistical error for a given acquisition cost (error-centric approaches). However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly. We also show that this method is robust in the face of decreasing quality of utility estimations, eventually converging to uniform random sampling, and that it can be extended to situations where different data acquisitions have different costs. The results suggest that businesses should consider modifying their strategies for acquiring information through normal business transactions. For example, a firm such as Amazon.com that models consumer preferences for customized marketing may accelerate learning by proactively offering recommendations - not merely to induce immediate sales, but for improving recommendations in the future. © 2007 INFORMS.",Active learning; Classifier induction; Decision making; Decision-support systems; Predictive modeling,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-artificial intelligence,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a new decision-centric approach to active data acquisition, which emphasizes how data acquisition affects decision-making in marketing contexts.

Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm’s offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term.

"Predicting consumer behavior in the perspective of consumer neuroscience: Status, challenge, and future",Lei W.; Yikai Y.; Jiehui Z.; Xiaoyi W.,2020,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2020.06.001,"Neuromanagement is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that intersects neuroscience and social science. It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

Analysis of Online Consumer Behavior - Design of CRISP-DM Process Model,Exenberger E.; Bucko J.,2020,10.7160/AOL.2020.120302,"The basis of the modern marketing of a business entity is to know the behavior of its customers. Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior. To reach the main goal we perform a data analysis of the online sales data by using machine learning methods as clustering, decision tree and association rules mining. After evaluating the proposed model, we discuss its use of the proposed model in the field of internet sales in the agricultural sector.; JEL Classification: C53, D11, D91, M21, M31 © 2020",association rules; Classification; consumer behavior; data analysis; online shopping,Faculty of Economics and Management,scopus-artificial intelligence,Tactical,"The abstract focuses on applying advanced AI methods like data mining and machine learning to analyze online customer behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

Autonomous Shopping Systems: Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Consumer Adoption,de Bellis E.; Venkataramani Johar G.,2020,10.1016/j.jretai.2019.12.004,"Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous, able to make decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Whereas the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human–machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human–computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey. The article finishes with implications for policy makers and a future research agenda for researchers examining autonomous technologies. © 2019 The Authors",Adoption barrier; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous technology; Shopping behavior; Smart product; Task delegation,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-artificial intelligence,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications and challenges associated with adopting autonomous shopping systems, focusing on psychological and cultural barriers, which aligns with strategic planning in marketing.",60,20,15,0,5
DSS and GIS in knowledge transformation process,Klimešová D.; Brožová H.,2009,,"Knowledge is an important resource for successful decision-making process in the whole society today. The special procedures of control and management of knowledge therefore have to be used. In the area of knowledge management and knowledge engineering basic terms of these disciplines are data, information, knowledge and knowledge transformation. The knowledge can be defined as a dynamic human process of justifying personal beliefs. Knowledge is a product of successful decision-making process. Knowledge transformation is a spiralling process of interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge that leads to the new knowledge. Nonaka and al (2000) show, that the combination of these two categories makes possible to conceptualise four conversion steps: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation (SECI model). Another model of knowledge creation is the Knowledge Transformation Continuum (BCI Knowledge Group) that begins with the articulation of a specific instruction representing the best way that a specific task, or series of tasks, should be performed. Knowledge modelling and knowledge representation is an important field of research also in Computer Science andArtificial Intelligence. The definition of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is a noticeable different, because Artificial Intelligence is typically dealing with formalized knowledge (e.g. ontology). The development of knowledge-based systems was seen as a process of transferring human knowledge to an implemented knowledge base. Decision Support Systems (DSS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) modelling process support decision-making process, therefore they also produce a new knowledge. A Decision Support Systems are an interactive computer-based systems helping decision makers complete decision process. Geographic Information Systems provide essential marketing and customer intelligence solutions that lead to better business decisions. Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) is methodology based on system theory and theory of modelling. The OR/MS models serve for better quantification and precision of decision-making process. In this contribution the role of DSS, GIS and OR/MS models in the process of knowledge creation will be explained. The tacit or explicit character of this knowledge and the process of its creation will be explained and discussed. © 2009, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

A fuzzy GSS framework for organizational knowledge acquisition,Lee J.-N.; Kwok R.C.-W.,2000,10.1016/S0268-4012(00)00030-X,"Although the concept of viewing knowledge as a critical resource has been widely accepted in prior studies, it is not fully understood how to acquire available knowledge in order to improve organizational effectiveness. However, it is sure that organizational knowledge management should pursue the achievement of the business goal by delivering relevant and useful information to the right person at the right time. Group Support Systems (GSS) can play an important role in transfering scattered information into meaningful business knowledge for supporting strategic corporate decision-making. This study proposes a fuzzy GSS framework for acquiring workgroup knowledge from individual memory and aggregating workgroup knowledge into organizational knowledge. This study also proposes an architecture to support the fuzzy GSS framework. The architecture consists of user agents, information management agents, and a fuzzy model manager. To illustrate how the fuzzy GSS framework can be used to support the whole process of organizational knowledge acquisition, an Internet-based GSS was developed and applied in a marketing decision process. It showed that the framework was effective for acquiring organizational knowledge. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
