"Segmentation is a common and important task for most marketing departments. Besides, other marketing decisions are influenced by market segmentation results. Benefit segmentation is one of the best approaches for market segmentation among others. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid benefit segmentation approach which applied two-stage clustering, conjoint analysis, and Delphi technique to segment customers according to their benefits. More precisely, we used two-stage clustering based on main benefits derived from conjoint analysis to classify customers into different segments. Conjoint analysis was used to assess and balance dissimilar aspects of consumers needs. Delphi method was used for the selection of the most important criteria and their levels which conjoint analysis required all of them for evaluation. This approach did not only help managers to segment customers but also to provide a way to analyse consumer behaviour, determine the marking strategy and extract the importance of each attribute in each segment. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Aghdaie M.H.; Tafreshi P.F.; Behzadian M.,Tactical,10.1504/IJBIR.2014.059532,Benefit segmentation; Conjoint analysis; Delphi method; Iran; K-means clustering; Laptop market; Market segmentation; Two-stage clustering; Wards method,5.0,,15,0,Inderscience Publishers,"The abstract describes a hybrid benefit segmentation approach that involves structured decision-making processes like clustering and conjoint analysis, aimed at addressing specific marketing targets such as customer segmentation and behavior analysis.

"Category management (CM) plays an increasingly important role in retailing management, as it aids retailers to increase their core competitiveness, maximise profits and ensure a good long-term customer relationship. This technique has been successfully applied to diverse large manufacturers and wholesale retailers. However, it remains a challenging task to directly employ the CM technique in convenience store (CVS) chain(s). This is because CVS chains are often distributed in a variety of areas, each store has impulsive consumers, and the traditional market segmentation attributes (e.g. consumer age, salary, and background) are difficult to collect under such circumstances. This makes it impractical to apply one general CM solution to all CVS chains. Hence, it is crucial to segment a market region and then apply customised CM solutions to the corresponding segments. This paper presents an innovative market segmentation model which is driven by category-role (CR), for the first time, to support CM in CVS chains. A new similarity measure (named HCsim()) and an improved weighted fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm (WFKM) are developed in an effort to cluster the CVSs. The usefulness and applicability of this study is illustrated by means of an empirical study to provide marketing strategy decision support. The derived results are also discussed and compared with existing methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Han S.; Ye Y.; Fu X.; Chen Z.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2013.09.017,Category management; Convenience store chain management; Market segmentation; Strategic decision support,0.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a customized category management solution for convenience store chains, emphasizing the segmentation of market regions and the application of specific marketing strategies.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new RFM model called length, recency, frequency, monetary and periodicity (LRFMP) for classifying customers in the grocery retail industry; and to identify different customer segments in this industry based on the proposed model. Design/methodology/approach: This study combines the LRFMP model and clustering for customer segmentation. Real-life data from a grocery chain operating in Turkey is used. Three cluster validation indices are used for optimizing the number of groups of customers and K-means algorithm is employed to cluster customers. First, attributes of the LRFMP model are extracted for each customer, and then based on LRFMP model features, customers are segmented into different customer groups. Finally, identified customer segments are profiled based on LRFMP characteristics and for each customer profile, unique CRM and marketing strategies are recommended. Findings: The results show that there are five different customer groups and based on LRFMP characteristics, they are profiled as: “high-contribution loyal customers,” “low-contribution loyal customers,” “uncertain customers,” “high-spending lost customers” and “low-spending lost customers.” Practical implications: This research may provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic guideline for effectively identifying different customer profiles based on the LRFMP model, give grocery companies useful insights about different customer profiles, and assist decision makers in developing effective customer relationships and unique marketing strategies, and further allocating resources efficiently. Originality/value: This study contributes to prior literature by proposing a new RFM model, called LRFMP for the customer segmentation and providing useful insights about behaviors of different customer types in the Turkish grocery industry. It is also precious from the point of view that it is one of the first attempts in the literature which investigates the customer segmentation in the grocery retail industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Peker S.; Kocyigit A.; Eren P.E.,Tactical,10.1108/MIP-11-2016-0210,CRM; Customer relations; Customer segmentation; Grocery retail industry; Marketing strategy; RFM model,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract describes a study that proposes a new model for customer segmentation and clustering, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into specific targets and structured decision-making processes.

"This study focuses on the regional tourism market around Buffalo, NY to investigate the relative importance of city brand and other city attributes in tourists' decision making about where to visit for a short weekend trip. A content analysis was used to identify the four competitor cities of Buffalo and the key attributes that the cities possess to attract tourists in the regional driving tourism market. Within the context of destination choice-sets model, the relative importance of the key attributes including city brands was investigated through a choice-based conjoint analysis. Shopping opportunities was found as the most important attribute, followed by restaurant/food, culture/festivals, sports, nature-based attractions, and city brand. Based on the relative importance of the attributes at an individual level, three distinctive tourist segments-Food and Shopping Lovers, City-Driven Do-It-All Tourists, and Cultural Tourists-were generated from a K-means cluster analysis. Different city attribute profiles were identified for those five cities. Implications and suggestions were presented to promote more efficient marketing efforts for regional tourism destinations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Huang C.; Oh K.; Zhang Q.; Choi Y.-J.,Tactical,10.1080/10548408.2013.827544,choice-sets model; city brand; conjoint analysis; destination branding; Regional tourism market,5.0,,15,0,,"The study analyzes specific attributes influencing tourist decisions, which can be directly applied to marketing strategies and campaigns for regional tourism destinations.

Brand equity measurement is the premise and basis for enterprises to formulate brand strategies and to plan marketing activities. The difficulty of measuring brand equity has been a problem that has plagued the industry for many years and needs to be solved due to the many models miscellaneous methods difficulties in unification and insensitivity of brand equity measurement. Brand equity measurement can be operated from finance market and consumer perspectives while marketers often measure brand equity from a consumer perspective as they focus on brand communication and sales issues. Traditional approaches for brand equity measurement mainly utilize consumer surveys a major limitation of which is that the respondents are highly susceptible to the influence of research instruments such as survey design and intention of the researchers. Additionally survey respondents may be unable or unwilling to express the actual hidden opinions. Traditional approaches are also limited for low efficiency in data collection which leads to delayed reporting high cost and insensitive results and therefore they may be difficult to provide timely information for marketing decisions. With the diffusion of social media consumers are provided with a greater ability to express their opinions freely on social networks. Clothing consumers in particular appear highly active on social media largely because clothing products can provide a lot of worthy topics for social conversations. In this background social listening which monitors naturally occurring brand-related consumer conversations on social networks provides an alternative data source for brand equity measurement for clothing brands. To address the problems of slow response time high cost and insensitive results of traditional brand equity measurement methods the research proposes and validates a method of measuring apparel brand equity based on social listening data by taking into account the characteristics of apparel brands. The proposed method applied consumer-based brand equity framework to social listening data which was obtained with web crawling technologies. The research first developed a framework of seven dimensions of brand benefits for clothing brands based on Keller's brand equity theory which involves brand benefits association in brand image. The seven dimensions include expertise quality aesthetics entertainment social identity fashionability and individuality. The research utilized Sina Weibo as the source of social listening data and selected brand N a leading international sports wear brand as the case to illustrate the proposed approach. Using a web crawling technology the research obtained a total of 54 360 consumer conversations of this brand on Sina Weibo for the year of 2021 involving 5 032 samples and 49 328 pieces of full data. Next the research used the keyword extraction algorithm of LDA topic model to process and purify the unstructured social listening data to establish a thesaurus for the brand benefit dimensions. The research repetitively performed the LDA algorithm four times using samples of the full data to ensure the thesaurus was complete and 1 600 pieces of data were extracted. The study concluded that the re-emergence of new words had an impact of less than 1. 41% on the brand interest keyword lexicon indicating that the lexicon was largely saturated. The resulting thesaurus included 28 keywords for the expertise dimension 12 for quality 17 for aesthetics 21 for entertainment 24 for social identity 14 for fashionability and 14 for individuality. Lastly the TF-IDF text similarity algorithm was used to calculate the similarity between the thesaurus of each dimension and the full data of social conversations to achieve the measurement of brand equity for the case brand. Innovation in this research are three folds. First the research designed and validated a new approach to measure clothing brand equity which may overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. Second it established a set of indicators of clothing brand equity which can be used for future research. Third it provided a solution to processing unstructured data in natural languages. The results showed that in 2021 consumers were highly concerned of social identity of the case brand its brand equity was influenced by the Xinjiang Cotton event which created tremendous number of conversations about the brand on social networks. In conclusion brand benefits in brand equity which marketers are highly concerned of can be extracted from social listening data. The proposed approach based on social listening data which are often dynamic may overcome the limitations of traditional methods in cost efficiency granularity and measurement sensitivity. In terms of methodology the keyword extraction algorithms such as LDA can be used to construct thesaurus of brand benefit dimensions and text-similarity algorithms can be used to provide quantitative assessment for the dimensions of brand equity. Previous research has shown that carefully planned efforts in enhancing brand equity can significantly improve marketing effectiveness. Emphasizing brand benefits during online shopping festivals or promotional events for instance can create greater consumer engagement with a brand enhance brand image in the minds of consumers and consequently improve consumers' willingness to buy. In future research the algorithms of the proposed approach can be further optimized by applying more cutting-edge machine learning techniques. For instance the algorithm in extraction of keywords and the accuracy of the algorithm for calculating text similarity have room for improvement to achieve more robust measurement of brand equity. © 2022 China Silk Association.

"Accurately predicting the sales trajectory of a product in its life cycle is critically important for firms’ medium- and long-term planning. Because classic product-diffusion models such as the Bass model consider only initial product purchases, they are ill-fitted for sales prediction for today’s technology products with a shorter life cycle and frequent repeat purchases or subscription renewals. Despite the long tradition of product diffusion research, there exists no viable model option when repeat purchases constitute a large proportion of product sales. The present study introduces a new sales growth model, termed the generalized diffusion model with repeat purchases (GDMR), to fill this void. The GDMR formulates the growth rate of sales using a noninteger-order integral equation rather than the integer-order differential equation typically adopted in existing diffusion models. The GDMR is parsimonious and easy to implement. Empirical results show that the GDMR fits sales data with varying proportions of repeat purchases quite well, making it suitable for predicting sales of a wide variety of products. In addition, the GDMR can be extended to incorporate marketing mix variables, thus enhancing its applicability in business decision making. Furthermore, using both real and simulated data, we show that the GDMR can reliably recover a product’s adoption trend using only sales data, thus cementing its theoretical validity and empirical effectiveness. Finally, we show that the GDMR is superior to generic time series and machine learning models in predicting future product sales. 2022 INFORMS.",Lotfi A.; Jiang Z.; Lotfi A.; Jain D.C.,Strategic,10.1287/isre.2022.1131,diffusion of innovations; fractional calculus; multiunit ownerships; repeat purchases; replacements,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the development of a new sales growth model to predict long-term sales trajectories, which aligns with strategic planning aimed at defining organizational goals and adapting to changing market conditions.",scopus-machine learning,60,30,Estimating Life Cycle Sales of Technology Products with Frequent Repeat Purchases: A Fractional Calculus-Based Approach,2023
"Purpose: Two valuable pieces of information – reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings – are accessible to potential customers before they make a purchasing decision. An extensive body of marketing literature has scrutinized the influence of customers’ reviews by linking such aspects as the volume and valance of reviews with product sales and customers’ purchase intention. The aim of this study, for which dual coding theory was used, was to understand the relationship between reviews and their corresponding numerical ratings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the latent Dirichlet allocation technique to categorize customers’ reviews. The present findings contribute to the literature by showing the underlying mechanisms that customers use to interpret reviews and associate them with numerical ratings. Findings: The gradient boosted decision tree model demonstrates that non-abstract-dominant reviews (reviews mainly consist of tangible objects, actions, events or affective words) are significant predictors of their corresponding numerical ratings. However, abstract-dominant reviews (i.e. those consisting primarily of intangible objects, events or actions) cannot predict their associated numerical ratings.

"In this study, we aim to investigate the influence of the time spent reading product information on consumer behavior in e-commerce. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing importance of understanding online consumer behavior, our research focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of customer navigation on e-commerce websites and its effects on purchasing decisions. Recognizing the multidimensional and dynamic nature of consumer behavior, we utilize machine learning techniques, which offer the capacity to handle complex data structures and reveal hidden patterns within the data, thereby augmenting our comprehension of underlying consumer behavior mechanisms. By analyzing clickstream data using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we provide new insights into the internal structure of customer clusters and propose a methodology for analyzing non-linear relationships in datasets. Our results reveal that the time spent reading product-related information, combined with other factors such as bounce rates, exit rates, and customer type, significantly influences a customer’s purchasing decision.

"Purpose: This is the first article to apply a machine learning approach to the analysis of time on market on real estate markets. Design/methodology/approach: The random survival forest approach is introduced to the real estate market. The most important predictors of time on market are revealed and it is analyzed how the survival probability of residential rental apartments responds to these major characteristics. Findings: Results show that price, living area, construction year, year of listing and the distances to the next hairdresser, bakery and city center have the greatest impact on the marketing time of residential apartments. The time on market for an apartment in Munich is lowest at a price of 750 € per month, an area of 60 m2, built in 1985 and is in a range of 200–400 meters from the important amenities. Practical implications: The findings might be interesting for private and institutional investors to derive real estate investment decisions and implications for portfolio management strategies and ultimately to minimize cash-flow failure. Originality/value: Although machine learning algorithms have been applied frequently on the real estate market for the analysis of prices, its application for examining time on market is completely novel.

"Purpose: Online reviews are regarded as a source of information for decision-making because of the abundance and ready availability of information. Whereas, the sheer volume of online reviews makes it hard for consumers, especially the older adults who perceive more difficulties in reading reviews and obtaining information compared to younger adults, to locate the useful ones. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective method to locate valuable reviews of mobile phones for older adults. Besides, the authors also want to explore what characteristics of the technology older adults prefer. This will benefit both e-retailers and e-commerce platforms. Design/methodology/approach: After collecting online reviews related to mobile phones designed for older adults from a popular Chinese e-commerce platform (JD Mall), topic modeling, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) methods were applied to extract latent topics and uncover potential dimensions that consumers frequently referred to in their reviews. According to consumers' attitudes towards different popular topics, seven machine learning models were employed to predict the usefulness and popularity of online reviews due to their excellent performance in prediction. To improve the performance, a weighted model based on the two best-performing models was built and evaluated. Findings: Based on the TF-IDF, topic modeling, and LIWC methods, the authors find that older adults are more interested in the exterior, sound, and communication functions of mobile phones. Besides, the weighted model (Random Forest: Decision Tree = 2:1) is the best model for predicting the online review popularity, while random forest performs best in predicting the perceived usefulness of online reviews. Practical implications: This study’s findings can help e-commerce platforms and merchants identify the needs of the targeted consumers, predict reviews that will get more attention, and provide some early responses to some questions. Originality/value: The results propose that older adults pay more attention to the mobile phones' exterior, sound, and communication function, guiding future research. Besides, this paper also enriches the current studies related to making predictions based on the information contained in the online reviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Shou M.; Bao X.; Yu J.,Tactical,10.1108/ITP-12-2021-0930,E-marketing; Information management; Information society; Online shopping; Quantitative method; Text analysis,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on applying methods to extract and predict the usefulness of online reviews, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.

"In the precision marketing of a new product, it is a challenge to allocate limited resources to the target customer groups with different characteristics. We presented a framework using the distance-based algorithm, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine to capture customers’ preferences toward promotion channels. Additionally, online learning programming was combined with machine learning strategies to fit a dynamic environment, evaluating its performance through a parsimonious model of minimum regret. A resource optimization model was proposed using classification results as input. In particular, we collected data from an institution that provides financial credit products to capital-constrained small businesses. Our sample contained 525,919 customers who will be introduced to a new product. By simulating different scenarios between resources and demand, we showed an up to 22.42% increase in the number of expected borrowers when KNN was performed with an optimal resource allocation strategy. Our results also show that KNN is the most stable method to perform classification and that the distance-based algorithm has the most efficient adoption with online learning. © 2022 by the authors.

"Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon. © 2022 The Authors",Hartmann J.; Heitmann M.; Siebert C.; Schamp C.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.05.005,Deep Contextual Language Models; Machine Learning; Meta-Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Transfer Learning,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the application of sentiment analysis in marketing, focusing on method selection and performance expectations related to specific research questions and data characteristics, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,More than a Feeling: Accuracy and Application of Sentiment Analysis,2023
"The increasing importance of online distribution channels is paralleled by a rising interest in gaining insights into the customer journey and browsing behavior. We evaluate several machine learning methods (latent Dirichlet allocation, correlated topic model, structural topic model, replicated softmax model) with respect to their ability to reproduce the browsing behavior of households across websites. In addition, we compare these machine learning methods to a related classical technique, singular value decomposition. In our study, the replicated softmax model outperforms latent Dirichlet allocation, but the correlated topic model attains the overall best performance. Compared to singular value decomposition both the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model lead to a more efficient compression of web browsing data. On the other hand, singular value decomposition surpasses latent Dirichlet allocation. We interpret results of the correlated topic model and the replicated softmax model by determining combinations of topics or hidden variables that are heterogeneous with respect to visited websites. We show that decision makers should not rely on bivariate measures of site visits, as these do not agree with measures of interdependences between sites that can be inferred from the correlated topic model or the replicated softmax model. We investigate how well topics or hidden variables measured by these methods predict yearly household expenditures. The correlated topic model leads to the best predictive performance, followed by the replicated softmax model. We also discuss how the replicated softmax model can be used to support online marketing decisions of websites. © 2021, The Author(s).",Falke A.; Hruschka H.,Tactical,10.1007/s11573-021-01067-4,Machine learning; Online marketing; Restricted Boltzmann machine; Topic models; Web browsing,5.0,,10,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning methods to analyze customer browsing behavior and predict household expenditures, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"How to promote air traveler repurchasing has become an important marketing strategy in airlines. However, because of the growing concern over user privacy, effectively and accurately delivering advertising to promote repurchasing has become more difficult. Here, we propose an effective framework based on machine learning to model the air traveler repurchasing and furthermore employ a field experiment to test the utility of a model framework. Specifically, we collected that this model framework is based on the random forest algorithm and compared with the conclusions of the other four algorithms, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and ExtraTree algorithms. The results show that the proposed model framework is better than the prediction results of the other algorithms. In addition, the proposed model framework was verified through a real case of an airline in China.

"Recently, author profiling on social media and on online platforms, characterized by a huge volumes of data, has become more than a critical issue. This issue is of increasing interest in various fields related to forensic medicine, security, marketing, education, etc. The main objective of author profiling is to identify the type of writer of the messages, whether it is a human or a bot with a very strong presence. These bots have the task of drawing the attention of browsers to specific events, often used to disseminate incorrect and/or false information. In this work, we offer a new approach to detect these bots and the kind of anonymous perpetrators on these social networks. Our approach, purely statistical, is based on digital features (APSF), extracted from users’ tweets, and on the technique of random forests. A total of 17 stylometry-based features were used to train the model. To assess the performance of our approach, we considered different standard measures, namely accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The results obtained show that our approach gives the best performance for both English and Spanish languages.

"Background: The rapid diffusion of technology apps may support older adults’ independence and improve the quality of their lives. Models for predicting technology acceptance in older adults are sparse, based on broad questions related to general technology acceptance, and largely not grounded in theories of aging. Objective: This study aimed to use a mixed methods approach involving 5 technologies to comprehensively assess the causal relationships among factors that influence older adults’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Methods: In total, 187 men and women aged 65 to 92 years participated in the study. Participants were given presentations on 5 different technologies spanning domains that included transportation, leisure, health, and new learning and provided ratings of each technology on various measures hypothesized to influence adoption. They were also administered other instruments to collect data on their actual and self-assessed cognitive abilities, rates of discounting of the technologies with respect to willingness to invest time to attain higher skills in the technologies, general technology experience, and attitudes toward technology. We used the machine learning technique of k-fold cross-validated regressions to select variables that predicted participants’ willingness to adopt the technologies. Results: Willingness to adopt technologies was most impacted by 3 variables: perceived value of the technologies (β=.54), perceived improvement in quality of life attainable from the technologies (β=.24), and confidence in being able to use the technologies (β=.15). These variables, in turn, were mostly facilitated or inhibited by the perceived effort required to learn to use the technologies, a positive attitude toward technology as reflected in the optimism component of the technology readiness scale, the degree to which technologies were discounted, and the perceived help needed to learn to use the technologies. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that participants’ willingness to adopt technologies is mainly determined by perceptions of 3 aspects of the technologies; these aspects possibly mediate many relationships with willingness to adopt. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design and marketing of technology products for older consumers. ©Jerad Moxley, Joseph Sharit, Sara J Czaja.",Moxley J.; Sharit J.; Czaja S.J.,Out of scope,10.2196/39890,adopt; adoption; aging; application; cognition; cognitive; consumer; design; design; health; independence; learning; leisure; marketing; mobile phone; older adult; relationship; technology; technology; transportation; willingness,0.0,,0,100,JMIR Publications Inc.,"The study focuses on the adoption of technology by older adults, which does not relate to marketing or the marketing applications of AI.",scopus-machine learning,0,0,The Factors Influencing Older Adults’ Decisions Surrounding Adoption of Technology: Quantitative Experimental Study,2022
"Algorithmic systems help manage the governance of digital platforms featuring user-generated content, including how money is distributed to creators from the profits a platform earns from advertising on this content. However, creators producing content about disadvantaged populations have reported that these kinds of systems are biased, having associated their content with prohibited or unsafe content, leading to what creators believed were error-prone decisions to demonetize their videos. Motivated by these reports, we present the results of 20 interviews with YouTube creators and a content analysis of videos, tweets, and news about demonetization cases to understand YouTubers' perceptions of demonetization affecting videos featuring disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, as well as creator responses to demonetization, and what kinds of tools and infrastructure support they desired. We found creators had concerns about YouTube's algorithmic system stereotyping content featuring vulnerable demographics in harmful ways, for example by labeling it ""unsafe'' for children or families - creators believed these demonetization errors led to a range of economic, social, and personal harms. To provide more context to these findings, we analyzed and report on the technique a few creators used to audit YouTube's algorithms to learn what could cause the demonetization of videos featuring LGBTQ people, culture and/or social issues. In response to the varying beliefs about the causes and harms of demonetization errors, we found our interviewees wanted more reliable information and statistics about demonetization cases and errors, more control over their content and advertising, and better economic security.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",Kingsley S.; Sinha P.; Wang C.; Eslami M.; Hong J.I.,Tactical,10.1145/3555149,algorithm auditing; algorithmic systems; algorithms; bias; content creators; creative economy; demonetization; discrimination; economic opportunity; fair pay; future of work; LGBTQ; machine learning systems.; marginalized communities; monetization; precarious work; user auditing; YouTube,5.0,,20,5,Association for Computing Machinery,"The abstract discusses YouTube creators' perceptions and responses to demonetization, highlighting specific desires for better tools and infrastructure, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.

"A strategic market intelligence mechanism is essential for stakeholders to make well-informed decisions on production, pricing, and marketing strategies; however, the complex behaviour of agricultural markets, coupled with the presence of non-stationarity, non-normality, and non-linearity in the arrivals and prices of perishable agricultural commodities pose challenges for traditional statistical models in modelling and forecasting. This study sought to overcome these challenges by employing machine learning and hybrid models for vegetable crops. Machine learning techniques, known for their flexibility with non-stationary, non-normal, and non-linear data, were showcased in the empirical illustration, highlighting their effectiveness. The trends of arrivals and prices were found to be significantly positive (p<0.01) for tomato and capsicum. Time delay neural network (TDNN) and hybrid models outperformed the seasonal ARIMA models based on lower RMSE and MAPE for the modelling and forecasting. Utilizing the best-fit models, the prices of tomato and capsicum were forecasted to be highest during June 2024 with ₹2267 and 2623 per q.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the concept of distrust of traditional banking institutions as a factor that can explain the choice to remain unbanked in a marketplace that is designed to be financially inclusive. Design/methodology/approach: Earning, spending, saving and borrowing data collected between May 2021 and February 2022 from 17,819 consumers living in the United States were used to examine the factors associated with distrust of banks. Using a conceptual framework borrowed from the health services profession, the study was conducted in two stages. At the first stage, distrust among the unbanked and banked was estimated using a Boruta-random forest algorithm. At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis. Findings: Results from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked. Research limitations/implications: This study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field.

"Creativity, ideas, and an entrepreneurial attitude are needed to innovate. However, it is also necessary to have practical instruments that allow innovations to be reflected in the company. One of those tools is technology. This research aims to analyze innovation and technology in the tequila industry through Bayesian networks with machine learning techniques. Likewise, an innovation and technology management model will be developed to make better decisions, which will allow the company to innovate to generate competitive advantages in a mature low-tech industry. A model is made in which the critical factors that influence management innovation and technology optimally to generate value translate into competitive advantages. The evidence shows that the optimal or non-optimal management of knowledge management and its various factors, through the causality of the variables, allow the interrelation to be more adequately captured to manage it. The results show that the most relevant factors for adequate management of innovation and technology are knowledge management, sales and marketing, organizational and technological architecture, national and international markets, cultivation of raw materials, agave, and management, use of waste, and not research and development. © 2022 by the authors.

"An overwhelming majority of previous works find longer product reviews to be more helpful than short reviews. In this paper, we build upon information overload theory and propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the complexity of the line of argumentation. To test this idea, we implement state-of-the-art machine learning methods that allow us to study the line of argumentation in reviews at the sentence-level. Our empirical analysis based on a dataset of Amazon customer reviews suggests that line of argumentation and review length are closely intertwined such that longer reviews with frequent changes between positive and negative arguments are perceived as less helpful. Our work has important implications for marketing professionals and retailer platforms that can utilize our results to optimize their customer feedback systems, enhance reviewer guidelines, and include more useful product reviews. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Lutz B.; Pröllochs N.; Neumann D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.02.010,Argumentation patterns; Consumer reviews; Data-driven decision-making; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Online word-of-mouth,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the analysis of product reviews and their perceived helpfulness, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Modern call centers require precise forecasts of call and e-mail arrivals to optimize staffing decisions and to ensure high customer satisfaction through short waiting times and the availability of qualified agents. In the dynamic environment of multi-channel customer contact, organizational decision-makers often rely on robust but simplistic forecasting methods. Although forecasting literature indicates that incorporating additional information into time series predictions adds value by improving model performance, extant research in the call center domain barely considers the potential of sophisticated multivariate models. Hence, with an extended dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) approach, this study proposes a new reliable method for call center arrivals’ forecasting that is able to capture the dynamics of a time series and to include contextual information in form of predictor variables. The study evaluates the predictive potential of the approach on the call and e-mail arrival series of a leading German online retailer comprising 174 weeks of data. The analysis involves time series cross-validation with an expanding rolling window over 52 weeks and comprises established time series as well as machine learning models as benchmarks. The multivariate DHR model outperforms the compared models with regard to forecast accuracy for a broad spectrum of lead times. This study further gives contextual insights into the selection and optimal implementation of marketing-relevant predictor variables such as catalog releases, mail as well as postal reminders, or billing cycles. © 2021, The Author(s).",Rausch T.M.; Albrecht T.; Baier D.,Tactical,10.1007/s11573-021-01075-4,Call center arrivals; Customer relationship management; Dynamic harmonic regression; Forecasting; Machine learning; Time series analysis,5.0,,15,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a forecasting method for call and email arrivals in call centers, which is aimed at optimizing staffing decisions and directly relates to structured decision-making processes within an organization.

"In the current digital era, the humongous amount of data being generated has been impacting public lives in one or the other ways. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is related to contextual mining of texts which helps in identification and extraction of subjective information from the source material. Sentiment analysis is being used for brand monitoring and reputation management across different market segments. It helps to understand how the public perceive a particular brand, product or service that is highly useful for different tech companies, marketing agencies, media organizations, fashion brands etc. In today’s scenario we have been suffering with data overload which makes it impossible to analyze public sentiments without any sort of error or bias. Sentiment analysis provides better insights into the public reviews as it can be automated which ultimately helps in decision making. There are various deep learning and machine learning methods and models as well as natural language processing tools which help in examining and analyzing public opinions with low time complexity. However, deep learning methods have become highly popular in recent times as these models provide high efficiency and accuracy. In this review paper we have provided a complete overview of the common deep learning frameworks being employed for sentiment classification and analysis. This paper discusses various learning models, evaluation, text representations and other metrics in deep learning architectures. The key findings of different authors have been discussed in detail.

"According to the World Health Organization, vaccine hesitancy was one of the ten major threats to global health in 2019, including the COVID-19 vaccine. The availability of vaccines does not always mean utilization. This is because, people have less confidence in vaccines, which resulted in vaccination hesitancy and developing global decline in vaccine intake and has caused viral disease outbreaks worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to understand people’s perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine to help the manufacturing companies of the vaccine to improve their marketing strategy based on the rejection causes. In this paper, we used multi-class Sentiment Analysis to classify people’s opinions from extracted tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, using firstly different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and secondly various Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNN-LSTM and RNN-GRU. Then, we investigated the analysis of the negative tweets to identify the causes of rejection using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Finally, we classified these negative tweets according to the rejection causes for all the vaccines using the same selected ML and DL models. The result of SA showed that DT gives the best performance with an accuracy of 92.26% and for DL models, GRU achieved 96.83%. Then, we identified five causes: Lack of safety, Side effect, Production problem, Fake news and Misinformation, and Cost. Furthermore, for the classification of the negative tweets according to the identified rejection causes, the LR achieved the best result with an accuracy of 89.97%. For DL models, the LSTM model showed the best result with an accuracy of 91.66%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Alotaibi W.; Alomary F.; Mokni R.,Tactical,10.1007/s13278-023-01059-y,COVID-19 vaccines; Deep learning; GRU-LSTM; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine rejection causes,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the analysis of public sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine, focusing on identifying causes of vaccine hesitancy and improving marketing strategies based on these insights.

"Social networks have become important objects of study in recent years. Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training. © 2023 by the authors.",Michelessa M.; Hurter C.; Lim B.Y.; Ling J.N.S.; Cautis B.; Hargreaves C.A.,Tactical,10.3390/bdcc7030149,decision-focused learning; differentiable greedy; edge bundling; end-to-end learning; graph visualization; influence maximization,5.0,,15,0,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses the development of an end-to-end learning model (SGREEDYNN) for the selection of influential nodes in social networks, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on specific marketing strategies, data visualization, and user engagement.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Visual Explanations of Differentiable Greedy Model Predictions on the Influence Maximization Problem,2023
"The appropriate management of home medical waste is of paramount importance due to the adverse consequences that arise from improper handling. Incorrect disposal practices can lead to pharmacopollution, which poses significant risks to environmental integrity and human well-being. Involving medicine users in waste management empowers them to take responsibility for their waste and make informed decisions to safeguard the environment and public health. The objective of this research was to contribute to the prevention of pharmacopollution by identifying influential factors that promote responsible disposal practices among medicine users. Factors such as attitude, marketing campaigns, collection points, safe handling, medical prescription, package contents, and public policies and laws were examined. To analyze the complex relationships and interactions among these factors, a dual-staged approach was employed, utilizing advanced statistical modeling techniques and deep learning artificial neural network algorithms. Data were collected from 952 respondents in Pernambuco, a state in northeastern Brazil known for high rates of pharmacopollution resulting from improper disposal of household medical waste. The results of the study indicated that the propositions related to safety in handling and medical prescription were statistically rejected in the structural equation modeling (SEM) model. However, in the artificial neural network (ANN) model, these two propositions were found to be important predictors of cooperative behavior, highlighting the ANN’s ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between variables.

"Research has long debated the effectiveness of socio-demographics in understanding purchase behavior, with mixed conclusions. The appeal of socio-demographic data for customer relationship marketing is based on its low acquisition cost and the growing array of variables on which marketers can condition messages and offers. We reinvestigate the value of socio-demographic variables, focusing on the potential of machine learning procedures (MLPs) to extract a stronger and reliable signal than the standard linear-in-parameters (logistic) regression models. We explore how predictive power can be increased through the nonlinearities and interactions identified with MLPs; our experimental set ranges from well-established procedures to newer entrants in this space. We also examine causality vis-à-vis predictability using a propensity scoring approach. Empirics are based on six grocery product categories and more than 7,000 panelists.

"Purpose: A good decision support system for credit scoring enables telecom operators to measure the subscribers' creditworthiness in a fine-grained manner. This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint).

"Purpose: This study aims to examine the technical efficiency of the chemical-free farming system in India using a hybrid combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the efficiency scores of decision-making units’ efficiency (DMUs) are obtained using an input-oriented DEA model under the assumption of a variable return to scale. Based on these scores, the DMUs are classified into efficient and inefficient categories. The 2nd stage of analysis involves the identification of the most important predictors of efficiency using a random forest model and a generalized logistic regression model. Findings: The results show that by using their resources efficiently, growers can reduce their inputs by 34 percent without affecting the output. Orchard's size, the proportion of land, grower's age, orchard's age and family labor are the most important determinants of efficiency. Besides, growers' main occupation and footfall of intermediaries at the farm gate also demonstrate significant influence on efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The study used only one output and a limited set of input variables. Incorporating additional variables or dimensions like fertility of the land, climatic conditions, altitude of the land, output quality (size/taste/appearance) and per acre profitability could yield more robust results. Although pineapple is cultivated in all eight northeastern states, the data for the study has been collected from only two states. The production and marketing practices followed by the growers in the remaining six northeastern states and other parts of the country might be different. As the growers do not maintain farm records, their data might suffer from selective retrieval bias. Practical implications: Given the rising demand for organic food, improving the efficiency of chemical-free growers will be a win-win situation for both growers and consumers. The results will aid policymakers in bringing necessary interventions to make chemical-free farming more remunerative for the growers. The business managers can act as a bridge to connect these remote growers with the market by sharing customer feedback and global best practices. Social implications: Although many developments have happened to the DEA technique, the present study used a traditional form of DEA. Therefore, future research should combine ML techniques with more advanced versions like bootstrap and fuzzy DEA. Upcoming research should include more input and output variables to predict the efficiency of the chemical-free farming system. For instance, environmental variables, like climatic conditions, degree of competition, government support and consumers' attitude towards chemical-free food, can be examined along with farm and grower-specific variables. Future studies should also incorporate chemical-free growers from a wider geographic area. Lastly, future studies can also undertake a longitudinal estimation of efficiency and its determinants for the chemical-free farming system.

"Photographs with a human element are powerful in influencing viewers' perceptions and decision-making processes. However, rare quantitative evidence was detected about the best human presenting percentage and how it affects the intention. In this study, we decoded how human elements (presence or absence, low or high proportion) affect viewers' perceptions and intentions in nature/culture-based photographs. Innovatively, three deep learning models and two experiments were integrated. The results indicate that (1) in general, maintaining the proportion of human elements at less than 1% leads to the best positive perception, and (2) the viewers demonstrate different perceptions and intentions in viewing nature-based and culture-based photographs with the human element.

This study addresses this imperative by conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews on smartwatches, aiming to determine the pivotal factors guiding consumer purchasing decisions. By employing word clouds to visually represent sentiments, the study uncovers notable trends. Positive reviews prominently highlight the term “quality”, suggesting a strong emphasis on product excellence. In contrast, negative reviews were characterized by the prevalence of the term “fake”, indicating concerns related to authenticity. Additionally, a comparative assessment of two machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines and Naive Bayes, demonstrates that support vector machines exhibit superior accuracy in classification. These findings offer valuable insights for industry practitioners navigating the competitive landscape of the smartwatch market, providing actionable information for optimizing product features and refining marketing strategies to meet consumer expectations. © 2024 by the author(s).

"We estimate the causal effects of different targeted email promotions on the opening and purchase decisions of the consumerswho receive them. To do so,we synthesize and extend recent advances in causal machine learning techniques to capture heterogeneity in the content of the email subject line itself as well as heterogeneous consumer responses to the promotional offers and semantic choices contained therein. We find that content and framing are important for driving performance. We identify precise causal estimates of the effects of individual deal components, personalized content, and various semantic choices on consumer outcomes all theway down the conversion funnel. The decompositional nature of our methodology allows us to show how different combinations of key words and promotional inducements produce significantly different outcomes, both within a given stage and across all stages of the funnel. Notably, discounts framed as clearance events sharply outperform those tied to particular products. We also find components that drive engagement at the top of the funnel don’t always lead to conversion at the bottom: their efficacy, across the funnel, is significantly moderated by the engagement levels of the consumers who receive them. Finally, leveraging both aspects of heterogeneity,we use off-policy evaluation to demonstrate the potential for significant gains fromimproved targeting. © 2023, INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

"It is complex to explain how sustainable tourism indicators are incorporated in the governance structures of destination marketing/management organisations (DMMOs) to inform policymaking. This paper develops realist evaluation methods to explain under which conditions four European DMMOs adopt a relevant group of indicators (acquisition), to provide meaning to these indicators (assimilation), which creates the conditions to make indicator-informed decisions (transformation) that can eventually generate benefits attributable to the use of indicators (exploitation). The methodological novelty of this paper is the use of outcome mapping to systematically outline the process of data collection and analysis to reach the context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining the factors that facilitate or impede the absorptive capacity in these DMMOs.

"Purpose: In a volatile agricultural postharvest market, producers require more personalized information about market dynamics for informed decisions on the marketed surplus. However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Tripathi P.K.; Singh C.K.; Singh R.; Deshmukh A.K.,Strategic,10.1108/BIJ-12-2021-0780,Agricultural decision support system; Agricultural supply chain; Market intelligence system; Optimal marketing strategy; Predictive modelling; Risk management,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses designing an Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) aimed at long-term strategic planning for crop producers facing volatile postharvest markets.

"Social Customer Relationship Management (social CRM) has become one of the central points for many companies seeking to improve their customer experience. It comprises a set of processes that allows decision-makers to analyze customer data, in order to launch an efficient, customer-centric, and cost-effective marketing strategy. Nonetheless, the inclusion of social media data in CRM introduces new challenges, as it requires advanced analytical approaches to extract actionable insight from such a huge amount of data. Thus, in this paper, we propose a social CRM analytic framework, which includes various analytical approaches, aiming at improving customer retention, acquisition, and conversion. This framework has been tested on various datasets and extensively evaluated based on several performance metrics. The obtained results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively extract relevant information and support decision-making processes. From an academics perspective, the study contributes to an understanding of customers’ experiences throughout their engagement on social media and focuses on long-term relationships with customers. From a managerial perspective, companies should leverage the insight generated through every customer engagement on social media to drive effective marketing strategies. © 2021",Lamrhari S.; Ghazi H.E.; Oubrich M.; Faker A.E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121275,Acquisition; Conversion; Customer retention; Customer satisfaction; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social CRM; Social media,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a social CRM analytic framework aimed at improving customer retention, acquisition, and conversion.

"Sentiment analysis has demonstrated its value in a range of high-stakes domains. From financial markets to supply chain management, logistics, and technology legitimacy assessment, sentiment analysis offers insights into public sentiment, actionable data, and improved decision forecasting. This study contributes to this growing body of research by offering a novel multi-view deep learning approach to sentiment analysis that incorporates non-textual features like emojis. The proposed approach considers both textual and emoji views as distinct views of emotional information for the sentiment classification model, and the results acknowledge their individual and combined contributions to sentiment analysis. Comparative analysis with baseline classifiers reveals that incorporating emoji features significantly enriches sentiment analysis, enhancing the accuracy, F1-score, and execution time of the proposed model. Additionally, this study employs LIME for explainable sentiment analysis to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enabling high-stakes businesses to understand the factors driving customer sentiment. The present study contributes to the literature on multi-view text classification in the context of social media and provides an innovative analytics method for businesses to extract valuable emotional information from electronic word of mouth (eWOM), which can help them stay ahead of the competition in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In addition, the findings of this paper have important implications for policy development in digital communication and social media monitoring.

"This article introduces algorithmic bias in machine learning (ML) based marketing models. Although the dramatic growth of algorithmic decision making continues to gain momentum in marketing, research in this stream is still inadequate despite the devastating, asymmetric and oppressive impacts of algorithmic bias on various customer groups. To fill this void, this study presents a framework identifying the sources of algorithmic bias in marketing, drawing on the microfoundations of dynamic capability. Using a systematic literature review and in-depth interviews of ML professionals, the findings of the study show three primary dimensions (i.e., design bias, contextual bias and application bias) and ten corresponding subdimensions (model, data, method, cultural, social, personal, product, price, place and promotion).

"This paper reviews the research literature on forecasting retail demand. We begin by introducing the forecasting problems that retailers face, from the strategic to the operational, as sales are aggregated over products to stores and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches.

"This paper addresses the use of a customer character model as a determinant of used auto loan churn among a unique population of subprime borrowers. The customer character model (i.e restricted model) is compared to a full model consisting of the 4 Cs of capacity, collateral, credit, and character of churn prediction. The results reveal that there is a difference between the full model and the customer character model. Additionally, different supervised classification methods, such as logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision trees (DTs), and random forests (RFs), are applied and compared in terms of multiple predictive performance measures. The RF classification measures report the strongest performance. Additionally, different classification methods suggest the importance of different customer character variables. Therefore, from a practical perspective, effective borrower character screening is recommended to determine customer profiles more accurately for the purposes of target marketing and customer retention. This study also deepens understanding of subprime credit markets and reveals additional insights to credit screening using machine learning techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Valluri C.; Raju S.; Patil V.H.,Tactical,10.1057/s41270-021-00135-6,4 Cs; Auto loans; Churn; Classification techniques; Credit screening; Machine learning; Subprime; Supervised learning,5.0,,15,0,Palgrave Macmillan,"The abstract discusses the application of various supervised classification methods to predict used auto loan churn among subprime borrowers.

"Emotion detection is a promising field of research in multiple perspectives such as psychology, marketing, network analysis and so on. Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Bhattacharya S.; Agarwala A.; Roy S.,Tactical,10.1007/s13278-022-00957-x,COVID Twitter data; Machine learning; Mood detection; Mood prediction,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the development and comparison of mood detection models, which aligns with tactical decision-making in optimizing and analyzing marketing strategies, specifically in the context of sentiment analysis and user engagement through text data.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Mood detection and prediction using conventional machine learning techniques on COVID19 data,2022
"Crop type classification is an essential task in agriculture that has been studied widely since the emergence of remote sensing technologies. Accurate crop mapping can help assist decision-making related to storage, marketing, and other production tasks. This study has designed robust crop classification models to classify two major crop types (cereals and canola) in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. These models combined Sentinel 1 and 2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Three methods were applied to test classification quality: the holdout method, leave-one-season-out cross-validation (LOSOCV), and leave-one-cluster-out-cross-validation (LOCOCV). The holdout method evaluated the model's performance on data representing the entire population. The LOSOCV method was used to test the model's ability to extrapolate over time (unseen data from new seasons), and the LOCOCV method was used to test the ability to extrapolate over space (data from a new site). Crop type labelled data (n = 193 for cereals and n = 113 for canola) were extracted from high-resolution yield maps derived from grain yield monitors mounted on harvesters, and this was used to train and validate the classification models. The results showed that the holdout validation approach achieved the highest accuracy (overall and Kappa scores >0.98), but this might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the sampling strategy implemented, which leads to an overoptimistic scenario. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores achieved from the LOSOCV method varied depending upon the difference in crop phenology from season to season, with overall accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 0.92 and Kappa scores from 0.61 to 0.90. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores for the LOCOCV ranged from 0.87 to 0.99 and 0.84 to 0.98, respectively. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and the chlorophyll red edge index (CIr) were the most important features across the three models. The outputs of this research can potentially complement models that require crop type information, such as carbon cycling and crop yield models. © 2024 The Authors",Al-Shammari D.; Fuentes I.; Whelan B.M.; Wang C.; Filippi P.; Bishop T.F.A.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101200,Gross primary productivity; Machine learning; Optical remote sensing; Radar; Yield monitor data,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses crop type classification using remote sensing technologies in agriculture, which does not relate to marketing or business strategy.",scopus-machine learning,0,0,"Combining Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 and MODIS data for major winter crop type classification over the Murray Darling Basin in Australia",2024
"The nature of people's web navigation has significantly changed in recent years. The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",De Smedt J.; Lacka E.; Nita S.; Kohls H.-H.; Paton R.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113579,Sequence mining; Session fingerprinting; Session stitching; Web analytics,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses a method of linking web sessions to specific users through machine learning, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on implementing strategies to improve marketing outcomes, such as customer analysis and session stitching.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Session stitching using sequence fingerprinting for web page visits,2021
"Given the pervasive ubiquity of data, sales practice is moving rapidly into an era of predictive analytics, using quantitative methods, including machine learning algorithms, to reveal unknown information, such as customers’ personality, value, or churn probabilities. However, many sales organizations face difficulties when implementing predictive analytics applications. This article elucidates these difficulties by developing the PSAA model—a conceptual framework that explains how predictive sales analytics (PSA) applications support sales employees’ job performance. In particular, the PSAA model conceptualizes the key contingencies governing how the availability of PSA applications translates into adoption of these applications and, ultimately, job performance. These contingencies determine the extent to which sales employees adopt these applications to revise their decision-making and the extent to which these updates improve the decision outcome. To build the PSAA model, we integrate literature on predictive analytics and machine learning, technology adoption, and marketing capabilities. In doing so, this research provides a theoretical frame for future studies on salesperson adoption and effective utilization of PSA. © 2023, The Author(s).",Habel J.; Alavi S.; Heinitz N.,Strategic,10.1007/s13162-022-00252-0,Advanced analytics; Machine learning; Personal selling; Predictive analytics; Sales force effectiveness; Sales management,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the development of a conceptual framework (PSAA model) that addresses long-term goals related to the adoption of predictive analytics in sales organizations.

"Purpose: The rapid development of e-commerce has brought not only great convenience to people but a great challenge to online stores. Phenomenon such as out of stock and slow sales has been common in recent years. These issues can be managed only when the occurrence of the sales volume is predicted in advance, and sufficient warnings can be executed in time. Thus, keeping in mind the importance of the sales prediction system, the purpose of this paper is to propose an effective sales prediction model and make digital marketing strategies with the machine learning model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the consumer purchasing behavior decision theory, we discuss the factors affecting product sales, including external factors, consumer perception, consumer potential purchase behavior and consumer traffic. Then we propose a sales prediction model, M-GNA-XGBOOST, using the time-series prediction that ensures the effective prediction of sales about each product in a short time on online stores based on the sales data in the previous term or month or year. The proposed M-GNA-XGBOOST model serves as an adaptive prediction model, for which the instant factors and the sales data of the previous period are the input, and the optimal computation is based on the proposed methodology. The adaptive prediction using the proposed model is developed based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The model inherits the advantages among the algorithms with better accuracy and forecasts the sales of each product in the store with instant data characteristics for the first time. Findings: The analysis using Jingdong dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is enhanced and the accuracy that instant data as input is found to be better compared with the model that lagged data as input. The root means squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed model are found to be around 11.9 and 8.23. According to the sales prediction of each product, the resource can be arranged in advance, and the marketing strategy of product positioning, product display optimization, inventory management and product promotion is designed for online stores.

"Purpose – This paper explores various supervised machine learning algorithms as an additional classification method to RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) models with the aim of improving the accuracy in predicting target groups of customers for direct marketing response campaigns conducted by a casino. The purpose of this paper is twofold – first, to test how the addition of demographic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach – Our research employed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino’s direct marketing activities to improve the company’s RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications – The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company’s own RFM segmentation was also found to perform well. Limitations – Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models’ power. While all models developed are applicable to similar data, they could lose their accuracy when applied to data from a different industry. The company’s own RFM model was not analyzed but was included in the model as is. Further insight could be gained by determining its optimal pa-rameters. Originality – This study contributes to the existing litera-ture by showing how direct marketing efficiency modeling using standard RFM could be improved with the addition of a company’s customer property. It also provides insight into how classification algorithms perform on a casino database of direct marketing activities. © 2023, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

"The demand for urban delivery services (UDS) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been growing due to the spike in e-commerce activities. This phenomenon has led to the search for more innovative UDS modes, such as drones, as they provide fast, safer, and eco-friendly services. Although researchers have examined the perceptions regarding the adoption of drone delivery, there are many unknowns about the intentions to use this futuristic delivery mode. By employing survey data obtained through an online survey conducted in Ghana, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the current UDS user profiles and investigate their intentions to adopt drone deliveries in the future, considering the lived experiences of traditional UDS usage pre/post the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding UDS user profiling, the study applied an advanced unsupervised machine learning method known as cluster correspondence analysis to simultaneously identify critical clusters in the data as well as key factor associations for each group. The findings demonstrated that most people in Ghana who seldom used the traditional UDS usually experienced poor service levels. Females living in the capital of Ghana who are frequent users of UDS mainly experienced acceptable service levels. Using an ordered probit regression model, the study identified that variables such as males, people who desired contactless UDS, and frequent UDS users at work or school during the COVID-19 pandemic were more inclined to embrace drone deliveries when introduced. Conversely, individuals who frequently used UDS services at home, those living in large cities, and those with lower income levels expressed reluctance toward drone delivery services. This study augments the urban logistics literature in LMICs by offering insightful suggestions in the areas of education, enhanced marketing strategies, and delivery optimization, which are instrumental for informing policy decisions. Government-related transportation bodies, private logistics firms, and trade unions can collaborate and adopt the recommendations provided to improve urban delivery services and to pave the way for integrating drone delivery services in the near future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Tamakloe R.; Zhang K.; Atandzi J.; Park D.,Strategic,10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.12.004,COVID-19; Drone deliveries; Low- and middle-income country; Machine learning; Probit; Urban logistics,10.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract focuses on the long-term implications of adopting drone delivery services in urban delivery systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

"Optimal stopping is the problem of deciding when to stop a stochastic system to obtain the greatest reward, arising in numerous application areas such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy’s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Poor’s 500 Index data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art noninterpretable methods, based on simulation regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure. © 2020 INFORMS",Ciocan D.F.; Mišić V.V.,Out of scope,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3592,approximate dynamic programming; decision trees; interpretability; optimal stopping; option pricing,5.0,,5,75,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses optimal stopping in stochastic systems, particularly in finance (option pricing), which falls outside the marketing-related applications specified in the definitions.",scopus-machine learning,10,5,Interpretable Optimal Stopping,2022
"This paper examines the applications of copyright protection standards to the creation and utilisation of databases for machine learning purposes and compares the law from Malaysia, Taiwan and the European Union. The current international regime for copyright protection of databases requires that compilations of data be protected “by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents [which] constitute intellectual creations"". However, Malaysia continues to follow the sweat of the brow approach to copyright protection of tables or compilations although a provision similar to TRIPS separately exists. On the other hand, Taiwan adopts a similar, but not identical approach to the TRIPS. The key differences are that Taiwan’s formulation uses the word “creativity” instead of “creation” sans“intellectual” and uses the conjunction “and” instead of “or” between selection and arrangement. The ECJ’s decision in Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo! UK Ltd in interpreting the European Database Directive emphasised that copyright protection for databases must be determined solely on the basis of the selection or arrangement but not on the creation of content. Likewise, the Fixture Marketing cases decided by the ECJ held that only the obtaining, verification or presentation of “existing independent material” matters to the sui generis database rights but not that of newly created data. It would appear that most, if not all, machine learning datasets will not satisfy the “intellectual creations” requirement and thus fail to qualify for copyright protection. Enacting a universal sui generis database protection may not be an easy solution. Perhaps, it is time for the international community to get down from the philosophical high horse and to accept that databases should be protected in copyright simply on account of the effort in their compilation, without the necessity to judge whether there is any intellectual input in the selection or arrangement of their content. © 2021",Khong D.W.K.; Yeh W.-J.,Out of scope,,Copyright Protection of Databases; European Database Directive; Machine Learning Datasets; Malaysia; Taiwan,0.0,,5,85,National Taipei University of Technology,"The abstract discusses copyright protection standards in relation to databases for machine learning, which does not directly relate to marketing applications.",scopus-machine learning,5,5,The Problem of Copyright Protection for Machine Learning Databases: A Comparative Study,2021
"Due to the tremendous expansion of Chinese outbound travel market, it is of great significance to identify the characteristics of potential Chinese outbound tourists so as to develop targeted marketing strategies. As both extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of individuals are important in influencing their decision-making process, this study explores potential Chinese outbound tourists from these two aspects. Demographic and psychographic factors, as the proxy of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics, respectively, are incorporated into this study to construct the relationship between tourists' characteristics and their intentions of outbound travel. An advanced machine learning approach, called twice-learning, is employed for modelling in this study. As an intelligent data analysis tool, this method is able to construct models that can provide insight into the ground-truth relationships hidden beneath the data in an essentially comprehensible way, without being limited by the typical assumptions held by the traditional data analysis methods. By applying this method, the important personal factors that influence Chinese citizens' intentions of outbound travel are detected, and the typical groups of potential Chinese outbound tourists are characterised. The findings would be beneficial for destination marketers to develop marketing strategies on positioning and advertising which are tailored to potential Chinese outbound travel market. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Zhang C.; Zhang J.,Tactical,10.1080/13683500.2013.768606,machine learning; outbound travel; personal characteristic; travel intention; twice-learning,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on identifying characteristics of potential Chinese outbound tourists to develop targeted marketing strategies.

"It is challenging to forecast total sales of short life-cycle products due to a lack of historical sales data. Multi-source information combination methods make it possible to depict different kinds of characteristics and features, given a limited volume of samples. Evidence theory is a common approach used for multi-source combinations. This paper proposes a new method, named ‘Multi-Evidence Dynamic Weighted Combination Forecasting (MEDWCF)’, based on improvements in the application of Evidence theory. Two kinds of machine learning methods are used to solve the basic probability assignment generation problem pertaining to Evidence theory, so a dynamic update combination algorithm is proposed. These innovations improve the classical one-step static combination rules. Samples of 313 films launched within 2016 and 2017 proved that compared with other forecasting methods, MEDWCF has more effectiveness and better generalisation ability.

"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known “learn-and-earn” trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser’s MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel. © 2017 INFORMS.",Schwartz E.M.; Bradlow E.T.; Fader P.S.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.1023,A/B testing; Adaptive experiments; Earning-and-learning; Explore-exploit; Field experiments; Hierarchical models; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandit; Online advertising; Reinforcement learning; Sequential decision making,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the implementation of multi-armed bandit methods for online advertising campaigns, focusing on optimizing ad impressions and customer acquisition rates, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Customer acquisition via display advertising using multi-armed bandit experiments,2017
"Cookie stuffing is an activity which allows unscrupulous actors online to defraud affiliate marketing programs by causing themselves to receive credit for purchases made by web users, even if the affiliate marketer did not actively perform any marketing for the affiliate program. Using 2 months of HTTP request logs from a large public university, we present an empirical study of fraud in affiliate marketing programs. First, we develop an efficient, decision-tree based technique for detecting cookie-stuffing in HTTP request logs. Our technique replicates domain-informed human labeling of the same data with 93.3% accuracy. Second, we find that over one-third of publishers in affiliate marketing programs use fraudulent cookie-stuffing techniques in an attempt to claim credit from online retailers for illicit referrals.

"Purpose: Predicting customers’ purchase behaviors is a challenging task. The literature has introduced the individual-level and the segment-based predictive modeling approaches for this purpose. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and performs in certain cases. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach which predicts customers’ individual purchase behaviors and reduces the limitations of these two methods by combining the advantages of them. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hybrid approach is established based on individual-level and segment-based approaches and utilizes the historical transactional data and predictive algorithms to generate predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in the domain of supermarket shopping by using real-world data and using five popular machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests. Findings: A comparison of results shows that the proposed hybrid approach substantially outperforms the individual-level and the segment-based approaches in terms of prediction coverage while maintaining roughly comparable prediction accuracy to the individual-level method. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that logistic regression performs better than the other classifiers in predicting customer purchase behavior. Practical implications: The study concludes that the proposed approach would be beneficial for enterprises in terms of designing customized services and one-to-one marketing strategies.

"Identifying the determinants of firms' investment in knowledge, this study first explores the heterogeneous impacts of research and development (R&D) on product, process, organization, and marketing innovation. Second, it examines if there exists a complementary (substitute) relation in terms of firms' preference between four types of innovation. Studying 1500 firms of seven developing economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a machine learning-based regression, to identify key predictors likely to influence firms' R&D propensity and intensity. Estimating the knowledge function, we found-in line with LASSO-that medium-sized firms, human capital (training) and credit facilities favorably affect firms' decision to invest in R&D. Contrarily, the impact is adverse if the first or main product generates firms' large share of revenue, a unique finding not captured by previous studies. The marginal effects of four univariate probit models indicate that firms' investment in R&D translates into innovation. However, the application of the Geweke-Hajivassiliour-Keane (GHK)-simulator based multivariate probit, which considers simultaneity of firms' innovation decisions that univariate probit ignores, suggests that the relationship between different types of innovation is complementary. Firms' strategy to adopt a particular type of innovation is influenced by other types. This led to the estimation of R&D's impact on technological and nontechnological innovation, which shows that while firms innovate both types, there is a skewed link between nontechnological innovation and the services sector. © 2020 by the author.",Zhang J.; Islam M.S.,Strategic,10.3390/su12041643,LASSO; Multivariate probit; Nontechnological innovation; R & D; Technological innovation; Tobit,5.0,,10,5,MDPI,"The abstract discusses the determinants of firms' investment in R&D and their implications for various types of innovation, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and defining organizational goals.",scopus-machine learning,60,20,The heterogeneous impacts of R&D on innovation in services sector: A firm-level study of developing ASEAN,2020

"Today's Internet marketing ecosystems are very complex, with many competing players, transactions concluded within milliseconds, and hundreds of different parameters to be analyzed in the decision-making process. In addition, both sellers and buyers operate under uncertainty, without full information about auction results, purchasing preferences, and strategies of their competitors or suppliers. As a result, most market participants strive to optimize their trading strategies using advanced machine learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a new approach to determining reserve-price strategies for publishers, focusing not only on the profits from individual ad impressions, but also on maximum coverage of advertising space. This strategy combines the heuristics developed by experienced RTB consultants with machine learning forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet.

"In the industry of video content providers such as VOD and IPTV, predicting the popularity of video contents in advance is critical, not only for marketing but also for network usage. By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts.

"Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Ahani A.; Nilashi M.; Yadegaridehkordi E.; Sanzogni L.; Tarik A.R.; Knox K.; Samad S.; Ibrahim O.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.06.014,Canary islands; Customer satisfaction; Hotel; Machine learning; Market segmentation; Multi-criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preferences analysis,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research focuses on interpreting customer satisfaction and preferences derived from online reviews to inform hotel managers' marketing strategies.

"Grape yield prediction is an important tool used by growers to optimize vineyard management and obtain better income. In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Arab S.T.; Noguchi R.; Matsushita S.; Ahamed T.,Not identified,10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100485,LAI; Machine learning; NDVI; NDWI; Satellite remote sensing; Vineyard yield,10.0,,10,60,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses grape yield prediction using machine learning and satellite imagery, which does not clearly align with strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decision-making as defined.

"The impact of the development of the internet and new communications channels on the marketing industry pushed practitioners to devise new tools and approaches for influencing consumer attitudes and behaviors towards products and services. This has led to new insights into persuasive message design. In general, persuasive advertisement messaging can be viewed as a combination of context, i.e., a message, and additional affiliated components such as images, video, and special graphics. It is composed out of two main attribute categorizations: (1) textual content such as a product description or affiliated message and (2) sensible content such as product image, color, or even scent. In a competitive market in which consumers are constantly exposed to a hyper-abundance of products that also contain sensible attributes, it is crucial to design persuasive messages that will maximally appeal to desired consumers and evoke their positive response. Yet only a few studies have focused on the effective design of persuasive advertisement messages characterized by two integrated elements. As such, this research focuses on effective persuasive message design with integrated product scent and color attributes. We demonstrate how a machine learning process can be utilized to generate optimal persuasive messages by estimating the contribution of each message attribute to the final class attribute: the purchase intention response. Our results show that several prediction algorithms can enhance consumer response value. In addition, correlations between several attributes affiliated with the message can be derived by graph theory-based estimation. This research thus provides insight into attribute values important for management decisions, with implications for effective persuasive message design. Ultimately, this may lead to higher response rates for marketing practitioners in an increasingly competitive market. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Zwilling M.; Levy S.; Gvili Y.; Dostal P.,Tactical,10.1007/s11135-020-00972-0,Advertising; Machine learning; Product design; Symbolic design,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The research focuses on effective persuasive message design, which involves the application of machine learning to optimize marketing strategies.

"Recently, it has become easier to make use of various kinds of information on customers (e.g. customers' purchase history), due to the development of information technology. Especially in the marketing field, in fact, many companies try to employ customer segmentation for the services customization which leads to increase customer loyalty and to keep high customer retention. One of the well-known approaches for the customer analysis based on purchase history data is the RFM analysis. The RFM analysis is usually used to segment customers into several groups by using three variables; how long it has been since their last purchase, how many times they purchased, and how much they spent. However, the conventional method of the RFM analysis did not assume a generative model. Therefore, when applying to an actual data set and scoring each index of R, F, M scores, several problems occur. The main problem is that an analyst should arbitrarily decide the threshold for the scores of RFM. On the other hand, in the field of machine learning, the probabilistic latent semantic analysis is widely used for soft clustering. The latent class model enables us to cluster customers into latent classes and to calculate the assignment probabilities of each customer to each latent class. In this paper, we propose a new latent class model for the RFM analysis based on the purchase history data. The proposed model enables to decide the scoring of RFM and segment customers automatically, and the soft clustering approach helps the interpretation of the result. Furthermore, the proposed model takes account of the generation model of RFM scores. From the result of actual data analysis, it became clear that it is possible to extract latent classes that express the statistical characteristics of data well. Given a generative model estimated from the given data, it is also possible to predict future purchase behaviors of customers or to generate virtual data for simulation analysis and make decisions based on the result. We verify the effectiveness of our model by analyzing a real purchase history data of a Japanese major retail company. © 2020 KIIE",Zhang Q.; Yamashita H.; Mikawa K.; Goto M.,Tactical,10.7232/IEMS.2020.19.2.476,Latent Class Model; Marketing Segmentation; RFM Analysis,5.0,,15,0,Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers,"The abstract discusses the development of a new model for RFM analysis aimed at improving customer segmentation and retention strategies, which falls under tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Online reviews have become one of the most influential persuasive messages concerning decisions making. Researchers have explored different aspects of online reviews and the characteristics of reviewers using various methods; however, few studies have focused on consumers who do not post online reviews after purchasing, resulting in a gap in the research. This study aims to identify consumers’ characteristics and analyze the importance of consumers in different online review scenarios. We employed a fusion analysis framework, which used machine learning to determine the value of different types of consumers; in addition, we quantitatively estimate the relationship between variables and consumer types using econometrics modelling. This research used real consumer data from three data resources, solving problems related to the use of limited questionnaire datasets and single-source data. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that lurkers are more valuable than posters because they can be easily served and create more profit; thus, researchers should consider those who do not post online reviews rather than focusing only on the influence of online reviews and posters. Our findings also provide managerial implications for precision marketing by indicating that e-marketers should employ various marketing strategies and pay attention to different types of consumers, especially lurkers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Li Y.; Zhang L.,Tactical,10.1080/0144929X.2020.1759691,consumer characteristics; E-commerce; fusion analysis; Online review scenarios; precision marketing,5.0,,15,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The study analyzes consumer characteristics and the importance of different consumer types in online review scenarios, which aligns with structuring decisions related to marketing strategies and precision marketing.

"This study addresses the following question: For a given managerial, firm, and industry setting, which individual metrics are effective for making marketing-mix decisions that improve perceived performance outcomes? We articulate the key managerial takeaways based on testing a multi-stage behavioral framework that links decision context, metrics selection, and performance outcomes. Our statistical model adjusts for potential endogeneity bias in estimating metric effectiveness due to selection effects and differs from past literature in that managers can strategically choose metrics based on their ex-ante expected effectiveness. The key findings of our analysis of 439 managers making 1287 decisions are that customer-mindset marketing metrics such as awareness and willingness to recommend are the most effective metrics for managers to employ while financial metrics such as target volume and net present value are the least effective. However, relative to financial metrics, managers are more uncertain about the ex-ante effectiveness of customer-mindset marketing metrics, which attenuates their use. A second study on 142 managers helps provide detailed underlying rationale for these key results. The implications of metric effectiveness for dashboards and automated decision systems based on machine learning systems are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Mintz O.; Gilbride T.J.; Lenk P.; Currim I.S.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.08.003,Endogenous regression; Hierarchical Bayes; Managerial decision-making; Metric effectiveness; Rational expectations,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of different marketing metrics in a managerial context, aiming to improve perceived performance outcomes.

"Consumers’ preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model. © 2017 INFORMS.",Chen Y.; Iyengar R.; Iyengar G.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.0992,Conjoint analysis; Multimodal continuous heterogeneity; Sparse machine learning,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a modeling approach for understanding consumer preferences and segmentation, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The authors test methods, based on cognitively simple decision rules, that predict which products consumers select for their consideration sets. Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-ofconjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machinelearning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of competing methods and model selection, which are non-trivial issues given the financial implications. Researchers have adopted various methods including statistical models and machine learning methods such as neural networks to assist decision making in direct marketing. However, due to the different performance criteria and validation techniques currently in practice, comparing different methods is often not straightforward. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the performance of neural networks with that of classification and regression tree, latent class models and logistic regression using three criteria - simple error rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and cumulative lift - and two validation methods, i.e. bootstrap and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Systematic experiments are conducted to compare their performance. Findings - The results suggest that these methods vary in performance across different criteria and validation methods. Overall, neural networks outperform the others in AUROC value and cumulative lifts, and the stratified ten-fold cross-validation produces more accurate results than bootstrap validation. Practical implications - To select predictive models to support direct marketing decisions, researchers need to adopt appropriate performance criteria and validation procedures.

"With the recent development of web 2.0, there has been a lot of increase in social networking and online marketing sites. The data obtained from these sites are analysed for better human decision making. Sentiment analysis involves extraction of sentiments from reviews. Sentiments can be positive, negative or neutral. Most of the content on the internet is in the English language, but with the improved awareness of people, data in other languages is increasing gradually. Not much work has been done in Indian languages. Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English, is an informal language which is exceptionally famous in India as individuals feel greater talking in their language. In this paper, we present a dictionary-based approach for Hinglish text classification.

"In order to solve the problem of high communication error rate caused by inter symbol interference in high-speed visible light communication signal blind equalization algorithm, a high-speed visible light communication signal blind equalization algorithm is designed based on machine learning. The visible light communication channel model is constructed, and a fusion length limited coding mode is set to make the signal transmitted by visible light communication more in line with the overall response of the channel. The decision feedback equalizer is selected as the equalizer, and the channel cascade impulse response condition is set to compensate the distorted output of the channel. The blind equalization algorithm is designed to classify the data by unsupervised learning, and the extreme point of the error function is found through iterative calculation to optimize the equalizer. The simulation results show that under the same SNR test conditions, the bit error rate of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the blind equalization algorithm based on LMS and BP neural network. Under the condition of SNR = 20dB, the bit error rate is significantly reduced to the order of 10-5, with high communication quality. The VLC system uses an LED backlight display with a CMOS camera. In general, this panel is used to display marketing information. By adjusting the brightness of the CMOS camera's rolling shutter effect (RSE), additional data, such as dynamic content, may be wirelessly sent.

"Setting the retail price as a part of marketing would affect customers' cognition regarding products and affect their post-purchase behavior of review writing. To deeply understand the relationships between retail prices and reviews, this paper designs an intelligent data-driven Generate/Test Cycle using a machine learning technique to automatically discover the relationship model from a huge amount of data without a prior hypothesis. From a unique dataset, various free-form relationship models with their own structures and parameters have been discovered. By the comprehensive evaluations of candidate models, a guided map was offered to understand the relationship between dynamic retail prices and the volume/valence of reviews for different types of products. Experimental results show that 37.69% of products in our sample exhibit the following trend: When the price is increased to a certain level, the volume of reviews shifts from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend. Results also demonstrate that a linearly increasing relationship model between prices and the valence of reviews is more suitable for the low-involvement products than for the high-involvement products.

"Consumers often choose products by first forming a consideration set and then choosing from among considered products. When there are many products to screen (or many features to evaluate), it is rational for consumers to use consider-then-choose decision processes and to do so with heuristic decision rules. Managerial decisions (product development, marketing communications, etc.) depend upon the ability to identify and react to consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. We provide managerial examples and review the state-of-the-art in the theory and measurement of consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. Advances in greedoid methods, Bayesian inference, machine-learning, incentive alignment, measurement formats, and unstructured direct elicitation make it feasible and cost-effective to understand, quantify, and simulate ""what-if"" scenarios for a variety of heuristics.

"Marketing professionals face challenges of increasing complexity to adapt classic marketing strategies to the phenomenon of social networks. Companies are currently trying to take advantage of the useful collective knowledge available on social networks to support different types of marketing decisions. The appropriate analysis of this information can offer marketing professionals with important competitive advantages. This work proposes a new methodology to extract the social collective behavior of Twitter users concerning a group of brands based on the users’ temporal activity. Time series of mentions made by individual users to each company's Twitter account are aggregated to obtain collective activity data for the companies, which is a consequence of both the company's and other users’ actions. These data are processed using classical unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as temporal clustering and hidden Markov models, to extract collective temporal behavior patterns and models of the dynamics of customers over time for a single brand and groups of brands. The derived knowledge can be used for different tasks, such as identifying the impact of a marketing campaign on Twitter and comparatively assessing the social behaviors of different brands and groups of brands to assist in making marketing decisions. Our methodology is validated in a case study from the wine market. Twitter data were gathered from four regions of different countries around the world with important wineries (Italy: Veneto, Portugal: Porto and Douro Valley, Spain: La Rioja, and United States: Napa Valley), and comparative behavior analysis was carried out from the perspective of the use of Twitter as a communication channel for marketing campaigns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bello-Orgaz G.; Mesas R.M.; Zarco C.; Rodriguez V.; Cordón O.; Camacho D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102220,Hidden Markov models; Marketing analysis; Social collective behavior; Social networks; Temporal clustering; Temporal Twitter Activity; Wineries,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses methodologies for analyzing Twitter data to extract collective behavior patterns and assist in making marketing decisions, which aligns closely with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Increasingly popular social networks have become fast-growing platforms for information sharing, job searching, and product marketing. Information propagates rapidly in social network and may reach a very large population within a very short period of time. An excessive amount of information shared in social networks not only costs computational and communicational resources but also causes the information overload problem, which results in the delay and difficulty of making decisions and may lead to physical and psychological strain. We used computer technologies to attack this information overload problem. First, we developed automatic decision-making mechanisms to help each individual effectively share information. Second, we built a simulation test bed and proposed an evaluation matrix and then conducted an experimental evaluation of six different information-sharing strategies in terms of interest degrees, reachability, appreciation degrees, and communication cost. We also implemented two intelligent response mechanisms. The first one allows users to order information pieces according to the learned ratings of the information sources. The second mechanism dynamically adjusts the network structure based on machine-learning results. The simulation results show that such mechanisms would be very useful to motivate social-network users to adopt more selective information-sharing strategies. © 2014 IEEE.",Zhang X.S.; Zhang X.; Kaparthi P.,Tactical,10.1109/TCSS.2020.3001093,Information overload; information sharing; intelligent response; social networks,5.0,,15,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"The abstract discusses the development of automatic decision-making mechanisms and information-sharing strategies, which align with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-machine learning,10,70,Combat Information Overload Problem in Social Networks with Intelligent Information-Sharing and Response Mechanisms,2020

"Recently, the rapid growth in the number of customer reviews on e-commence platforms and in the amount of user-generated content has begun to have a profound impact on customer purchasing decisions. To counter the negative impact of social media marketing, some firms have begun hiring people to generate fake reviews which either promote their own products or damage their competitor’s reputation. This study proposes a framework, which takes advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, for the observation of behaviors among spammers. Then, based on the behavior of participants on web forums, the authors build up a post-reply network. The main focus is on the behavior-related features of the reviews, their propagation, and their popularity. The primary objective of this study is to build an effective online spammer detection model and the method detailed in this work can be used to improve the performance of spammer detection models. An experiment is carried out with a real dataset, the results of which indicate that these new features are important for identifying spammers.

"Social applications foster the involvement of end users in Web content creation, as a result of which a new source of vast amounts of data about users and their likes and dislikes has become available. Having access to users’ contributions to social sites and gaining insights into the consumers’ needs is of the utmost importance for marketing decision making in general, and to advertisement recommendation in particular. By analyzing this information, advertisement recommendation systems can attain a better understanding of the users’ interests and preferences, thus allowing these solutions to provide more precise ad suggestions. However, in addition to the already complex challenges that hamper the performance of recommender systems (i.e., data sparsity, cold-start, diversity, accuracy and scalability), new issues that should be considered have also emerged from the need to deal with heterogeneous data gathered from disparate sources. The technologies surrounding Linked Data and the Semantic Web have proved effective for knowledge management and data integration. In this work, an ontology-based advertisement recommendation system that leverages the data produced by users in social networking sites is proposed, and this approach is substantiated by a shared ontology model with which to represent both users’ profiles and the content of advertisements. Both users and advertisement are represented by means of vectors generated using natural language processing techniques, which collect ontological entities from textual content.

"This article highlights how social media data and language analysis can help managers understand brand positioning and brand competitive spaces to enable them to make various strategic and tactical decisions about brands. The authors use the output of topic models at the brand level to evaluate similarities between brands and to identify potential cobrand partners. In addition to using average topic probabilities to assess brands’ relationships to each other, they incorporate a differential language analysis framework, which implements scientific inference with multi-test-corrected hypothesis testing, to evaluate positive and negative topic correlates of brand names. The authors highlight the various applications of these approaches in decision making for brand management, including the assessment of brand positioning and future cobranding partnerships, design of marketing communication, identification of new product introductions, and identification of potential negative brand associations that can pose a threat to a brand's image. Moreover, they introduce a new metric, “temporal topic variability,” that can serve as an early warning of future changes in consumer preference.

"Product innovation, based on the identification and implementation of new solutions, is essential to keep a company competitive. However, the risk of failure of a new solution must be properly weighted during the decision-making in the design activity. This study proposes a method to evaluate a new design solution through the comparison with an old one to be substituted, and based on their requirements. In order to better evaluate the new solution, new requirements about its specific peculiarities are extracted from patents of similar solutions and considered in the evaluation. Requirements extraction is carried out automatically, through natural language processing, while the evaluation considers technical, marketing, and economic criteria. In particular, financial proceeds and patents investments were considered.

"[Purpose/Significance] Geographical indications (GIs) are an important tool for local governments in China to carry out brand building of agricultural products. Brand management is a continuous systematic project involving multiple subjects. Among them, the problem of government policy attention in the field of brand management of agricultural products with GIs deserves in-depth study. This paper aims to construct a policy attention analysis model in the field of brand management of GI agricultural products based on natural language processing technology. This model provides technical support for local governments to explore the status quo of local GI agricultural products' brand management, analyze the distribution of policy attention, and assist in optimizing strategies to promote their products' brand development. [Method/Process] The study is focused on the distribution of attention paths of GI agricultural products' brand management policies from the perspective of the local government: an analysis model of brand management policies of GI agricultural products was constructed in order to support the local government to carry out the analysis of the status quo of local agricultural products' brand management and policy optimization, and provide decision-making support for the optimization of brand management measures of the local agricultural products. First, this paper built a basic corpus based on the Python crawler technology, collected authoritative public information on the Internet, utilized the domain dictionary and UIE general information extraction framework to extract the text of management measures published in local government policies, and built a database of brand management measures of GI agricultural product. Second, a classification model of brand management measures of GI agricultural products based on the Transformer model was constructed. Third, this paper built a classification model based on the Transformer model, which can classify the extracted brand management measures of agricultural products and construct the policy attention distribution map. Finally, based on the policy attention distri-bution given by the model, we can find the brand management bottlenecks and recommend countermeasures to solve the bottlenecks. [Results/Conclusions] This paper takes Yantai apples as an example for model validation. After extracting and categorizing Yantai apples' brand management data, it is found that the policy attention of Yantai apples is more con-centrated, and the measures are highly similar, with 41.1% of the text of the measures focused on the part of brand positioning and planning, 31.7% on the part of brand competitiveness enhancement, and less than 10% on the part of brand marketing and protection. It can be seen that the brand effect of Yantai apples with GIs has not been well utilized. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology/Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi.

"In recent years, global urbanization and overdevelopment have resulted in environmental degradation and an energy crisis. Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed. The proposed model can be applied as an effective decision-support tool for green building pricing and formulating marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Juan Y.-K.; Hsu Y.-H.; Xie X.,Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.03.004,Artificial neural network (ANN); Consumer behavior; Decision-support model; Green building; Price premium,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The study focuses on developing a pricing model for green buildings, which is related to long-term decision-making and strategic goals regarding environmental sustainability and market positioning.",scopus-neural network,70,20,Identifying customer behavioral factors and price premiums of green building purchasing,2017
"Increasingly, on-demand nature of customer interactions put pressure on companies to build real-time campaign management systems. Instead of having managers to decide on the campaign rules, such as, when, how and whom to offer, creating intelligent campaign management systems that can automate such decisions is essential. In addition, regulations or company policies usually restrict the number of accesses to the customers. Efficient learning of customer behaviour through dynamic campaign participation observations becomes a crucial feature that may ultimately define customer satisfaction and retention. This paper builds on the recent successes of deep learning techniques and proposes a classification model to predict customer responses for campaigns. Classic deep neural networks are good at learning hidden relations within data (i.e., patterns) but with limited capability for memorization. One solution to increase memorization is to use manually craft features, as in Wide & Deep networks, which are originally proposed for Google Play App. recommendations. We advocate using decision trees as an easier way of mining high-level relationships for enhancing Wide & Deep networks. Such an approach has the added benefit of beating manually created rules, which, most of the time, use incomplete data and have biases. A set of comprehensive experiments on campaign participation data from a leading GSM provider shows that automatically crafted features make a significant increase in the accuracy and outperform Deep and Wide & Deep models with manually crafted features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Ayvaz D.; Aydoğan R.; Akçura M.T.; Şensoy M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101058,Decision tree classification; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Real-time marketing; Wide & Deep network models,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses building real-time campaign management systems and automating decisions related to customer interactions, which falls under tactical decision-making as it interprets strategic goals into structured targets like campaign automation and customer acquisition.",scopus-neural network,15,70,Campaign participation prediction with deep learning,2021
"The article materials are accented to the identification of the concept of the innovative culture of personnel management and the possibility of implementing universal project management methods in its formation. The urgency of the research is determined, first of all, by the need for a constant dynamic correction of techniques and instrument management personnel in order to build an innovative culture of personnel management at domestic enterprises. When writing, analytical and statistical methods are used during the detection and processing of domestic and foreign statistical data, the method of expert assessments in the formation of structural models, historical and logical methods in the extrapolation of the state of the past years for the future. The article materials emphasize the definition and characteristics of the concept of «Innovative Culture of Personnel Management». It is determined that the practical implementation of the instrument of the personnel management of the enterprise needs to use innovative techniques. Among these techniques, it is crucial to underscore Gantt charts, the Dupon method and Game Theory, personal marketing management, and others. Particular attention is focused on a graphical display of a Gantt chart, which reflects the time interval from the time of decision-making on the introduction of innovative methods in managing personnel to increase labor productivity and the growth of other enterprise performance indicators. It is noted that when making decisions on the expediency of changing the existing personnel management culture at the enterprise, it is worth using neural network models based on which it is possible to reveal a causal relationship between the decision and the reaction of the entire organizational system or a separate personality. It is detected that one of the main methods of investigation of the probable results from the introduction of an innovative culture of personnel management at the enterprise is to identify strengths and weaknesses in the process of implementing changes. The study of the LIFT methodological approach that uses the tools of ballroom assessments of the groups of attractiveness indicators of decisions on introducing an innovative personnel management culture and indicators that determine their risks are distinguished. The probability and expediency of using GAP analysis for the comparative characteristics of actual and potential development opportunities are researched and analyzed. It is stated that the use of this information will distinguish at the expertise stage the possibility of practical implementation of an innovative culture tool in full or fragmented scope to determine the means and techniques that will give the greatest effect to develop the intellectual and labor potential of the enterprise.

"Bidding for international construction projects is a critical decision for companies that aim to position themselves in the global construction market. Determination of attractive projects and markets where the competitive advantage of a company is high requires extensive environmental scanning, forecasting, and learning from the experience of competitors in international markets. In this paper, a neuronet model has been developed as a decision support tool that can classify international projects with respect to attractiveness and competitiveness based on the experiences of Turkish contractors in overseas markets. The model can be used to guide decision makers on which type of data should be collected during international business development and further help them to prepare priority lists during strategic planning. Information derived from the model demonstrates that the most important factors that increase attractiveness of an international project are availability of funds, market volume, economic prosperity, contract type, and country risk rating. Similarly, level of competition, attitude of host government, existence of strict quality requirements, country risk rating, and cultural/religious similarities are the most important factors that affect competitiveness of Turkish contractors in international markets.",Dikmen I.; Birgonul M.T.,Strategic,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:1(59),Bids; Construction industry; Contractors; Foreign projects; Neural networks; Turkey,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a decision support tool for classifying international construction projects, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and understanding competitive advantages in global markets.",scopus-neural network,60,25,Neural network model to support international market entry decisions,2004

"Fixation points, as the stopping location of eye movements, can be extracted to generate valuable information about a picture or an object. This information is valuable as it enables the identification of the area/part of the picture that attracts people's attention, which can be used as a consideration when making decisions in the future, for example in marketing. For this reason, in this study, a Neural Network (NN) model was developed to predict the fixation points of a picture. Specifically, the authors experimented with various transfer and training functions in the NN in order to determine which causes the fewest errors. The results show that the method used is applicable in practice since it produces MAPE (Mean Absolute Percent Error) of around 13-15% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) of 0.9-1.1%. © IJTech 2017.",Moch B.N.; Komarudin; Susilo M.S.,Tactical,10.14716/ijtech.v8i6.717,Eye tracking; Fixation points; MAPE; MSE; Neural network,5.0,,15,0,"Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia","The abstract discusses the development of a Neural Network model to predict fixation points in images, which can inform marketing decisions.

"Brand choice models, used for describing the process of choosing mutually exclusive alternatives, attracted a large amount of attention from researchers in the early of the recent decade. These models can be used as a market response simulator for simulating marketing strategies and assessing how changes in marketing variables such as pricing and promotions will influence consumer behavior and thus perform 'what-if' simulations. So a reliable and relevant brand choice model can be very useful and effective, which, in fact, represents a worthwhile opportunity to improve the efficiency of the marketing decisions. In this paper we offer a new approach by integrating of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Data preprocessing for brand choice modeling and constructing a market response simulator. This approach, called Preprocessed-Probabilistic Neural Network (PPNN), consists of two main stages. First, a robust Genetic Based Instance Selection Model (GBIS) employed to look for a representative data subset of instances in training data set. The second stage ends up with a relevant brand choice model, using a probabilistic neural network trained by Dynamic Decay Adjustment Algorithm (DDA). The evaluation process is carried out using the same data set been used in literature for modeling individual consumer choices in a retail coffee market. The evaluation results show that the offered approach outperforms all previous methods, so it can be considered as an effective tool for consumer behavior modeling and simulation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
