"Despite the benefits that market segmentation could provide to marketers, it is uncertain to what extend market segmentation research informs decisions about marketing strategy in the tourism industry in Africa. The purpose of this paper is to appraise the incidence of market segmentation research in this context. Market segmentation is used to demarcate a broad market into smaller segments to enable the formulation of marketing strategies based on segment needs. A review of journal articles with market segmentation in the tourism industry in the African context as a focus area is provided. While research in this context is available, recommendations are made about possible market segmentation research focus areas in the tourism industry in an African context. © 2021",Visser H.,Strategic,10.46222/ajhtl.19770720.114,African context; market segmentation; Marketing strategy; research; tourism industry,5.0,,10,5,Africa Journals,"The abstract discusses the importance of market segmentation research in formulating long-term marketing strategies within the tourism industry in Africa.

"It has become a marketing trend for marketers to use influencers to advertise and sell products because influencers can affect the attitudes and decision-making of other social media users. Most previous research on influencer marketing has concentrated on its effectiveness as a promotional tool. In contrast, there have been limited studies on the influencer-social media user relationship. The relationship that influencers have with other social media users is the foundation for the success of influencer marketing. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the factors that affect the influencers’ relationships with other users. In accordance with the concept of information relevance, this study presents a model relating the various attributes of influencer-generated content with emotional attachment and information quality to examine the relationship between influencers and other social media users. The findings of a survey of 280 respondents indicate that the interestingness, novelty, reliability, and understandability of influencer-generated content can effectively increase users’ emotional attachment to influencers. Reliability and understandability can also have a significant positive impact on information quality. This eventually inclines social media users to follow or recommend influencers to others, which can increase the popularity of influencers. This study helps researchers and marketers advance their understanding of influencers’ relationships with other social media users and offers management-related recommendations for influencers and marketers. © 2022 by the authors.

"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of sustainability certifications on consumer preferences. The study investigates whether product certifications have a significant influence on consumer preferences and examines which certificate groups work best from a marketer's perspective for matching the different consumer preferences. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a quantitative survey approach, based on a conjoint analysis carried out in the Brazilian juice market. Findings: The results of 210 respondents indicate that the certifications chosen generally increase the evaluation of products. The effects, however, differ significantly between the three segments identified, especially between the two most important ones that have a combined market share of almost 90%. Our results show that demographic differences between the clusters are only marginal, as are the specific certification preferences, with a small advantage for organic certification. Research limitations/implications: The certificates chosen serve as an example that represents the various categories. The utility of similar certificates of the same category might be different. The scope of the research is also limited to the market for ready-to-drink juice. Practical implications: Using a dual targeting strategy, this study makes relevant recommendations for managing product certification. On the one hand, managers should consider a highly priced, certified product and, on the other, a low priced, uncertified product for satisfying identified demands. Decisions with regard to certification differentiation should mostly rely on the specific costs of the process because of limited consumer differentiation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on the influence that product certification has on consumer preferences by adding to the matter of certificate choice, especially from a marketer's perspective. Resolving this issue is important for facilitating the choice of those certificates that contribute most toward increasing consumer preference. Little research has been conducted into different certification groups and categories or the joint appearance of their different labels. Most of the research being carried out is aimed at the food market in developed countries, particularly in North America and Europe. Research in an emerging economy, therefore, introduces new scientific insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Prell M.; Zanini M.T.; Caldieraro F.; Migueles C.,Tactical,10.1108/MIP-12-2019-0616,Certification; Labeling; Product preference; Sustainability marketing; Sustainable certifications,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on how product certifications influence consumer preferences and offers recommendations for product pricing and certification strategies, which are tactical aspects of marketing decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Sustainability certifications and product preference,2020
"Research of business interaction in marketing channels is often associated with the necessity to study the optimal business game scenarios, which provide the best implementation of enterprises business behavior strategies and maximize their profits. In such situati ons involvement of game-theoretic modeling apparatus in the process of determining key factors influencing profits formation of manufacturers and retailers, contributes to a better understanding of the cause and the effect relationships between the magnitude of profits, interpreted in the form of indicators of business strategies, and creates the prerequisites for finding ways of sharing joint profits in marketing channels. The purpose of study is to find optimal values in terms of channel members profits maximizing of the parameters of the advertising cost response function, in which the manufacturer and the retailer by agreement make decisions on the implementation of business game strategies, including pricing strategies and strategies for generating joint advertising costs. The paper presents a numerical experiment on the possible values of the parameters of the advertising cost response function, which takes into account the recommendations of the practice of enterprises functioning in distribution channels. Mathematical calculations have been made, which allow to build a model of cooperative game of the manufacturer and the retailer, based on the non-dimensional form of retail price values as well as values of joint advertising costs. The optimal solution of cooperative game, which within the numerical experiment is presented as the possible maximum values of profits of the manufacturer, the retailer and the vertical marketing channel, is made. The comparative analysis of the soluti ons of cooperative game and non-cooperative game, which involves the formation of Nash equilibrium, is given to determine the benefits of cooperative game model for both participants of the vertical marketing channel in terms of maximizing their profits and profit of the channel as a whole. The results obtained can be an information base for further calculations and comparisons of cooperative and non-cooperative models as interactions between participants of supply chains. In addition, the results of numerical simulations form the initial base for comparisons with other variants of cooperative game model, which involve changing a range and a step change of output values of the model. © 2020 IJSTR.",Danyliuk N.; Zhemba A.; Dyma O.; Sazonets O.; Kachan O.,Strategic,,Advertising cost response function; Business game strategy; Cooperative game; Nash equilibrium; Profit; Retail price; Transfer price,5.0,,10,0,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,"The abstract discusses the use of game-theoretic modeling to identify optimal business strategies for maximizing profits in marketing channels.

"Based on the internationalization of higher education in the current global highly compet-itive education market, the current study aims to explore the factors affecting students in the selection of the country to continue their higher education. Following the mixed-method approach, the researchers collected data from international students studying in Germany and the United King-dom (UK). The qualitative phase identified six themes: academic, social, personal, financial, career, and marketing as the highly influential elements in students’ choice to study abroad. Empirical analyses indicate that students in both countries consider academic reputation as a dominant theme in the selection of country for HEI. However, noteworthy differences were identified in the subse-quent themes. Moreover, international students in Germany were found more satisfied with their choice of the country as compared to the students in the UK. This study provides valuable insights to the academic policymakers in the host and home countries concerning factors that pull and push students to study abroad. It also proposes recommendations to counter the brain drain element. © 2021 by the authors.

"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online reviews are important sources of information that help consumers decide which products and services to buy. Although C2C reviews in video format (e.g., on YouTube) have become increasingly popular, research remains focused primarily on textual reviews. This article emphasizes the importance of C2C video reviews in influencing consumer outcomes through parasocial interaction, a special—albeit one-sided—connection with reviewers. Interactivity and self-disclosure are suggested as online communication techniques reviewers can use to foster parasocial interaction with their viewers in a single encounter. Parasocial interaction is further established as a psychological mechanism that underlines the impacts of interactivity and self-disclosure on source credibility, leading to improved consumer purchase intentions. The authors also propose that strong parasocial interaction with reviewers exerts a particularly powerful influence on the purchase decisions of consumers who experience low levels of decision confidence, while arguing for the importance of C2C video reviews in guiding the decisions of various consumer groups. Research recommendations reveal how managers can encourage consumers to create and share video reviews on different platforms and offer guidance on the ways companies can foster parasocial interaction through firm-related marketing communications. © The Author(s) 2022.",Penttinen V.; Ciuchita R.; Čaić M.,Tactical,10.1177/10949968221102825,C2C reviews; interactivity; parasocial interaction; self-disclosure; video reviews,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,The abstract discusses the influence of C2C video reviews on consumer purchase intentions and suggests communication techniques (interactivity and self-disclosure) that can be employed by reviewers.

"In-store displays aim to boost sales of both utilitarian and hedonic products. Noting typical differences in the information processing and purchase behavior evoked by these product types, and building on congruency theory principles, the authors propose that different types of in-store displays (i.e., island, end-of-aisle, or shelf signage) are more appropriate for utilitarian versus hedonic products, and the use of price or product promotions might reinforce these effects. With a database that combines three data sources (scanner, observational, and survey), this article presents an analysis of a market share model at the SKU level. The results confirm that in-store displays have differential effects on sales, depending on their characteristics; congruency between the decision-making process of utilitarian versus hedonic products and the characteristics of in-store display types moderates their effectiveness in terms of SKU sales. Shelf signage strongly increases the sales of utilitarian products, whereas island and end-of-aisle displays increase sales of hedonic product categories more effectively. The use of congruent promotions creates synergistic influences that reinforce these effects. In particular, price promotions improve the impact of shelf signage on utilitarian products, and product promotions strengthen the impacts of island and end-of-aisle displays on hedonic products. These results extend prior research on in-store marketing actions and the nature of utilitarian versus hedonic products, as well as providing recommendations for retailers and manufacturers seeking to optimize their retail space and commercial budgets. © 2020 New York University",Garrido-Morgado Á.; González-Benito Ó.; Martos-Partal M.; Campo K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretai.2020.10.005,Congruency principle; Dual information processing mode; Hedonic product; In-store display; Utilitarian product,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the effects of in-store displays on sales of utilitarian and hedonic products, focusing on specific marketing tactics such as display types and promotions.

"Purpose: Earlier work has suggested that assumptions, values and beliefs about the importance of cooperating with competitors (a coopetition-oriented mindset) should manifest into behavioural forms of coopetition, such as resource and capability-sharing activities. Yet, limited research surrounds the complexities of this link. The purpose of this study is to unpack the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and coopetition-oriented behaviours under the moderating roles of industry experience and degree of internationalization, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view. Design/methodology/approach: The chosen empirical context was the Canadian wine industry because wine producers are often involved in coopetition strategies and have varying degrees of internationalisation. Preliminary interview data were collected from 18 managers to shape the operationalisations. Then survey data were collected from 195 Canadian wine producers. After checking the statistical data for all major assessments of reliability and validity (together with common method variance), the hypothesised and control paths were tested through hierarchical regression. Findings: A coopetition-oriented mindset had a positive and significant association with coopetition-oriented behaviours. Surprisingly, this link was negatively moderated by industry experience. Additionally, degree of internationalisation yielded a positive moderation effect. These moderators highlight situations where a coopetition-oriented mindset is (and is not) likely to manifest into coopetition activities. Practical implications: If firms aim to engage in behavioural forms of coopetition, they should manage assumptions, values and beliefs associated with the advantages of collaborating with their competitors. Industry experience can limit the extent to which business’ coopetition-oriented mindsets manifest into coopetition-oriented behaviours. This could be explained by decision makers possessing information that discourages them from working with certain (untrustworthy) rivals because of the potential harmful effects on their performance. Companies should use their industry experience to avoid working with rival entities that will create negative outcomes, such as tensions (e.g., conflict, power imbalances and opportunistic behaviours), lost intellectual property and diluted competitive advantages. Nonetheless, industry experience might signify that there are more risks than rewards linked with these business-to-business marketing strategies. Higher levels of internationalisation can help firms to recognise that coopetition-oriented behaviours may lead to performance-enhancing opportunities in their overseas markets. Originality/value: This investigation contributes to the business-to-business marketing literature with new evidence on how organisations can foster a coopetition-oriented mindset to engage in coopetition strategies. The negative moderation effect from industry experience highlights that knowledge of competitors’ activities can limit the extent to which coopetition-oriented behaviours are implemented. Moreover, the positive interaction effect from degree of internationalisation extends the growing body of knowledge pertaining to coopetition in an international arena. Collectively, these results show that while a coopetition-oriented mindset is a critical driver of coopetition-oriented behaviours, there are certain contingencies that can strengthen or weaken this association. Finally, by integrating resource-based theory and the relational view, this paper could explore the different forms of coopetition, in terms of organisation-wide mindsets and firm-level behaviours. This paper concludes with some managerial recommendations, alongside a series of limitations and avenues for future research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Crick J.M.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-03-2020-0165,Coopetition-oriented behaviours; Coopetition-oriented mindsets; Degree of internationalisation; Industry experience; Relational view; Resource-based theory,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and behaviours, focusing on how these concepts can influence long-term strategies in business, particularly in the context of the Canadian wine industry.

"Purpose: This study investigates how Danmu (danmaku) technological features (DTFs) of recommendation vlogs (rec-vlogs) impact consumer experiences and decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique with a sample of 422 viewers of Danmu-enabled rec-vlogs to examine the proposed model. Findings: The DTFs positively affect consumer loyalty intentions through the mediation of social presence and immersion. Also, vlogger-product congruency significantly moderates the relationship between social presence and immersion. Originality/value: With the increasing popularity of vlogs, retailers have adopted the vlog as a new marketing channel to connect with consumers. Although a growing body of studies focuses on this phenomenon, little is known about how DTFs help to increase consumer loyalty toward using rec-vlogs as product information sources. Anchored on the stimulus–organism–response framework, this study investigates how pseudo-synchronicity, Danmu-content congruency and parallelism, three DTFs used in rec-vlogs, impact consumer experiences of social presence and immersion, eventually influence the consumers' loyalty intentions toward rec-vlogs. The authors also examine whether the effect of social presence on immersion is contingent on vlogger-product congruency. These findings have implications for both researchers and practitioners to understand the effect of DTFs in the context of rec-vlogs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Yang T.; Yang F.; Men J.,Tactical,10.1108/ITP-01-2021-0008,Danmu technological features; Immersion; Loyalty intention; Recommendation vlog; Social presence; S–O–R framework; Vlogger-product congruency,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on examining the impact of Danmu technological features on consumer experiences and loyalty intentions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions related to user engagement and personalization in vlogs.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,The impact of Danmu technological features on consumer loyalty intention toward recommendation vlogs: a perspective from social presence and immersion,2022
"This article explores the role of information in high risk consumer decision making. Forty-two qualitative interviews were undertaken with international non-EU postgraduates when making the high risk decision to study in a UK Business School. Prospective international postgraduates moved iteratively through the stages in Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process model and learnt from the search process they had undertaken in a continuous cyclical manner. Word-of-mouth recommendations were the most influential sources of information gathered, and online sources were perceived to be credible regardless of their origins. The perception of risk impacted the rigour of the information search process. An iterative decision making cycle model is proposed with Kuhlthau’s model and word of mouth information at its core, which reflects the connectedness of individuals in this digital era.

"Access to medicines treating rare diseases (‘orphan medicines’) has proven challenging due to high prices and clinical uncertainty. To optimise market access to these medicines, some healthcare systems are implementing specialised pathways and/or processes during marketing authorisation (MA) and/or health technology assessment (HTA). Comparing one setting where these medicines are classed as “orphan” (Scotland) to another where they considered “non-orphan” (Canada), this study aims to explore whether the presence of specialised pathways and processes at MA and HTA levels is associated with more favourable funding recommendations and faster time to market access. A matched sample of 116 medicine-indication pairs with MA approval from 2001 to 2019 in Europe and Canada was identified, and publicly available sources were used for data extraction. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. All medicines were commercially marketed in both countries, except one instance in Scotland. In Scotland, more orphan medicines (68.1%) had a favourable HTA recommendation than in Canada (60.4%), while Canada issued more negative HTA recommendations (20.7%) than Scotland (15.5%). Low levels of agreement on HTA recommendations and the main reasons driving recommendations were found between settings. In both countries, medicines with specialised MA approval were less likely to receive negative HTA recommendations than medicines with standard MA. Time to market access was faster in Canada than Scotland, though medicines with specialised MA approval had slower timelines than medicines with standard MA approval in both countries. However, it is unclear whether the presence of orphan designation and HTA specialised processes alone could result in favourable funding recommendations without accounting for other healthcare system-related factors and differences in the decision-making processes across settings. Holistic approaches and better alignment of evidentiary requirements across regulators are needed to optimise access to orphan medicines. © 2022",Fontrier A.-M.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115119,Access; Health technology assessment; HTA; Marketing authorisation; Orphan medicines; Rare diseases; Specialised pathways; Specialised processes,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract focuses on the challenges and processes related to access to orphan medicines, which falls outside the realm of marketing-related decisions and applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Market access for medicines treating rare diseases: Association between specialised processes for orphan medicines and funding recommendations,2022
"Experiential marketing is being considered by researchers and marketers as an alternative solution to traditional marketing for achieving the best results for organisational lifetime value. However, network operators are preoccupied with traditional marketing programmes and strategies, which have produced limited results (value). This study sought to utilise experiential marketing as a tool to create value for mobile network operators, as well as provide recommendations to avoid future gaps. This study utilised a positivistic paradigm and a quantitative approach through a self-administered, structured hard copy questionnaire for data collection. Stratification and convenience sampling techniques were used to select participants from each of the regional offices of the network operators in Ghana. The database of the national communication authority (NCA) of Ghana was accessed to identify the number of registered operators and the associated subscribed customers in the country. A total of 415 customers responded to the survey. The study concluded that experiential marketing had a positive and sustainable influence on value (business value). It is envisaged that this study could assist network operators and other businesses to create value by understanding the factors influencing experiential marketing, thereby assisting in the formulation of effective and efficient strategies and decisions. Furthermore, this study offers practical recommendations that could strengthen businesses when establishing experiential marketing programmes.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study resides in a better understanding of the relationship between the use of traditional operators, online travel agencies, such as Booking.com and Expedia, comparators, tour operators and traditional travel agencies, airlines, new non-tourist companies like Google and the use of sharing economy platforms to obtain information about a travel destination. Design/methodology/approach: Applying an analysis to 13,243 tourists from 19 European countries, a binomial logit analysis was carried out with the latest version of the SPSS statistical analysis program. Findings: The use of Expedia and Booking.com has a positive effect on the use of sharing economy platforms to obtain information about travel destinations. However, it can also be observed how the use of Google, Facebook, tour operators and travel agencies, airlines and Twitter can have a negative effect. Practical implications: The study provides interesting recommendations for destinations to be able to design better marketing strategies which focus on cognitive components of the destination image in different information sources. Originality/value: Tourists search for information that helps them make better decisions when it comes to choosing a travel destination and they do so using different channels that have evolved over time. The proliferation of internet platforms has transformed the way tourists search for information and consequently the way the secondary image of destination is formed. The sharing economy plays an important role in this new tourism ecosystem.

However, previous studies have not inquired about the relationship between them all. © 2020, International Tourism Studies Association.",Almeida-Santana A.; David-Negre T.; Moreno-Gil S.,Tactical,10.1108/IJTC-09-2019-0173,Destination choice; Information sources; Sharing economy; Social media; Tourist behaviour,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study provides insights into how various information sources can influence tourists' decision-making processes, which aligns with tactical marketing strategies aimed at optimizing customer engagement and targeting.",scopus-recommendation,15,65,New digital tourism ecosystem: understanding the relationship between information sources and sharing economy platforms,2020
"Purpose: The use of threats to force supplier compliance is a common practice in current business affairs. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the supplier’s decision process to comply to or resist such a coercive strategy. The paper aims to develop a more comprehensive view of the decision process used by suppliers when threatened by their customers, as well as discover new phenomena regarding supplier Decision-Making Under Threat (DUT). More specifically, it aims at (1) gaining a better understanding of threats by looking at their patterns and commonalities and (2) identifying which consideration factors are relevant when suppliers evaluate threats. Method: To identify which consideration factors are relevant to suppliers when deciding how to react to threats, the study employed an exploratory approach by interviewing 17 marketing practitioners with experiences in DUT. The in-depth interviews lasted between thirty-five and sixty-five minutes and were transcribed. Descriptive coding and template analysis generated thirty-nine descriptors and nine categories that are deemed important when considering DUT. The authors also evaluated the intensity of each of the consideration factors present in the decision process. Findings: The results reveal that it is possible to categorize threats into three components: Objectives, Penalties and Manifestations. Objectives are what the customer is trying to achieve by using the threat, namely demanding price reductions, appropriating intellectual property, procuring financial statements, receiving a bribe, increasing technical requirements, accessing a cost breakdown, modifying delivery terms, and modifying payment terms. The penalty is what the supplier can expect to happen when refusing to comply, such as losing the customer’s sales. Finally, manifestations describe how the threat is presented by the customer. Study results show that these manifestations may be categorized according to their level of ambiguity, predictability, and candor. The results also reveal that at least five cognitive decision criteria are typically considered during the decision process although at different intensity levels from each participant. These criteria include: Dependence, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Relationship Quality, Relational Norm Violations, and Mimetic Isomorphism. Several interesting discoveries were made. For example, Dependence is both the consideration factor for which most people emphasized its influence on their decision and for which most people said that it had no influence at all. Relational norm violations is unique by being the only criterion for which no participant mentioned that it does not influence their decision. The overwhelming majority of study participants considered more than three criteria during the DUT process. Finally, participants said that they experienced negative emotions such as anger and frustration when exposed to threats albeit most did not recognize that it played a role in their decision. These emotions are however believed to be a factor in reducing the supplier’s willingness to comply. Overall, the study finds that DUT is a complex decision process regarding supplier adaptation, and can be a highly emotional experience with long-lasting effects. Research implications: The face-to-face interviews used to collect narratives of participants being exposed to customer threats is deemed an appropriate and highly recommendable methodological approach. When collecting data on reactions to threats and their accompanying emotional reaction several non-verbal signs that the participants physically demonstrated were an essential component in fully interpreting the data. As such, future research on the topic could include video recordings of the interviews. The narratives were also very efficient in recalling the emotions associated with the coercive event though the interviews sometimes occurred several years afterward. The participants’ opinions are consistent with academia’s view regarding the ambiguous role of emotions during decision-making. On the one hand, emotions are recognized to play an important role, they should be acknowledged and understood, while on the other hand, many believe that emotions should not contaminate the decision process. By combining five cognitive criteria with emotions in a DUT framework, the paper incorporates knowledge from the field of psychology into the business-to-business marketing literature. The article highlights the fact that the study of both threats in a business setting and the role of emotions in decision-making are neglected topics that deserve more academic attention. Practical implications: From the customer’s perspective an improved understanding of the supplier’s DUT may help customers limit the damage to relationships when using coercive influence strategies such as threats. From the supplier’s perspective, the results emphasize the importance to decompose their customer’s threat in order to better respond to its use. By also taking into account all consideration factors suppliers can take better quality decisions. The results provide several recommendations such as to include intangibles in the cost-benefit analysis instead of solely focusing on the short-term financial impact. Emotional control has been stressed by the participants as a key managerial ability to master when faced with threats. Originality/value/contribution: By merging the influence strategy research stream and the supplier adaptation research stream together, the study generates a few original and noteworthy contributions. A better understanding of threats is garnered by breaking them down into three components, which consequently extends our understanding of influence strategies. The study also contributes to a deeper understanding of the supplier’s DUT, a new concept described in the paper, by identifying how decision makers include multiple criteria in their decision process. Very few academic papers have specifically looked into threats as a coercive strategy despite its prevalent use in business environments. Those that did focused on a limited set of criteria when analyzing the decision to adapt. The article expands on these previous studies by proposing five decision criteria, which are often considered collectively by participants when examining adaptation under threat, and emphasizes a factor neglected in previous research, namely the role of emotions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bourguignon B.; Boeck H.; Clarke T.B.,Strategic,10.1080/1051712X.2020.1831210,buyer-seller relationships; decision process; emotions; influence strategies; Threats,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the decision-making process of suppliers under threats, highlighting long-term implications of coercive strategies in business relationships.

FDA issued a marketing order for IQOS in April 2019, which Philip Morris is using to promote IQOS outside the USA. Methods We analysed FDA's Technical Project Lead Review and marketing order for IQOS, relevant law and guidance on PMTAs and independent research on the health impacts of IQOS. Results FDA found that the evidence PMPSA submitted did not demonstrate reduction in long-term disease risks and that IQOS aerosol emits toxins with carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, some at higher levels than conventional cigarettes. PMPSA did not appropriately consider the health impacts of dual use, the product's attractiveness to youth or data showing that consumers do not accurately perceive the addiction risks of IQOS. Despite FDA's own scientists' recommendations and independent research showing that IQOS presents serious risks to users including cytotoxic, genotoxic, hepatotoxic, cardiovascular and pulmonary risks, FDA concluded that IQOS is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. Conclusion FDA's decision allowing IQOS to be marketed in the USA disregarded valid scientific evidence and misapplied the public health standard mandated by law. This decision may have important health impacts, influence marketing IQOS outside the USA and erode public confidence in FDA's future PMTA decisions.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

"The authors develop an agent-based model of the market where firms and consumers exchange products. Consumers in the model are heterogeneous in terms of features, such as risk-aversion or owned assets, which impact their individual decisions. Consumers constantly learn about products' features through personal experience, word-of-mouth, or advertising, update their expectations and share their opinions with others. From the supply-side of the model, firms can influence consumers with two marketing tools: advertising and pricing policy. Series of experiments have been conducted with the model to investigate the relationship between advertising and pricing and to understand the underlying mechanism.

"Every year about 95% of new products fail for a simple reason that most customers do not have the time or energy to think about the advantages or disadvantages of the products they place in their shopping carts, so they rely on shortcuts to make a purchase decision such as quality, beauty and excellence of product packaging. Packaging becomes part and parcel of our contemporary life especially in the continuous development for the conception of marketing. It becomes one of the basic dimensions for the concept of production because it plays big role to emphasize the mental image of the product on the consumer’s side. The importance of packaging leads several of marketing thinkers to consider it as enclosed marketing mix elements and one of corner stone in which goods depend on its success process. Therefore, the current study aims to study the concept and the importance of packaging and its role in attracting the consumer’s attention, and to determine the difficulties that the companies undergo in the field of packaging. The study depends on assembling the primary data on questionnaire designed especially for this purpose, and distributed to 600 consumers in Riyadh city. In addition to that secondary data is collected from resources related to the study subject. Simple statistical analysis is used to analyze the data. The results of research confirm the big role for the packaging in consumer attraction in study sample with all dimensions (design, color, size, and shape). The most important recommendation of the study is that to adopt a clear policy for packing in industrial organizations that cope with high technological development and the fast changing in consumer's tastes. It must be taken into the consideration the modern marketing orientations in product's packaging including the green marketing that depends on using material that has a little environmental effect at packaging process compared with traditional methods. © 2020 by the authors.",Alhamdi F.M.,Tactical,10.5267/j.msl.2019.11.040,Consumer attention; Cover color; Cover design; Packaging,5.0,,15,0,Growing Science,"The abstract discusses the importance of packaging in marketing and consumer attraction, emphasizing the need for companies to adopt clear policies in their packaging strategies.

"The 2018-2019 Student Affairs Standing Committee addressed charges related to examining the institutional leadership models and professional development needs of faculty and staff to optimize achievement of Strategic Priority #1 on the applicant pipeline. The report provides five recommendations to AACP and twelve suggestions for colleges and schools of pharmacy. The committee focused on the need to develop tailored leadership training and mentoring programs for admissions personnel on relevant topics, including change management, holistic thinking, leadership, problem solving, technical knowledge, professional development, paths for promotion, conflict resolution, networking, persuasive communication, and strategic planning. Rather than develop new resources, the committee identified existing professional competencies and assessment resources developed by other organizations for student affairs and admissions personnel that could spur enhanced strategic marketing and professional development opportunities in pharmacy education. It also reaffirmed the need for student diversity and the use of data to drive strategic decisions in recruitment. To identify gaps in knowledge among AACP member institutions, the committee analyzed the results of its fall 2018 survey on the current depth and breadth of student recruitment activities and their perceived effectiveness. The committee also recommended ways institutions can encourage faculty and others outside of the admissions office to participate in student recruitment activities. Finally, the committee concluded that it will be necessary for colleges and schools to collaborate across the academy to promote the benefits of pharmacy profession to prospective students, rather than individual colleges and schools of pharmacy, and be more responsive to the expectations of Gen Z students before the tide in applications will shift in a positive direction. © 2019, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

"Emphasized by the World Health Organization as one of its key topics, patient empowerment (PE)-i.e., the set of self-determined behaviors based on patients' individual needs for developing autonomy and competence with their disease-is today regarded as a key component of a patient-centered approach to healthcare. Unfortunately, research lacks a clear understanding of the drivers of PE, its relationship to therapy compliance, and its role in different types of diseases. Using a large sample of 1622 patients suffering from chronic diseases, this study addresses these critical research gaps and provides three major contributions. First, by exploring the influence of PE antecedents (i.e., patients' health involvement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of physician authority), it provides specific recommendations on how to effectively manage PE (defined in terms of three dimensions: information search, knowledge development, and decision participation). Second, it demonstrates the importance of PE and its antecedents for affecting patients' therapy compliance and shows that, depending on the PE dimension, therapy compliance is either enhanced or reduced. By highlighting the ambiguous role of PE in therapy compliance, the study offers specific suggestions for healthcare stakeholders on how to maximize patients' compliance to recommended therapies. Third, the study provides important insights into the role of PE across different types of chronic diseases, offering practical recommendations on how to deal with patients depending on their particular disease. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Prigge J.-K.; Dietz B.; Homburg C.; Hoyer W.D.; Burton J.L.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.05.009,Healthcare marketing; Patient behavior; Patient empowerment; Therapy compliance,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses patient empowerment in healthcare, which is not related to marketing applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Patient empowerment: A cross-disease exploration of antecedents and consequences,2015
"Purpose: Customers are interested in finding service recommendations, reviews and word of mouth using social networking platforms. These service reviews are useful for enhancing service quality, level of information and engagement, and purchase intention of customers. The purpose of this paper is to uncover which social networking platform is more useful for the exchange of service reviews and how organizations are improving purchase intention as well as service quality in the light of customer’s reviews/experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The study is exploratory in nature because it aims to understand the use of social networking platforms for enhancing service quality and the purchase intention of customers using a purposive sampling technique. To meet the objective of this study, non-directive and semi-structured interviews have been conducted with customers and marketing teams in the banking sector and internet service providers. Findings: The results show that social networking websites are helpful in fostering responsiveness, awareness, assurance, reliability and empathy. However, respondents revealed serious concerns regarding the privacy of personal and financial information especially in the context of the banking sector. It has been found that official Facebook pages of service-providing organizations, open and closed local community Facebook groups, sponsored ads and promotional advertisements on Facebook, WhatsApp groups and YouTube video comments are more frequently used to exchange service reviews (i.e. influence the process of purchase decision) among friends, friends of friends, family members and the general public. The selected customers and market team respondents revealed that local community Facebook groups (i.e. open groups and closed groups) have gained prime importance for enhancing service quality and purchase decisions. Practical implications: The effective and well-organized use of social networking platforms can foster service reviews, word of mouth, level of service awareness, interactive communication, intention to purchase, social influence, social trust and services quality. Furthermore, online social networking platforms require a lower level of advertisement costs and offer huge amounts of information, discussions, enquires, service stories, word of mouth, transactions and interactions of consumers. Originality/value: The present study is exploratory in nature because it selects an under-researched issue regarding the use of social networking applications to enhance levels of purchase intention and service quality. There is limited literature which has combined the multiple constructs in a single study (i.e. social media platforms, cross-platform platforms, service quality and purchase intention of consumers). Most of the previous studies are dependent on various dimensions of service quality (i.e. “reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empath and tangibles”). However, the present study extracted that respondents have given more preferences of services awareness and privacy compared to traditional elements of service quality. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Naeem M.,Tactical,10.1108/JMD-11-2018-0327,Purchase intention of customers; Service sector; Services quality; Social networking applications,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses how social networking platforms are used to enhance service quality and purchase intention, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific marketing targets and optimizing customer engagement.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Do social networking platforms promote service quality and purchase intention of customers of service-providing organizations?,2019
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine health-related social advertisements to identify its use and evaluate its appropriateness to situational needs, such as epidemic dynamics and the context where it is implemented. The paper also discusses the barriers that policymakers face in creating these linkages. Design/methodology/approach: In all, 375 national HIV/AIDS prevention television advertisements from France, Germany, Portugal and Italy were viewed and analyzed over time of production, exploring the sources, the target audiences and the messages delivered. This paper compares management choices with HIV epidemics in each country and their contextual profiles. Findings: The findings of this paper indicate that social advertising concerned with HIV/AIDS prevention is commonly framed within public policies and does not usually target the most vulnerable and affected populations. Furthermore, social ads are reactive to epidemic dynamics. The existence of trade-offs between putting forward theoretical marketing recommendations and taking account of contextual fracturing issues or increasing stigma and discrimination are also considered. Research limitations/implications: This paper is useful for public sector management because of the importance of evaluating the investments done to improve future strategies.

"Fertilizer not only plays a major role in the profitability of the farmer's business, but also represents an expensive farm input. The emerging farmer market segment is expanding and holds a great deal of potential for fertilizer companies to supply the growing need for fertilizer in this market. Almost all fertilizer marketing strategies of South African companies have been designed to cater for the commercial farming sector; however, if fertilizer suppliers want to focus on the emerging farmer market segment, they need to understand buying behavior of emerging farmers, as well as their needs when developing strategies to utilize opportunities in this developing market. This study aims to identify factors playing an important role in the buying behavior of emerging farmers in the Free State when purchasing fertilizer.

"In spite of vast business potential, targeted advertising in public transportation systems is a grossly unexplored research area. For instance, SBS Transit in Singapore can reach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than $35 million. To bridge the gap, we propose a probabilistic data model that captures the motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an advertisement among the passengers. In particular, we leverage hundreds of millions of bus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as the extent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model, we study a top-k retrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation, which acts as a primitive operator to support various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to support real-Time decision making. In the experimental study, we use the dataset from SBS Transit as a case study to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies. © 2017 ACM.",Zhang D.; Guo L.; Nie L.; Shao J.; Wu S.; Shen H.T.,Tactical,10.1145/3003725,Mobility pattern; Probabilistic data model; Public transportation systems; Quantitative evaluation; Targeted advertising; User interest,5.0,,15,0,Association for Computing Machinery,"The abstract discusses a probabilistic data model for targeted advertising in public transportation, focusing on ad recommendation and evaluating user influence, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Targeted advertising in public transportation systems with quantitative evaluation,2017
"Social relationships have long been recognised for their role in shaping consumers' opinions and decisions in the traditional offline world. While the number of people participating in online activities and purchases is continuously growing, there is a lack of understanding on whether and how explicitly established social connections might affect product evaluation and adoption in an online environment. Yet, online social relations are notably distinct from their offline counterparts. In this study, using a dataset collected from an online social networking and rating site, we conduct a comparative event analysis around the establishment of online social connections. Our findings provide supporting evidence that explicit online social relations positively influence users' product ratings and play a significant role in expanding a user's product adoption into new product categories over time, which offers important implications for product marketing strategies and design of online recommendation systems.

"Purpose: Despite the remarkable growth of the luxury industry, a phenomenon referred to as luxury fever, as well as the growing interest in word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing in the industry at hand, little is known about how consumers’ perceived leadership of luxury brands dynamically influences their WOM behavior. This paper aims to examine the moderating role of a type of luxuries (accessible vs inaccessible) in the relationship between the four dimensions of perceived brand leadership – quality, value, innovativeness and popularity – and consumers’ WOM recommendation intention. Design/methodology/approach: The current research is based on survey data gathered from 333 actual customers who attend five golf clubs located in North Florida. An innovative data analysis procedure that combines structural equation modeling with propensity score analysis to estimate the moderating effects, controlling for selection bias, is presented. Findings: Quality was the significant predictor of WOM among consumers of inaccessible luxuries (private club). In contrast, financial value and popularity were key factors in predicting WOM of individuals who chose accessible luxuries (public club). Originality/value: This paper attempts to shed new light on the field of strategic luxury marketing by addressing differential consumption decision-making processes corresponding to hierarchically constructed luxury services.

"Consumer return rates have been steadily rising in recent years, resulting in growing costs for retailers who must manage the returns process and the disposition of returned products. This cost pressure is driven in part by extremely generous return policies, such as giving consumers a full refund upon return. Interestingly, this common retail practice of full refunds is inconsistent with the recommendations of many analytical models of returns, which nearly always show that a partial refund is optimal. Such inconsistencies between theory and practice might arise when the decision drivers included in the analytical models do not match the decision drivers in practice. It might also be the case that retailers are overly optimistic about the value that consumers assign to a full refund, and thus assume that the value of such a policy outweighs its costs. In this paper, we use data collected from eBay, where identical products are sold with different return policies, to investigate these open questions in the literature. We analyze both the return policy drivers from the retailer's perspective and the return policy value from the consumer's perspective. Our results suggest that the value of a full refund policy to consumers may not be as large as one might expect, and it also exhibits a large heterogeneity across buyers with different levels of online purchase experience. In addition, we provide empirical evidence for what has long been suspected by online retailers – that a non-refundable forward shipping charge quickly erodes any value that consumers assign to return policies. The generality of our results is limited by the fact that eBay differs from traditional retail contexts in many respects, including the fact that eBay buyers may not be representative of the general buyer population. However, our study of how eBay consumers value free returns provides new insights into an understudied area, and it can serve as a starting point for future studies of the value of return policies in other retail contexts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Shang G.; Pekgün P.; Ferguson M.; Galbreth M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jom.2017.07.001,Consumer returns; eBay; Marketing-operations interface; Online retailing,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses specific return policies and their implications for retailers and consumers, which aligns with tactical decision-making regarding marketing strategies and customer engagement.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,How much do online consumers really value free product returns?

"The literature on referencing takes a firm stance on the value that vendors derive from marketing customer references. What the literature lacks, however, is empirical work that supports our current understanding of the value of customer references to the potential customer. The present exploratory research aims to demonstrate the value of customer references from the perspective of the potential customer. This goal will be achieved by considering a single case study that provides evidence for the value of customer references to potential customers in business markets. Three theoretical propositions emerge as key conceptual contributions: (a) customer references allow buying companies to establish their suppliers’ competence, assess the buying decision risk and forecast return on investment; (b) customer references deliver value by helping potential customers to identify new business needs and (c) potential customers benefit from being exposed to customer references insofar as they are sources of organizational learning.

"The current research aims at revealing the relationship of the brand image, through its dimensions (brand image, confidence in the brand, the commitment towards the brand, the recommendation of the brand towards others), in the involvement with the purchase decision through its dimensions (The mental effort exerted in the search for information, evaluating between the alternatives, and for choosing the preferred brand). The problem of research has identified the main question of the current study, which is ‘What role does the brand image of the brand play in the customer's purchase decision?’ For the purposes of achieving the study objectives, a sample of hypotheses has been formulated. In order to verify the validity of the main hypothesis, several tests were carried out. The researcher used the questionnaire as a means of obtaining data. The study used the analytical descriptive approach as a method of analysis, which is composed of two measures: brand image and purchase involvement. The descriptive method was used to reinforce and strengthen these concepts and to focus on the University students as the largest segment that are concerned with the brands of sportswear. The study was applied to a random sample of 485 university students. The data were analyzed using a set of statistical methods and the results were extracted using statistical program SPSS v.20. The research has reached a number of conclusions, one of the most important of which is that achieving the customer's confidence in the brand is positively guided by the research sample by adopting the customer's confidence that the brand will not deceive him and that he is always at his service. The research has also researched to a number of recommendation, the most important of which is that the marketing managers should convince the customers that the brand has a set of attributes and benefits that can satisfy and meet their needs and aspirations. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

"In diverse social environments, recommendations from others have the power to change consumer behavior. In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from highfamiliarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",Guo F.; Zhang X.; Ding Y.; Wang X.,Operational,10.1037/npe0000051,Event-related potentials; Neural responses; Propensity; Recommendation; Value measurement,10.0,,60,0,American Psychological Association Inc.,"The study focuses on the cognitive processes involved in consumer behavior and recommendations during online shopping, which aligns closely with day-to-day operational decisions and managing consumer interactions.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,Recommendation influence: Differential neural responses of consumers during shopping online,2016
"Purpose: Social media has given customers more power over sharing their knowledge, opinions and experiences with each other.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts the grounded theory approach to analyse interviews conducted in 26 B2B firms representing the UK advertising and marketing sector. Interviewees represent key decision-makers who understand the aspects of mobile technology use in their firms. Eighteen firms stressed the importance of social media as a trigger to adopt mobile devices. Follow-up data collection in these 18 firms focus on strategic orientation, processes, routines and skills required for using MSM. Findings: This paper found that marketing and advertising firms use MSM for branding, sensing market, managing relationships and developing content. MSM is treated by businesses as a strategic firm-specific capability that drives firms’ competitiveness, where imitation of such capability by competitors is limited because MSM skills are specific to individuals within organisations and MSM routines are manifested as a result of firm-specific MSM skills’ interactions. Originality/value: This study is amongst the first to provide insights into B2B firms’ practices of using MSM. Additionally, the research is novel because it discovers that MSM capability is developed as a result of the overlap between individuals’ and organisational knowledge and memory, contradicting existing theory on the subject. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bolat E.; Kooli K.; Wright L.T.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-10-2016-270,Capability approach; Grounded theory; Mobile technology; Social media,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The paper explores how B2B firms use mobile social media (MSM) as a strategic capability that drives competitiveness, emphasizing the long-term implications for the organization in terms of branding, market sensing, and relationship management.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Businesses and mobile social media capability,2016
"Sales management plays an important role in firms' profit. Its main goal is to determine the best time to present insurance customers with prices, insurers, bundling strategies, and the intermediary's recommendation. In this study, a triangular approach was used. For attribute selection, three focus groups were performed with insurance customers and intermediaries. Conjoint analysis was carried out by presenting the attributes in three different orders. Primacy and recency effects were detected; a transfer or anchor effect was also found related to the importance of the attributes preceding and succeeding a given attribute. According to the findings, salespeople can improve their approach to customers by decreasing the importance given to price and increasing the positive impact of bundling strategies and the intermediary's recommendation in sales. Although the order of attribute presentation has previously been analyzed, this is the first study to examine this issue in non-life insurance products, providing useful information to insurance salespeople and marketing managers for a better understanding of insurance customers’ buying decision process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Dominique-Ferreira S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2016.09.013,Bundling strategy; Customer services management; Effects of the order of attribute presentation; Insurance sector; Sales management,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses how sales management can improve strategies for presenting insurance products to customers, focusing on specific methods such as attribute selection and the effects of presentation order.

"Purpose: This paper aims to provide further insight into factors influencing Australian consumers’ purchasing preferences for sparkling wine, including champagne. Design/methodology/approach: Focus groups were conducted and thematic analysis was undertaken to identify factors influencing sparkling wine consumers’ purchasing preferences. Findings: Personal taste was found to influence choice of a sparkling wine rather than another type of beverage, and selection of a particular style and brand of sparkling wine. Country or region of origin was found to be important, often linked to the product being champagne. Brand image, reputation and symbolism were found to influence purchase decisions (sometimes linked to consumption occasion), especially for purchases of gifts. Advice, recommendations and expert reviews, and consumption occasion also were found to influence purchase decisions. Price was found to influence style and brand of sparkling wine purchased. A high price was found to be a barrier for some participants, while other participants were found to avoid sparkling wines priced below some particular level. Thematic analysis enabled development of a preliminary model of purchasing preferences. Research limitations/implications: Being exploratory in nature, findings cannot be generalised. Further studies are required to confirm the preliminary model and to evaluate the validity and significance of proposed relationships. Practical implications: Findings suggest a producer could benefit from marketing a range of sparkling wines to cater to different tastes, occasions and gift purchases. Findings also confirm the importance of marketers pursuing opportunities to obtain and promote favourable expert reviews for their sparkling wines, and of identifying and promoting regional distinctiveness. Originality/value: The first comprehensive model of sparkling wine consumers’ purchasing preferences has been developed.

"Conservation marketing draws upon social marketing and psychology to address the human dimensions of biodiversity loss. Behavioural scientists with expertise in conservation psychology can contribute to the design of research projects in this field that utilize a variety of methodologies (quantitative and qualitative), formal application for approval of methodology and procedure through relevant human and animal research ethics committees, and implementation and evaluation of projects or campaigns that are based on psychological principles of persuasion, attitude, and behavior change with the aim of protecting biodiversity. Interdisciplinary projects utilizing best practice in conservation psychology, community-based social marketing, and conservation marketing are likely to lead to improved outcomes, such as reductions in human consumption patterns and other unsustainable behaviors and increases in community engagement. A closer relationship between conservation psychology and conservation marketing will lead to publications of research in high-impact peer-reviewed journals, offering practical recommendations for conservation practitioners, as well as reaching laypeople. Importantly, communicating successes and failures of different approaches, projects or campaigns will help conservation practitioners, conservation educators, tourism operators, community groups, policy-makers, and other stakeholders make informed decisions and design effective conservation marketing campaigns based on evidence. © 2019, AESS.",Ryan J.C.; Mellish S.; Le Busque B.R.; Litchfield C.A.,Strategic,10.1007/s13412-019-00565-w,Behavioral science; Biodiversity loss; Conservation education; Conservation marketing; Conservation psychology; Social science,5.0,,10,5,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses the long-term goals of conservation marketing and its relationship with conservation psychology, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to achieve sustainable outcomes.

"Aim/Purpose This paper describes an empirical examination of how users' willingness to dis-close personal data is influenced by the amount of information provided on landing pages - standalone web pages created explicitly for marketing or adver-tising campaigns. Background Provision of information is a central construct in the IS discipline. Content is a term commonly used to describe the information made available by a website or other electronic medium. A pertinent debate among scholars and practitioners relate to the behavioral impact of content volume: Specifically, does a greater amount of information elicit engagement and compliance, or the other way around? Methodology A series of large-scale web experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) were conduct-ed employing a between-subjects design and A/B testing. Two variants of land-ing pages, long and short, were created based on relevant behavioral theories. Both variants included an identical form to collect users' information, but dif-ferent amounts of provided content. User traffic was generated using Google AdWords and randomized between the page using Unbounce.com. Relevant usage metrics, such as response rate (called ""conversion rate""), location, and visit time were recorded. Contribution This research contributes to the body of knowledge on information provision and its effectiveness and carries practical and theoretical implications to practi-tioners and scholars in Information Systems, Informing Science, Communica-tions, Digital Marketing, and related fields. Findings Analyses of results show that the shorter landing pages had significantly higher conversion rates across all locations and times. Findings demonstrate a negative correlation between the content amount and consumer behavior, suggesting that users who had less information were more inclined to provide their data. Recommendations for Practitioners At a practical level, results can empirically support business practices, design considerations, and content strategy by informing practitioners on the role of content in online commerce. Recommendation for Researchers Findings suggest that the amount of content plays a significant role in online decision making and effective informing. They also contradict prior research on trust, persuasion, and security. This study advances research on the paradoxical relationship between the increased level of information and online decision-making and indicates that contrary to earlier work, not all persuasion theories are effective online. Impact on Society Understanding how information drives behavior has implications in many do-mains (civic engagement, health, education, and more). This has relevance to system design and public communication in both online and offline contexts. Future Research Using this research as a starting point, future research can examine the impact of content in other contexts, as well as other behavioral drivers (such as demo-graphic data). This can lead to theoretical, methodological, and practical rec-ommendations. © 2018 Informing Science Institute.",Dvir N.; Gafni R.,Tactical,10.28945/4015,Consumer behavior; Content strategy; Deci-sion making; E-commerce; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Informing science; Marketing; User engagement,5.0,,15,0,Informing Science Institute,"The research focuses on how the amount of information on landing pages affects user behavior and data disclosure, which aligns with structured decision-making in marketing campaigns and user engagement strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,When less is more: Empirical study of the relation between consumer behavior and information provision on commercial landing pages,2018
"This paper shares the details of an evaluation plan from an interdisciplinary climate change project that developed decision support tools (DSTs) DST = Decision Support Tool. 2 for agricultural advisors and farmers. It showcases how evaluation enhanced the project work by providing opportunities for the team to reflect on and use data to improve performance. The plan included both formative and summative approaches, team member interviews to assess team functioning, usability testing of DSTs, outreach and marketing campaign evaluation. Outreach evaluation included surveying those reached, monitoring project website traffic, and tracking and mapping outreach details. Marketing evaluation included pre-testing campaign materials, assessing open and click rates of email campaign, and monitoring associated traffic to website. The Useful to Usable (U2U) team was generally high functioning, but team interviews allowed the evaluators and leaders to discern factors that were influencing intended outcomes, respond to needs, assign resources, and catalyze activities that were crucial in shaping the outcomes. Usability testing surfaced issues related to default values and search and help features that were addressed by the team and resulted in improved usability. Outreach evaluation found geographic and methodological gaps that were filled, resulting in more target audiences reached and more effective methods used (e.g., hands-on events). Marketing evaluation allowed for improving contact lists over time and improving campaign messaging before deployment. Evaluators and project leaders working on similar projects may adapt or utilize methods detailed in this paper, along with the recommendations, while designing and implementing improvement-oriented evaluation plans. © 2016 The Authors",Klink J.; Koundinya V.; Kies K.; Robinson C.; Rao A.; Berezowitz C.; Widhalm M.; Prokopy L.,Tactical,10.1016/j.crm.2016.11.003,Interdisciplinary team; Marketing campaign; Mixed methods evaluation; Outreach evaluation; Stakeholder engagement; Usability testing,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of decision support tools and the methods used to improve project performance, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on structured approaches and specific targets like usability testing and outreach evaluation.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Enhancing interdisciplinary climate change work through comprehensive evaluation,2017
"Innovative marketers can now leverage augmented reality to craft immersive brand experiences, create more interactive advertising, and enable consumers to experience products and spaces in novel ways. Augmented reality (AR) is the practice of displaying digital information over people's real-time view of objects, people, or spaces in the physical world. While AR can play a valuable role in integrated marketing programs, little is known about the practice and how to execute effective AR programs in the marketplace. We address this gap by presenting a framework that describes the active and passive ingredients of augmented reality. We then describe the basic design decisions that marketers need to make when planning an augmented reality campaign. In addition, we explain how understanding and addressing the dynamics between various active and passive AR ingredients can help marketers to optimize their AR campaigns and enhance various types of consumer engagement: user-brand engagement, user-user engagement, and user-bystander engagement. Through our framework and analysis, we develop eight actionable recommendations-described with the acronym ENTANGLE-marketing managers can use to design immersive AR experiences that maximize consumer engagement. © 2015 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.",Scholz J.; Smith A.N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.bushor.2015.10.003,Advertising; Augmented reality; Branding; Consumer engagement; Interactive marketing; Mobile marketing; Social media; User-generated content; Virtual reality,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of augmented reality (AR) in marketing, focusing on specific design decisions and actionable recommendations to enhance consumer engagement.

"Purpose: This research aims to predict private club members’ intentions to switch service providers based on the benefit exchange theory through a structural model with a second-order factor. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative procedure to develop a functional, social and psychological model based on the benefit exchange and switching intention literatures. A further quantitative analysis surveyed a sample of 366 private club members and assessed the usefulness of this model. Findings: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling indicate that social benefits have a stronger impact on switching intention than loss of functional benefits under the context of a high level of interaction between members and between members and service providers. In addition, they confirm the moderating effects of psychological benefits on the relationship between functional benefits and switching intention. Practical implications: The findings indicate that members are unlikely to switch if there are positive word of mouth and interpersonal interactions between members and the club (social benefits). Even if they are disappointed with the functional benefits of the club’s products or services, they may still choose to stay with it owing to psychological benefits affecting their decision to switch. The findings offer managerial insights into utilizing relationship marketing activities to strengthen interpersonal relationships, word of mouth, trust, commitment and emotional factors to retain members. Originality/value: This research confirms that the benefit exchange theory can explain members’ intentions to switch from their current clubs and provides valuable recommendations to managers on retaining their clubs’ members. Because the switching intentions of club members have not previously been adequately studied, this study fills an important gap in the literature. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Chuang Y.-F.; Tai Y.-F.,Strategic,10.1108/IJCHM-10-2014-0514,Benefit exchange; Consumer behavior; Hospitality; Membership; Private club; Switching intention,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The research focuses on understanding and predicting private club members' intentions to switch service providers, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and member retention strategies.

"Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM) programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide them valuable assistance in doing so. The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network-level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1 ) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Chica M.; Rand W.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.15.0443,Agent-based modeling; Freemium business model; Marketing decision support systems; Targeting and referrals; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract describes a decision support system (DSS) designed to assist marketers in implementing word-of-mouth (WOM) programs and optimizing premium conversions through data-driven targeting and reward policies.

"In an attempt to market their services and connect with potential users, and particularly young people, many libraries are opening accounts on social media platforms. Research suggests a contradiction between the advice relating to marketing and that regarding the use of social media in libraries, with the former emphasising the importance of the user at the centre of all considerations and the latter placing library staff as central to decisions. In this work we attempt to re-address this imbalance by surveying the current state of library activity on Twitter and, by means of questionnaires, investigate the experiences and motivations of librarians (n=58) in using social media and whether students (n=498) are willing to engage with the library in this manner and why.

"Successful crowdfunding campaigns are multifaceted in nature and depend on marketing and organizational features. This study identifies the most appealing factors and analyzes the results through a multi-theory approach as follows. First, contrary to altruism and warm-glow giving theories, crowdfunding to support social impact projects does not perform well. Second, fixed campaigns, small-sized projects, and prolonged campaigns are more likely to be funded, in line with goal-setting theory. Additionally, the resource-based view of firms clarifies the importance of having large entrepreneurial teams. Further, narrative theories about persuasion and information processing provide insights into why detailed text descriptions are more persuasive than pitch videos.

"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship among jurors’ attribution of responsibility of the error, patient styles and juror decisions (e.g. acquittal of the physician). Specifically, this research examines the influence of an individual’s approach to their healthcare (active vs. passive), and decisions to acquit in malpractice cases. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 459 individuals were surveyed using a commercial call center for participation in a corresponding mail survey. Surveys were also distributed to undergraduate business students at a Midwestern university. Findings: Cluster analysis revealed two categories of patient styles: “active patients” (39.4 per cent) and “passive patients” (60.6 per cent). Regardless of patient style, this research found all respondents viewed medical error disclosure as important. However, respondents in the passive group were more likely to acquit the physician and the hospital nursing staff as compared with those classified as active. Practical implications: The safety of patients in the healthcare system and prevention of errors is a critical issue. However, when errors occur, medical providers should disclose information to the patient and take responsibility to attenuate their negative impact. Further, this research reveals that patients who rely more on their physicians, trust their recommendations and question physicians less are more likely to acquit. Medical providers can use this information as motivation to continue to build this type of trust with their patients. Originality/value: Medical errors are costly for all parties involved.

"Naming a product's scent is a key decision. The same scent can be interpreted differently when different names are assigned to it. Thus, choosing the right scent name can increase competitiveness by successfully appealing to desired consumer segments. We propose that such decisions should be data driven (i.e., on the basis of competitors’ offerings and consumers’ preferences) and provide guidelines on how to assign scent names to products in home care and personal care product categories, focusing on capturing market segments. Based on a large web-based dataset of scented products across multiple brands and categories, this article is the first to construct a typology of scent names empirically: unscented, concrete, abstract, and proprietary. After examining firms’ assortments of scented products with different names across 12 categories and comparing them with consumers’ preferences concerning such assortments, we identify major gaps. Overall, consumers demand far more unscented products and products with abstract names than currently offered; however, preferences for products with proprietary names are mostly aligned.

Consumer segmentation is a marketing strategy which involves firstly dividing customers into groups based on their underlying characteristics, needs and interests, and then designing and implementing strategies to target them. One of the most common types of segmentation approaches is behavioural segmentation analysis in which consumers are grouped based on their certain behavioural characteristics such as decision making, spending, usage, etc. This study carried out behavioural segmentation analysis based on real e-commerce transaction records of 10,000 online customers and found five different types of online consumer segments which are opportunist customers, transient customers, need-based shoppers, skeptical newcomers and repetitive purchasers. Behavioural characteristics of each segment were discussed in detail and recommendations were made about how to approach to each segment in order to increase their online shopping rates.

"Due to the sweeping influence of capitalism, most food processing is now done through standardized production workflows in order to quickly replicate and churn out a large quantity of products. This has led to an increasing number of homogenized and delocalized products flooding the market and a disconnection between consumers and local food producers. Penghu outlying island is rich in unique local agricultural products but seriously lacks brand images and channel strategies, as manifested in an unstable demand and supply, a high degree of homogeneity (in products) and the majority of farmers producing and selling their products autonomously. This study applies the local food system and actor-network theory as the basis of theoretical frameworks as well as agricultural practices in Penghu as the research object. We used field investigation, in-depth interview and the means-end chain method to examine important contextual factors' influence on the local agricultural food system, important actors and challenges and key influential factors for local brand value that affect the development of the local agricultural food system in Penghu outlying island. The actor-network perceptual map of local brand value proposed in this study can help agricultural practitioners when making decisions and can formulate strategies for their products to increase the product visibility and recognition. This perceptual map can also facilitate the expansion of the target customers and channel distributions suitable for individual agricultural products. Our study presents the following recommendations: increase the manpower of agricultural practices through the working holiday approach; local government should provide support enabling agriculture producers to gain professional knowledge in marketing; and agriculture producers should form cooperatives which focus on the unique local agricultural products that are produced and marketed locally in Penghu. © 2018 by the authors.",Tang J.-W.; Chen M.-L.; Chiu T.-H.,Tactical,10.3390/su10114186,Actor-network theory; Local brand value; Local food system; Outlying island agriculture,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses specific strategies for improving the local agricultural food system in Penghu, including recommendations for brand value enhancement and marketing practices.

"Many successful companies spend substantial time and effort engaging with potential consumers on social media sites. They determine how consumers spend their time online and develop interesting content to increase awareness and enjoyment of the brand—often only to lose those potential customers because the purchase process becomes too difficult once consumers have decided to buy the product. New technology recently introduced by third-party vendors allows companies to offer a sales option directly on social media websites such as Facebook and Instagram. In this article, we present the effects on the consumer decision process created by the ‘Buy Now’ option across the consideration, evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase stages. We compare and contrast three distinct decision models: (1) traditional media only, (2) traditional media and social media with only a communication capability, and (3) traditional media and social media with the added function of immediate purchase. We argue that though the possibility of buying on social media will decrease the number of brands considered and evaluated, the number of purchases and amount of brand advocacy will increase significantly due to the ease of purchase. We conclude with some recommendations on future research. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Lindsey-Mullikin J.; Borin N.,Tactical,10.1016/j.bushor.2017.03.005,Brand social media; Consumer decision-making process; Digital marketing; Retail social media; Social media sales,5.0,,20,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a 'Buy Now' option on social media, which aligns with tactical decision-making to optimize the consumer purchase process and enhance user engagement.

"Despite the rise of emerging markets as lucrative destinations for business expansion, marketing literature in this area is largely anecdotal and conceptual. Further, owing to the largely unorganized retail structure in emerging markets, managers tend to make sub-optimal marketing-mix decisions by taking an aggregate view of their distribution network. In this study, we develop an econometric model to help firms develop a multichannel distribution strategy in emerging markets while accounting for (a) own-marketing mix, (b) competitive actions, (c) brand-level heterogeneity, and (d) dependencies that may arise between product offerings. The proposed model is tested on longitudinal data from a large Indian CPG manufacturer. The results indicate that firms must consider store format-specific distribution elasticities (as opposed to aggregate effects), especially in an emerging market, where the role of distribution is critical in brand success. Further, depending on the offering, price (own- and cross-) and advertising elasticities could vary even though the brand is essentially the same. Also, we find that there are significant dependencies between product forms that need to be considered when designing the marketing mix. Finally, we provide re-allocation recommendations to help managers choose the level of store format distribution in order to maximize profits. The proposed distribution re-allocation strategy resulted in an average of 7.7% increase in profits across three product forms for the focal firm. © 2014.",Kumar V.; Sunder S.; Sharma A.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretai.2014.08.005,Distribution elasticity; Emerging markets; Marketing mix; Multichannel retailing; Product forms; Store formats,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on developing a multichannel distribution strategy and suggests re-allocation recommendations for managers, which are tactical decisions that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Leveraging Distribution to Maximize Firm Performance in Emerging Markets,2015
"Net Promoter Score, touted as the “single customer metric you need” and calculated from customers' answer to one simple question about their loyalty, has been in use since 2003 and adopted in a wide variety of settings. However, it has not lived up to its claimed benefits. This article evaluates the NPS approach in terms of its positive and negative results. This article is for people interested in NPS, still considering implementing NPS in their company, or interested in its technical underpinnings. It points out the benefits and shortcomings and explains why, and it describes what can be done to achieve the outcomes NPS theory claimed it would produce, but has not. The article is written in two parts for quite distinct audiences: firstly, for executives and managers who need customer data and information to make marketing decisions; and secondly, for market researchers, statisticians, and business analysts who are responsible for capturing and providing reliable, understandable, and meaningful customer data to the executives and managers who need the information. Consequently, the two sections are written in two different styles. The first section takes the form of a summary for managers and executives of our findings and recommendations in language aimed at business leaders; the second section provides a detailed analysis and critical review of NPS for market researchers, statisticians, and business analysts. Both sections present a better solution than NPS for understanding what customers value, delivering the best value to customers, winning market share, and creating truly loyal customers. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Fisher N.I.; Kordupleski R.E.,Strategic,10.1002/asmb.2417,Customer Value Management; market research; satisfaction surveys; transaction surveys,5.0,,10,5,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"The article evaluates the Net Promoter Score (NPS) approach and discusses its long-term implications for understanding customer loyalty and making marketing decisions, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making at the organizational level.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Good and bad market research: A critical review of Net Promoter Score,2019

"Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the United States are facing turbulent environments that include increased accountability and assessment measures, competition, state mandates, declining budgets, changes in the classroom and pedagogical landscape, and diminutive endowments. These factors are further heightened by an ongoing debate regarding the relevance of HBCUs and a paradigm shift that calls for more entrepreneurial-based leadership in the decision-making process and business-based strategies aimed at institutional survival. However, HBCU leadership, which often ascends from the faculty ranks, does not possess the business degrees or marketing experience that would equip them for the evolving and complex demands of the higher education marketplace.

"We use a general cellular automata model to study the consumer decision-making process. Within this general model we use three different rules governing word-of-mouth communication (w-o-m), one majority rule and two unanimity rules, and ask the question if differences between these three w-o-m rules, introduced on the microscopic level, will manifest on the macroscopic level. We show that in the model with the majority rule the neighborhood plays a significant role in terms of the market shares whereas movement (interpreted as seeking for information in other sources) is almost negligible. Exactly the opposite phenomena are observed for models in which unanimity, instead of majority, is needed to convince agents. We also introduce a modification of the unanimity rule, based on the Latane theory of the social influence, and show that on the macroscopic level this modification is indistinguishable from the simple unanimity rule. We conclude the paper with a recommendation which rules are more appropriate to model particular marketing phenomena. © 2016, University of Surrey.

"In recent years, word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing has been the subject of considerable interest among managers and academics alike. However, there is very little common knowledge on what drives the value of WOM programs and how they should be designed to optimize value. Firms therefore frequently rely on relatively simple metrics to measure the success of their WOM marketing efforts and mainly use rules of thumb when making crucial program design decisions. This article proposes a new method to measure WOM program value that is based on the impact of WOM on the firm’s customer equity. It then provides recommendations for the five main questions managers face when planning a WOM program: Who to target? When to launch the program? Where to launch it?

"Using conservation tourism as a test case, this study explores the role high-end travel agents play in selling sustainable tourism. It examines a niche marketing activity in that process. The study focuses on agents’ consideration of ethics as they act as information brokers between tourists and operators. Data were collected from interviews with agents and analysed using a deductive content analysis based on six overarching concepts and theories on ethical decision-making. The findings emphasize the implicit influence within conservation tourism of tourism's ethical dimensions, whilst identifying many constraints that prevent a full consideration and/or disclosure of ethical concerns in the sales process. Most importantly, agents made assumptions using a false consensus bias about clients' preferences for service over concerns for the environment, and were not prepared to discuss the more sensitive issues surrounding conservation with their clients. A number of recommendations are proposed regarding the need to unpack conservation information, overcome the false consensus bias, and agents’ reluctance to discuss ethics in the sales process. Finally, the findings have broader implications for the development of sustainable tourism, which ultimately will depend on a dialogue of ethical concerns and values within the tourism supply chain between suppliers, brokers and tourists. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Mossaz A.; Coghlan A.,Tactical,10.1080/09669582.2016.1198358,Conservation; ethical decision-making; marketing; travel agents,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on the role of high-end travel agents in selling sustainable tourism, which involves structured decisions and considerations regarding marketing strategies and client interactions.

"In settings characterized by frequent product entries and rapid market exit, predicting innovation success is a difficult task. The challenge in such short life-cycle markets is exacerbated when the offering is an experience good (i.e., product quality is not known prior to consumption). This article investigates a variety of information disequilibrium-reducing cues that can signal a new product's quality, and posit that those cues affect knowledge of and attitude toward (i.e., customers' mindset) the item, and in turn, demand. The work draws on signaling theory in an experience good context (motion pictures) to set up a nomological net that includes three sources of quality cues as predictors of consumer demand, namely: (i) traditional prelaunch decisions (e.g., production budget, advertising budget, and sequel), (ii) volume and valence of movie critics' reviews, and (iii) text contained in the movie critics' reviews. Based on a stratified, random sample of movie introductions (n = 115), the results show that the prelaunch (structured numeric) variables alone explain a meaningful proportion of the variance in domestic box office sales. The postlaunch (structured numeric) variables, volume and valence of critics' reviews, add more explanatory power, and analyzing over two million words from the (unstructured) text of critics' reviews adds further explanatory power. This research answers a recent call to model the variety of structured and unstructured variables to predict innovation success in data-rich environments, and thereby represents the pioneering study to combine all three sources of quality cues—(i) prelaunch, structured variables; (ii) postlaunch, structured variables; and (iii) postlaunch, unstructured variables derived from text reviews—as determinants of demand. The approach taken also substantiates film as innovation and as an interesting case of new product development. For managers in a short life-cycle, experience good settings, the results support the inclusion of a broader “variety” of quality signals to improve forecasting in today's data-rich environments. Practitioner Points: The results here highlight the importance of considering both marketing decisions and expert reviews in forecasting approaches for new product launches. Exploring a nuanced approach to analyzing expert reviews seems to be particularly promising in predicting product successes and failures. This research also helps us develop a deeper understanding of the nature of critics' reviews. Beyond just “thumbs up/thumbs down” sort of recommendations, we identify specific words that are influential in making an impression on consumers and, ultimately, driving product success or failure. This work also emphasizes the challenges of predicting success in markets for short life-cycle experience goods such as films. In these markets, expert reviews likely carry even more weight since consumers have great difficulty in assessing the product in advance. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",Bharadwaj N.; Noble C.H.; Tower A.; Smith L.M.; Dong Y.,Strategic,10.1111/jpim.12404,,5.0,,10,0,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of understanding consumer demand and innovation success in short life-cycle markets, particularly in the context of predicting outcomes based on various quality cues.

"The development of modern economy highlights the role and importance of information factor while making managerial decisions especially in the sphere of marketing activity of any organisation. Under such circumstances the problem of forming effective marketing information systems is becoming crucially important for Russian organisations. Marketing analysis is rather poor in modern Russian economy mainly because the history of Russian market economy is not so long and the analysis does not have enough bases of historical statistics data during the «new era» of functioning of Russian economy. Marketing information systems based on new technologies of processing and synthesising of information flows might improve the situation.

"For two decades, fair trade has served as an alternative approach of trading that encourages minimal returns, sustainability, and ethics, by offering producers in developing countries better trading conditions and secured rights. This movement has emerged recently in China, with companies involving domestic trading between richer and poorer regions. However, lack of third-party certification, standardization, process control, public awareness, and brand recognition continue to be challenges. To understand the current fair trade business in China, this paper investigates important decision-making areas from a supply chain management perspective. With the nature of empirical studies, an in-depth case analysis of a fair trade craft company has been conducted along with the purchasing and supplier relationship management, internal operations, and marketing and customer relationship management. This company currently combines the role of fair trade organization and retailer, by implementing an in-house certification system and vertically integrating the supply chain. Findings also highlight risk at each stage of supply chain. Compared with the western society, the unique features of Chinese fair trade business are captured with prioritized areas for improvement. This research contributes to the fair trade literature by providing exploratory study into emerging issues in the supply chain, particularly inside developing countries.

"In this article we examine the possibility of using geomarketing as a tool for modeling the spatial location of a bank’s offices serving individuals and legal entities. Geomarketing is a marketing concept of modern production management based on geo-information technologies which involves the use of spatially localized information to support decision-making. This concept is particularly timely for commercial banks which present their services to customers in an extensive network of service offices, because for the majority of banking services the determining factor in the consumer’s choice of bank for a given service will be the convenience of the location of its office. The article describes a sequence of typical steps in geomarketing simulations and makes recommendations for the implementation of each selected stage. Methodical approaches to the implementation of geomarketing modeling for an optimal network of the bank’s service offices are highlighted. Problems in the organization of the network of service offices of the bank which can be solved with the help of geomarketing design are studied. Recommendations are presented for evaluating the capacity of a commercial bank’s office service network depending on their specialization in serving individuals or legal entities. An algorithm is presented for calculating the service office network capacity for individuals together with respective formulas. An approach to evaluating the capacity of the office network servicing legal entities is described.

"Purpose: This study aims to describe South African consumers’ wine risk perception on varietal level with recommendations for Chenin blanc. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory mixed methods approach was followed where qualitative data were used to develop the questionnaire. Quantitative data were collected from 2,051 respondents using an online survey. ANOVA and Fischer least significance difference tests were used to indicate statistical significance. Findings: Significant perceived risks (PRs) associated with Chenin blanc across age and ethnic groups were functional, time and financial risks. Risk-reducing strategies (RRS) in the white wine category were favourite brands and a trusted store, while Sauvignon blanc was also described as an RRS. Recommended Chenin blanc RRS include tastings and events with food. Research limitations/implications: Measurement of PR remains challenging.

"The conditions of the functioning of state higher education institutions at the present stage of development of the Ukrainian economy require new approaches to solve the problem of the relationship between the volume of training of specialists with higher education and their employment in the sphere of economic activity. The purpose of this article was to provide theoretical substantiation and practical recommendations for the development of a higher education institution development strategy for making managerial innovative decisions on balancing the demand and supply of educational services in a competitive environment. The following methods were used in the study: abstract logical; comparative economic and system structural; statistical; sociological; modeling; the algorithm of practical application of the theory of constraints of systems; and the apparatus of the theory of fuzzy sets. Methodological approaches to the implementation of the optimal allocation of budget places of the university by means of a practical application of system restriction theory and fuzzy set theory were proposed. The result was the allocation of budgetary places, taking into account the demand for specialties in terms of the economic situation of the region, the demand in the labor market, the demand among entrants, and the proposal of the institution of higher education and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. It will make it possible to reach the optimum balance between demand for specialists in specific specialties and their supply.

Value indicators were defined as conspicuous or inconspicuous. Conspicuous indicators include corporate advertising, such as the vineyard, region or brand, and are considered the same (or equal) for all recipients. Inconspicuous indicators are less visible and may differ from recipient to recipient, such as referrals. Purchasing occasions are either home (personal and private) or restaurant consumption (personal and public) or as a gift (impersonal and public). Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was used to understand the changing importance of value indicators based on differing purchase goals. The snowball sample was comprised of marketing professionals, who are highly educated and likely to be of prime working age (25-55 years). Initial participants were then asked to forward the email invitation to their networks. The majority of the 298 survey respondents were Australian-born and described themselves as Anglo-Saxon. Findings: Conspicuous indicators, such as advertising, are given more consideration for impersonal consumption experiences such as gifts or to drink in public. Less conspicuous, but more trustworthy, indicators, (personal recommendations), are more important for personal consumption experiences. These results offer insight into the indicators of product value that marketers could emphasise in their marketing mixes to target consumers buying with different purchase goals in mind and seek new markets. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited in geographical selection, and the methodology comprised an online survey. The nature of the purchase contexts was deliberately kept broad to highlight the overall impact of value indicators. Originality/value: While there have been some studies centering on wine purchase and consumption in different situations, direct comparisons between contexts are rare. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by comparing consumer behaviour across wine purchase contexts. The value of this paper stems from deepening understanding of the role of context in purchase decision-making and the implications for marketing practitioners and clearly identified opportunities for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dobele A.R.; Greenacre L.; Fry J.,Tactical,10.1108/IJWBR-07-2016-0021,Online survey; Purchase context; Purchase indicators; Seemingly unrelated regression; Value judgements; Wine marketing,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The paper examines the impact of purchasing occasions on product value indicators, providing insights that can inform marketing strategies and decisions related to targeting consumers based on different purchasing contexts.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,The impact of purchase goal on wine purchase decisions,2018

"Introduction. In the conditions of continuous change and bifurcations of the marketing environment, the system of management of marketing commodity policy (SMMCP) of online retailers is impacted by a set of immanent components, the inclusion of which makes it possible to multiply the efficiency of their functioning in the cyber space and timely adjust the plan to implement marketing activities. In this regard, the urgency in substantiating, systematising the immanent components (quantitative measurement) and developing practical principals relevant to the assessment of the impact of such components on the SMMCP of online retailers based on the use of a multidimensional simulation method is becoming more relevant. The purpose of this article is to develop canonical models for assessing the impact of partial immanent components (quantitative measurement) on the SMMCP of online retailers, taking into account the corresponding latent root causes. In order to automate calculations and construct canonical models, the authors of the article use the demo version of the «STATISTICA» software package. Results. The author of the article has substantiated and systematised the immanent components and their impact on the SMMCP of online retailers (quantitative measurement), as well as the root causes of the formation of the SMMCP of online retailers that determine the partial immanent components of impact, and explained the correlation between the corresponding attributes, giving their meaningful interpretation. Consequently, canonical models for assessing of partial immanent components of impact on the SMMCP of online retailers, the implementation of which is the basis for making effective marketing decisions and achievement of corresponding goals by applying managerial impact locally. Conclusion. The approbation of the developed canonical models has allowed the author to single out three groups of online retailers and formulate practical recommendations with regard to further implementation of marketing activities. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.",Natorina A.,Strategic,10.21003/ea.V174-11,Canonical models; Immanent components of influence; Latent root causes; Management system of marketing commodity policy (MSMCP); Online retailers,5.0,,10,0,Institute of Society Transformation,"The abstract focuses on developing canonical models for assessing the impact of various components on the marketing commodity policy of online retailers, which involves long-term planning and strategic decision-making.

"Today's more “mindful” consumers’ food consumption decisions are changing as they attempt to balance egoistic and altruistic motivations. This study explores the relative importance of these types of motivations in influencing Australian consumers’ attitudes towards, and purchase frequency of, local food. Factors examined include ethical self-identity, environmental consciousness, health consciousness and food safety. Results indicate egoistic motivations may influence local food consumption decisions more strongly than altruistic motivations. Recommendations for producers and retailers of local food in appealing to more “mindful” consumers suggest more focused marketing and communication strategies, clearer branding and labelling of produce, and training of service staff. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Birch D.; Memery J.; De Silva Kanakaratne M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.10.013,Egoistic and altruistic motivations; Environmental consciousness; Ethical self-identity; Food safety; Health consciousness; Local food,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses consumer attitudes and behaviors regarding local food consumption, focusing on specific motivations and factors that influence purchasing decisions.

"Purpose – Primarily, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the interaction and direct effects of tie strength between sender and receiver of word of mouth (WOM) and the receiver’s service purchase decision involvement on WOM influence. A secondary aim is to investigate how a distinctive conceptualization of perceived risk, consisting of two types (outcome risk and psychosocial risk), affects service purchase decision involvement. A conceptual model incorporating these constructs and associated hypotheses is developed and tested. Design/methodology/approach – In a survey of actual service consumers, respondents were asked to recall a recent instance where they had received service purchase information via WOM, and relate their responses to this instance. Established scales were used to measure the constructs. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings – Principally, findings demonstrate a strong interaction effect between service purchase decision involvement and tie strength. Also, results highlight the complexity of the perceived risk construct, suggesting that it is appropriately modeled as two types: outcome risk, and psychosocial risk. Research limitations/implications – This research has contributed to the service marketing literature by testing a model that predicts WOM influence. Evidence confirmed that the effect of service purchase decision involvement on WOM influence is moderated by tie strength. Additionally, a conceptualization of two different types of risk associated with purchase decisions was suggested, together with empirical confirmation of their hypothesized antecedent effects on service purchase decision involvement. Findings have special implications for the literatures of persuasion, social and interpersonal influence, as well as consumer behavior in general. Practical implications – To harness the power of WOM, managers should understand who their target audience is and how consumers are related to each other (tie strength) and to the service purchase decision (service purchase decision involvement). Recommendations are made with specific illustrations of how firms can leverage tie strength under conditions of low service purchase decision involvement to enhance WOM influence. Originality/value – The formidable power of WOM wields substantial influence on consumers, particularly within a service (vs goods) purchase context, typically characterized by higher perceived risk and lower search qualities. The significant interaction between tie strength and service purchase decision involvement is a unique contribution to the service WOM literature. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Voyer P.A.; Ranaweera C.,Tactical,10.1108/JSTP-04-2014-0070,Influence; Involvement; Risk; Service purchase decision; Tie strength; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the interaction of word of mouth (WOM) influence with specific variables such as tie strength and service purchase decision involvement, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.

"The purpose of this research is to study consumer attitude towards mobile advertising in Malaysia, and whether this attitude results in the intention to purchase the products or services advertised. This article reports on the results, based on factors such as entertainment, informativeness, irritation and credibility, which the research framework derives from Ducoffe (1996, Advertising value and advertising on the Web, Journal of Advertising Research, 36(5), 21–35) and Mackenzie (1989, An empirical examination of the structural antecedents of attitude toward the ad in an advertising pretesting context, Journal of Marketing, 53(4), 48–65). Attitudes towards behaviours, and subjective norms, based on the research by Ajzen (1991, The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behaviour & Human Decision Processes, 50(2), 179–211), are included in understanding consumer intention. A survey is conducted on 150 respondents, and the partial least squares analysis is used to determine the antecedents of mobile advertising that lead to consumer acceptance of mobile advertising, and the resulting intention to purchase. Results show that the advertising message content has the largest impact on attitude in advertising that is done via mobile phone. Attitudes towards mobile advertising are linked to the intention to purchase the product or services advertised. The main implication of the study shows that marketing managers should focus their marketing communication on mobile advertising, and increasing the attractiveness of this form of advertising, so as to reflect consumers’ intention to purchase. This study opens a new channel of communication for multiple unexamined matters concerning the mobile advertising industry.

"Objectives Despite being a strategic sector of Galician's economy, the dairy sector has been traditionally characterized by its small-scale. This factor can inhibit the competitive potential of the companies operating in this area, mainly cooperatives. This paper provides an overview of the steps taken towards the consolidation of a second-degree cooperative known as CLUN -Cooperativas Lácteas Unidas. This process, taken together with a new merger (Aira, SCG) redefines the agrarian cooperative sector as well as the Galician dairy one. We start by providing a brief analysis of the dairy sector in Spain and Galicia to depict the general context in which this study is undertook. Then, we outline the setting up of CLUN as a concentration process on the Galician agrarian sector. We analyze both the former companies which jointly manage the second-degree one, and the different stages carried out. Next, we identify the major remaining changes to be resolved on the medium term and the main conclusions of the process. Finally, we set up several recommendations regarding the success of this process and other similar consolidations. Taken this into account, our main objective is to further the study in the role of the size and the concentration processes on the competitiveness of cooperatives, shedding light on the main factors that can might improve -or inhibit- these processes. In sum, we aim to analyze the threats and opportunities that mergers generate when are implemented, and to provide information about some factors that can improve the opportunities towards a successful concentration. Method In order to accomplish our goals, we used a mixed method. First, a review of the main indicators of the agrarian cooperatives -both in Spain and Galicia- has been conducted. This enables us to contextualize our study. Second, we conducted a broad review on the academic literature related to this field, focusing on both those papers that highlight the importance of the size of cooperatives on competitiveness and those that carried out research on concentration processes. Finally, we introduce some issues that suggest the convenience of using a qualitative approach. More specifically, we aim to obtain some information about the business-case as perceived by its internal stakeholders. In this respect, some managers were interviewed to identify the main factors they found interesting related to the topic. Results Since the first consolidated income statement has not been approved to date, it is early to determine the financial success of the integration process. However, it is possible to identify some of the factors that have been traditionally related to the competitiveness of agro-food companies: size, diversification and market orientation. Therefore, it might be suggested that the CLUN's creation represents a daring commitment to improve the competitiveness on the dairy sector. In addition, we can highlight several practices that seem to favor the implementation. Some of them are related to the idiosyncrasy of the organizations, while others arose as a result of the procedures implemented along the integration. In the first place, although the three former companies were linked on their corporate object, the different specialization's focuses make them complementary. Thus, Feiraco plays a leading role in marketing and distribution; Os Irmandiños in the manufacture of feed and Melisanto has an important portfolio of services for its members. This complementarity helped, for example, to avoid the transfer of personnel and to facilitate the establishment of the decision centers at headquarters. Secondly, we would like to highlight the background on organizational knowledge that the three cooperatives had among themselves, since they had previously shared business in recent years. This mutual knowledge leads to improve the opportunities to undertake merger' processes in a natural way and to overcome in turn possible frictions. This circumstance, taken together with the coincidence on the company kind and also with the observance of the principles of the Corporate Governance within cooperatives, seems to suggest that they have similar business cultures. This factor is crucial for the success of any concentration process, since that in addition to the financial and organizational adjustment social alignment is essential. Therefore, the combination of a similar business culture and a coordinated management team can help in the successful accomplishment of the integration. However, we claim the need to advance in the equalization of rights, obligations and benefits among workers, in order to reduce some risks in the integration. Finally, it should be noted that there was a common choice of the external and independent stakeholder for the realization of the valuation proposal and subsequent determination of the percentage of participation of each organization in the resulting entity. In this way, a process that could be a source of conflict is carried out in a widely accepted way. In future research it would be interesting to analyze whether these factors could be hierarchized, and also if there are significant differences between the different stakeholders that have participated in the concentration. Namely, if managers of cooperatives have opinions that are statistically different from those provided by workers or external stakeholders. In addition, it could be explored whether types of factors could be established. For instance, social, organizational and financial ones. Contribution This work helps to increase the existing evidence about concentration processes in cooperatives. This kind of business have proven to be a successful way to reduce the unemployment. In addition, they have showed to be able to maintain a certain amount anticyclic behavior in order to survive on financial crisis. But to improve their opportunity of succeeding, they still need to implement strategies to favor their competitiveness. Our results show that effort has to be placed mainly in concentration but keeping in mind that It is important for members to learn how to handle problems and potential clashes using the right practices. It should be noted that CLUN operates as a first-degree cooperative since January of 2019. This suggests that these corporate restructuring processes seem to be very active in Galicia, which highlights the convenience of monitoring them. Further initiatives int this respect might raise the level of consciousness towards the importance of societal dimension to sharpen the competitiveness of companies working in this field. © 2012 Universitat de València.",Domínguez M.B.; Blanco A.O.; Márquez M.C.,Strategic,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.96.12915,Business concentration; CLUN; Cooperatives; Dairy sector; Galicia; Merger; Social economy,5.0,,10,5,CIRIEC,"The abstract discusses long-term goals and the strategic consolidation of cooperatives to enhance competitiveness in the dairy sector, which aligns with the definition of strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,CLUN: A business-case of concentration by merger of three dairy cooperatives at Galicians agrarian cooperatives; [CLUN: Concentración por fusión de tres cooperativas lácteas en el cooperativismo agrario en Galicia],2019
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of social commerce constructs (SCCs), social support and relationship quality on social commerce intentions, which lead to use behaviour of social networking sites for social commerce. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 343 users of social networking sites in Pakistan. The data analysis was conducted using PLS-SEM. Findings: The results show that SCCs have empowered consumers through the existence of virtual groups, ratings and reviews and recommendations and referrals, thereby having a significant impact on social commerce intentions. The relationship quality with social networking sites, measured through commitment, satisfaction and trust, also proved to be a leading forecaster of social commerce intentions. The impact of social support could not positively influence the relationship quality with the social networking site. However, social support influences the social commerce intentions significantly. Research limitations/implications: Future research should enrich model with some moderating variables and data may be collected from actual online shoppers only. Practical implications: This study provides valuable insights to retailers to formulate their social commerce strategies as per decision factors results to have maximum engagement of consumers in social commerce.

"Purpose: Consumers increasingly depend on the internet as the information source to make their hospitality decisions, which highlights the need for more research in online recommendation. Due to the globalization, culture and its effects on marketing become an increasingly important subject to investigate. Therefore, this paper aims to offer a cross-cultural investigation of consumers’ different trustworthiness and credibility perceptions when facing online recommendations from different information resources. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the source-credibility theory to examine consumers’ responses to online recommendations from two sources. Participants were recruited from two equivalent marketing panels in each culture. A 2 (online recommendation source: in-group vs out-group) by 2 (culture: American vs Chinese) between-subjects quasi-experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results demonstrate that culture moderates consumer responses to the two types of online sources. Chinese consumers, due to their more collectivist nature, exhibit higher levels of purchase intent when the recommendation originates from an in-group rather than from an out-group. Such differences are not observed among the more individualist American consumers. Furthermore, trustworthiness plays an important role in influencing Chinese consumers’ perception of recommendation credibility and the consequent purchase intent. Practical implications: This research provides guidelines to hospitality practitioners when developing their social networking sites and online marketing strategies across different cultures.

"Interest in customer reacquisition has increased as firms embrace the concept of customer relationship management. Using survey and transactional data from defected subscribers of a publishing company, we investigate how defected customers evaluate their propensity to return to the company prior to any win-back offer. We introduce a new variable for relationship marketing, general willingness to return (GWR), and show that it is strongly and positively related to the actual return decision and the duration of the restarted relationship. Combining attribution theory elements with existing win-back explanations, which focus on economic, social, and emotional value perceptions, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the GWR to a former relationship. Importantly, we learn that regardless of whose fault it is, if the reasons for the relationship termination can change or are preventable and the firm can control those changes, then the defected customer has a higher general willingness to return to the former relationship. Also, we show that the duration of time absence before relationship revival moderates the impact of GWR on second relationship duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that satisfaction prior to defection and the length of time absence provide a reasonable basis for distinguishing defected customers who differ in their GWR. By applying our findings, we derive recommendations for firms on how to position marketing communications to recapture defected customers according to their general willingness to return. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",Pick D.; Thomas J.S.; Tillmanns S.; Krafft M.,Tactical,10.1007/s11747-015-0453-6,Consumer attributions; Customer relationship management; Relationship revival,5.0,,10,0,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of defected customers' propensity to return and the implications for marketing communications, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at executing strategies related to customer reacquisition and relationship marketing.",scopus-recommendation,15,70,Customer win-back: the role of attributions and perceptions in customers’ willingness to return,2016
"Agriculture is highly sensitive to variations in both weather and climate. Farmers face uncertainty in the weather patterns over the short term, and climate over the longer term. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) has promoted a system of Local Technical Agro-Climatic Committees (LTACs)4 in two Colombian regions to explore means of creating dialogue between researchers and farmers that would provide farmers with options in the face of both short- and longer-term variations in climate. The article uses a case study approach to describe how the original LTACs were established, the benefits obtained from the LTAC system, and the expansion of the system to areas outside Colombia. The basic premise behind the LTAC approach is: If farmers and the local rural community at large can access and understand weather and climate forecasts and the responses of their crop production, processing, and marketing options under local conditions, they can make better decisions on how to manage their farms and businesses. There are six basic components that are required to implement the LTAC approach to bridging the gap between climate science and farmers: (i) Establishment of the LTAC with alignment of local parties interested in managing variation in the climate and definition of their roles; (ii) local climate and monthly climate forecast; (iii) crop modeling and understanding of climate variation on crop production, processing and marketing and the impact this will have on management; (iv) dialogue between scientists, experts, and farmers; (v) dissemination and socialization of the dialogue; and (vi) local capacity building, which cuts across all the other five components. The regular monthly meetings of the LTACs are the focal point of the overall process, bringing together information from various sources, organizing the ideas and thoughts, and then disseminating the information. A feature of the committees was their diversity. The committees required specific inputs, particularly on climate and the crop response before each meeting. Research organizations provided climate forecasts and crop response data. The forecasts proved closer to reality than long term means and the crops models that were used to predict crop response to changes in management and climate variation were relatively simple and unsophisticated. The committees gained confidence in these prognoses, which then formed the basis for dialogue on how best to manage climate variation. The production-side participants appreciated the opportunity to present their own points of view and the move from top-down recommendations, coming from the researchers and extension agents, towards a menu of options which they discussed. At the same time, it was evident in the early meetings that many of the participants came ill-prepared to grasp concepts related to managing climatic variation, thus highlighting the need for capacity building within the LTACs themselves. LTACs actively promulgated their findings through bulletins, social networks, extension services, farmers’ organizations radio, TV, and the press. In the dry El Niño year of 2015, many farmers used the information generated by the LTACs to better manage their crops, increasing yields, and reducing losses. More LTACs are now being established in Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. These countries have understood the value of creating mechanisms through which researches and farmers can exchange ideas, with the farmers choosing options to improve their management based on better weather and climate forecasts and an understanding of how the weather and climate affects their crops. © 2018 The Authors",Loboguerrero A.M.; Boshell F.; León G.; Martinez-Baron D.; Giraldo D.; Recaman Mejía L.; Díaz E.; Cock J.,Not identified,10.1016/j.crm.2018.08.001,Agro-climatic information; CCAFS; Climate risk; Colombia; Local communities; Participatory approach,80.0,,5,5,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implementation of Local Technical Agro-Climatic Committees (LTACs) to facilitate dialogue between farmers and researchers about climate variations and their impacts on agriculture.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how headquarters’ managers perceive – cultural, administrative, geographic and economic (CAGE) – distance between countries and its influence on the strategy of international subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the transaction cost and behavioural theory and presents an exploratory and qualitative methodology approach through six semi-structured in-depth interviews to evaluate managers’ perceptions of distance between countries. Findings: The research findings show that cultural and economic distances indeed have a major influence on subsidiary strategy and a smaller impact of administrative and geographic dimensions, which results into forced changes on the marketing-mix, i.e. product, price, design and brand, as well as on the level of autonomy granted to foreign subsidiaries. Research limitations/implications: The limitation is related to the home country and the entry mode of foreign direct investment. The findings presented here reflect the nature and behaviour of Portuguese companies with subsidiaries. Practical implications: The research provides recommendations for managers to be aware of the influence of more than one dimension of distance between countries to improve their decision-making of standardisation-adaptation strategy for foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, the study stresses that managers’ perceptions may lead to the conclusion that proximity and knowledge of foreign markets does not make international business easier. Originality/value: This empirical research not only tests the transaction cost theory and behavioural theory on managers’ decisions to invest abroad but also promotes organisational changes to achieve the suitable strategy for international subsidiaries. The study contributes to the area of international business by positing six research propositions concerning distance between countries to be tested in future studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Antunes I.C.M.; Barandas H.G.; Martins F.V.,Strategic,10.1108/RIBS-01-2019-0007,Case study; Cultural administrative geographic economic distances; Foreign markets; Managers’ perceptions; Subsidiary strategy,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the influence of various distances (cultural, administrative, geographic, and economic) on the strategy of international subsidiaries, which pertains to long-term planning and decision-making for organizational goals.

"Objective: This study investigates the antecedents of three Brazilian franchisors’ internationalization processes in relation to their international marketing strategies. The literature review discusses the theme focusing on adaptation versus standardization of the marketing strategy. Method: A theoretical model is proposed for the empirical investigation including the internal and external internationalization antecedents, the international marketing strategy, and the firm´s degree of internationalization. A qualitative, exploratory, empirical investigation based on a multiple-case study was conducted with three large Brazilian franchisors in the fashion industry. Relevance: The study highlights the relevance of international branding for the internationalization process as well as the role partners/franchisees play in building and managing brand image abroad. Results: The results show that the most important antecedents in the franchisors’ internationalization process were at the firm level (company size, resources, and capabilities; brand strength; international orientation, and experience), with special emphasis on the brand as a crucial asset. The international marketing strategies were to both adapt the marketing elements to the needs and characteristics of the host market and centralize strategic decisions to maintain a consistent brand image. This posture follows the semi-global marketing strategy. Theoretical contribution: This study contributes to the knowledge about the factors that influence the decision to internationalize and the international marketing strategies used by Brazilian franchisors abroad. Managerial recommendations are presented for franchisors seeking internationalization. © 2020 Journal of Nanjing Agricultural University.

"This article describes how e-marketing is increasingly gaining interest within Islamic businesses. It is important to consider the extent to which it fits comfortably within principle notions of Islam and Sharia law. An Islamic business should ensure that its e-marketing strategy must be devoid of any contentious or exaggerated claims and there must be no excessive risk. As marketing practices include accentuating the benefits and features of products and services, and downplaying the negative attributes which potentially could lead to a consumer making an informed decision based on this unbalanced presentation. Arguably, this presents a form of risk that may be at odds with the fundamental tenets of Islam. This article presents a case-study of a large bank in Kuwait to identify how e-Marketing can be implemented more effectively to attract new customers and retain the existing ones by critically evaluating the viability of e-marketing strategies for promoting Islamic banking. A set of recommendations are also provided to support all Islamic Banks in the development of an e-marketing strategy.

"Purpose: – Word of mouth (WOM) plays an important role for the decision process of customers. This is especially interesting for service-dominant organizations like theaters where quality is more difficult to evaluate. In times of social media, third party recommendations can be given much more quickly, effectively and in greater detail. However, up to now not much has been researched on electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in a performing arts marketing context. The purpose of this paper is to provide some first exploratory insights into this research area. Design/methodology/approach: – To do so, a literature review is conducted to clarify the concept of eWOM and the relevance of recommendations in the performing arts. Then, parts of the results of an online survey on Facebook with 16 German theaters and their fans will be presented. Finally, the implications of the study results for theater marketing are considered and ideas for future research are discussed. Findings: – The study results confirm that recommendations have a high relevance for theatergoers and are very relevant in a social media context. They also show that the trustworthiness of eWOM on social media depends on the familiarity between the message sender and receiver. However, the results are limited with regard to the research design. Therefore, this paper concludes with ideas for further research. Originality/value: – All in all, though the study’s focus is narrow, this paper fills a research gap in the performing arts. In doing so, the understanding of the phenomenon and its importance for arts marketing will be enhanced. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Hausmann A.; Poellmann L.,Tactical,10.1108/AAM-08-2013-0013,Arts marketing; eWOM; Performing arts; Recommendations; Social media; Theaters,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the relevance of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in the context of theater marketing and presents findings from an online survey, which suggests it is focused on actionable insights that can be implemented in marketing strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,eWOM in the performing arts: exploratory insights for the marketing of theaters,2016
"This research considers how marketers can encourage or “nudge” consumers to transmit word of mouth (WOM), such as referrals or recommendations to friends, in a manner that helps reach, inform, or influence large numbers of consumers quickly, which is an outcome referred to as faster diffusion. Building on studies showing diffusion is faster when higher-connectivity people are involved; the authors propose a mechanism based on network externalities that encourages regular customers to select receivers who have higher levels of social connectivity. Three experiments and a simulation demonstrate the mechanism's efficacy by showing (i) how regular consumers can be encouraged to select higher-connectivity friends as WOM receivers, (ii) why this mechanism works, and (iii) how encouraging this receiver selection behavior can lead to faster diffusion at the macro level. The findings extend the WOM marketing literature by introducing an approach for encouraging transmissions to specific types of consumers that is a viable alternative to directly targeting higher-connectivity consumers in seeded WOM campaigns, which is often practically infeasible. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Stephen A.T.; Lehmann D.R.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.08.003,Diffusion; Field experiments; Incentives; Referrals; Social networks; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on how marketers can encourage consumers to engage in word-of-mouth marketing through specific strategies that target consumer behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-recommendation,15,65,"How word-of-mouth transmission encouragement affects consumers’ transmission decisions, receiver selection, and diffusion speed",2016
"Tourists' travel decisions can be influenced by appropriate policies that seek to encourage them to choose travel plans leading to more sustainable tourism practices. Based on using conventional cognitive decision-making models, most current policy recommendations employ market-based economic incentives (e.g. taxes). This paper employs a dual emotional-cognitive decision-making model to represent tourists' choices. This framework allows comparing the efficacy of taxing emission levels against non-market sustainability policies including: (1) environmental information labelling; (2) emotional communication messages, and (3) limiting time pressure marketing practices. A field experiment (N = 509) was used to test the effectiveness of both market- and non-market-based sustainability policies in reducing overall CO2 emission levels by affecting destination choice. It found that the sensitivity of the choice decision to price is overestimated if and when emotions are not considered in the choice context. Tourists' decisions can not only be guided by rational financial calculations but also by the interplay of their emotions or the “animal spirits” cited by John Maynard Keynes. Therefore, effective policies to change behaviour towards more sustainable practices in tourism can be induced by working through non-market interventions like shaping positive emotional messages (but avoiding negative ones) and limiting time pressure marketing techniques. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Araña J.E.; León C.J.,Strategic,10.1080/09669582.2015.1101128,behavioural change; CO<sup>2</sup> emissions; emotive marketing; Field experiments; sustainable tourism; tourist choice,5.0,,10,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of tourism policies aimed at promoting sustainable practices, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making processes.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Are tourists animal spirits?

"This study assessed the factors influencing marketing channel choice of dairy farmers in Thailand using primary data obtained from 385 randomly selected dairy farmers in central and north-eastern regions of Thailand. Two types of farmers were surveyed: members of dairy cooperatives (DCs) and members of private organisations (POs) representing the two key marketing channels. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, and a binary probit regression model was used to examine the factors influencing farmers' decision regarding the choice of marketing channels. The study revealed that dairy farming experience, the number of years of membership in the milk collecting centres (MCCs), distance to the MCCs, milk price, payment period, access to market information, advisory service, credit service and farm input service had positive influence whereas marketing experience had negative influence on the choice of selling to the DCs. The recommendations are presented.

"Research background: Endeavouring to develop healthy societies is a primary goal in many countries. As smoking is a major problem of public health, lowering the extent of smoking is one of the conditions for developing a healthy society. Based on the research revealing that the pairing of the product with negative stimuli enhances the possibility of negative reaction to the product as negative stimulus transfers it's meaning to the product, tobacco packaging was labelled with negative smoking-related pictures illustrating the danger of smoking. Nevertheless, the extent of smoking is still large in many countries. Hence, the effect of negative smoking-related pictures has been the subject of intense debate within the scientific community. Purpose of the article: The aim of this research is to determine the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. Methods: For the purpose of determining the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking, Implicit Association Test and questionnaire survey were provided. The questionnaire was elaborated based on the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. Findings & Value added: The theoretical analysis substantiated the influence of attitude toward the product on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, people do not always want to reveal their opinion, hence traditional marketing research methods for measuring explicit attitude are not sufficient as they are often not objective. Therefore, neuromarketing research methods complement traditional marketing research methods by providing more objectivity. Consequently, the Implicit Association Test and traditional questionnaire research are applied for the empirical research, revealing the effect of negative smokingrelated pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. The recommendations for the usage of negative smoking-related pictures on purpose to influence attitude toward smoking and consumer purchase behaviour are substantiated. © 2017 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

"Geographic proximity has become increasingly relevant due to the growing number of marketing services that use consumers' geographic locations, thus increasing the importance of gaining insights from this information. In five studies (both field and experimental), the authors analyze the effect of geographic proximity on social influence and demonstrate that not only social proximity but also perceived homophily can trigger social influence. They find that this effect holds under alternative representations of geographic distance and is confirmed for a range of different services and even for physical goods. Furthermore, the authors show that geographic proximity has a relative effect because the social influence of a closer sender is stronger than that of a more distant sender, regardless of the absolute distances. They present managerially relevant conditions under which the influence of geographic proximity not only is comparable to other types of information such as age or gender but also provides sufficient informational value for customers to offset differences among alternatives (e.g., due to higher prices) in trade-off decisions. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",Meyners J.; Barrot C.; Becker J.U.; Goldenberg J.,Tactical,10.1509/jm.16.0057,Geographic proximity; Homophily; Online reviews; Recommendations; Social influence,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the effect of geographic proximity on social influence in marketing, providing insights that can be directly applied to marketing strategies and campaigns, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,The role of mere closeness: How Geographic proximity affects social influence,2017
"A quasi-experiment is used to examine the dynamics of the shared decision-making process by observing couples in real time as they make decisions about an overnight stay at a luxury resort. Observations and video recordings of the decision processes of 24 couples were coded and analyzed. The time to final decision, number, and type of tactics used were found to vary with couples’ length of experience with one another. Observation indicated that couples with greater travel experience together relied on “predealing” based on their experience together to avoid conflict, while less-experienced couples’ decisions were more likely to yield winners and losers. These findings and those related to the use of persuasive tactics by members of the couple dyads provide the basis for specific recommendations for marketing travel products. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Smith W.W.; Pitts R.E.; Litvin S.W.; Agrawal D.,Tactical,10.1177/1938965517704374,couple’s negotiation; quasi-experiment; shared decision making; travel plan,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The study examines specific decision-making processes of couples and their tactics in a defined context, such as marketing travel products, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Exploring the Length and Complexity of Couples Travel Decision Making,2017
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence, price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Susanty A.; Bakhtiar A.; Jie F.; Muthi M.,Tactical,10.1108/BFJ-10-2016-0462,Dairy industry; Milk; Suppliers; Supply chain management; Trust,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the relationships between various factors such as collaborative communication, trust, and supplier loyalty, which are actionable for managers in dairy cooperatives.

Moreover, we uncover that consumers ethical efficacy (i.e., confidence in ethical decision making) affects their intention to share native ads through eWOM. However, consumer individual differences influence intention to share content online and trust in the native ads.
