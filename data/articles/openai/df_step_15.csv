"A key issue in engineering management is how technological forecasting impacts marketing and planning decisions [1]. Because published market forecasts influence both supplier and customer decision making, there is a need to understand the factors influencing these forecasts. Completing the management cycle requires analysis of the results and recommendations to change the original plan. In this case a postaudit of the forecasts was made to determine past performance. Recommendations were made to standardize the terminology so that future market forecasts could be better understood, analyzed, and postaudited. A comprehensive literature search of publicly available forecasts for the United States fiber optic communications market was made. The research indicated that two major trends within the fiber optic communications industry are expected to develop. The two major trends are continued growth and the shift of emphasis from long-haul to shorthaul systems. Growth will he driven hy cost effectiveness. © 1990 IEEE",Merino D.N.,Strategic,10.1109/17.45269,communications; consumption/ sales forecast; Fiber optics; market demand/ forecast; market survey; postaudit marketing forecasts; technoIogicaVbusiness factors; technological marketing/forecasting,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses technological forecasting and its implications for marketing and planning decisions, which aligns with long-term goals and strategic planning for an organization.

"This article presents the results of a study of the evaluation by more than 300 bank decision-makers of relationship marketing strategies used by their suppliers. The research identifies both explanatory and normative /actors of relationship marketing and its successful implementation. The main contingency factors are related to salesperson's knowledge of the customer, the existence of an atmosphere of trust and, the presence of a customer-oriented culture in the supplier company. Dimensions of relationships important for relationship marketing are relationship length, the customer's ability to adapt within the relationship, as well as the perceived fairness of the relationship, and this is reflected in findings where durability, adaptability, and equity explain supplier performance as measured by their client's satisfaction and recommendations.

"An important problem for organizations is managing information systems (IS) to support important business functions. The purpose of this research was to investigate and determine the extent, if any, that perspectives of IS planning and management advocated in the US literature could be found in practice in Chinese business organizations. Semi-structured interviews with general managers and IS directors in five Chinese business organizations were conducted to address this problem in the four areas of IS planning support, IS planning methodologies, data resource management, and the IS manager's role. The results reveal that Chinese 4business organizations do not automate administrative and business record keeping activities as their first step. Instead, they place highest priority on implementing systems that provide information to support management control decision making in meeting planned business performance objectives, such as achieving sales quotas or filling customer contracts on time. The results of this study show that the five Chinese businesses aligned their IS applications with a specific few business functions that were critical to successful achievement of their goals. The IS manager served as a manager of technical issues, which reinforced a technical database modelling approach to managing the data resources for IS applications. Implications and recommendations for incorporating IS into business activities are discussed and presented at the end of the paper for multinational business organizations interested in conducting business in China. An appendix briefly discusses the role that Chinese political, environmental and marketing factors play in affecting the management and use of IS in Chinese businesses. © 1991.",Franz C.R.; Wynne A.J.; Fu J.H.,Strategic,10.1016/0268-4012(91)90033-9,,5.0,,15,0,,"The research investigates the alignment of information systems with business functions and decision-making processes, indicating a focus on long-term planning and organizational goals in Chinese businesses.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Managing information systems to support functional business requirements in China,1991
"The report card concept does not connote a single instrument used for a single purpose, or for all instances of outcomes data reporting. Uniquely defined report cards can be useful to organizations and their stakeholders. Health care executives competing for marketshare in an era of negotiated prices and payor-controlled access to healthcare services must provide information about clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and organizational performance to those who are responsible for selecting health providers or health plans. The organization's leaders must view the reporting process as important from a strategic perspective, and establish processes and allocate resources to produce a report in an efficient and cost-effective manner that will meet the information needs of key stakeholders. Developing useful outcomes report cards will require collaboration among many individuals in an organization, and perhaps collaboration among organizations in a market area. Expected benefits to the organization include improvement in stakeholder relationships, which might be measured through increased market share. The proposed implementation model is based on a synthesis of processes and recommendations reported in the literature extended by information from an in-depth case study. Problematic issues with outcomes data and public reporting have been considered. Although the model is derived from a conceptual and research base, it is both pragmatic in design, and solution- centered. Research questions for future empirical research might include the following: Which stakeholders are appropriate recipients of what types of information? How do different stakeholders evaluate the relative importance of each type of information? Which reporting formats are more appropriate for which stakeholders? What effect does a truncated decision-making process (such as the one described here) have on the effectiveness of the decision- making process? How effective are report cards in marketing the institution's services (i.e., to what degree to stakeholders respond to the data)?.",Slovensky D.J.; Fottler M.D.; Houser H.W.,Out of scope,10.1097/00115514-199801000-00005,,0.0,,0,100,Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives,"The abstract discusses healthcare report cards and outcomes data reporting, which are not related to marketing but rather to healthcare management and organizational performance.

"Consumers of ethnic clothing from alternative trading organizations (ATOs) were compared with non-purchasers on their values and attitudes. Additionally, a more detailed analysis was undertaken to identify the evaluative criteria used by ethnic clothing consumers as they make decisions to buy from ATOs. Clothing Purchasers (n = 192), Other Product Purchasers (n = 100), and Non-Purchasers (n = 84) from the mailing list of Pueblo to People (PTP), an ATO that imports handcrafted products from Latin America, completed a self-administered mail questionnaire. Multiple discriminant analysis identified that the variable most differentiating the three groups was quality. Compared with Non-Purchasers and Other Purchasers, Clothing Purchasers described Pueblo to People's clothing as being higher quality. Additionally, Clothing Purchasers had stronger belief in the work performed by ATOs, were more concerned about Latin American people, had traveled more extensively in Latin America, and were more highly educated than Non-Purchasers and Other Purchasers. Recommendations were made on strategies that ATOs might use to increase sales.

"Four groups of marketing students (N=91) viewed color videotapes of four women interviewing for a middle management position, rated each applicant on five management characteristics, and made hiring recommendations for each applicant. The four applicants were videotaped in each offour costumes representing four levels of masculinity. Analysis of variance was used to estimate the effect of costume, person, gender of the respondent, and possible interactions on perception of management characteristics and on hiring decisions. The results showed that masculinity of clothing had a positive effect on (a) the perception of management characteristics, and (b) favorability of hiring decisions. Although gender differences were not statistically significant, females tended to rate the applicants as more forceful and self-reliant and were more likely to hire than were males. © 1988, Sage Publications.

"For products and services ranging from software to the latest motion picture, the use of new product preannouncements (NPPAs) has become commonplace. However, despite the key role that NPPAs play in the successful release of new products, almost no research has been conducted to explore the proper timing for such communications. This work provides a starting point for these investigations, by describing the elements of an NPPA and presenting a model of the factors that influence NPPA timing. Drawing on existing research and interviews with managers from firms in a wide range of industries, insights are offered into the nature and timing of NPPAs. Furthermore, recommendations are given for improving the effectiveness of NPPAs.",Lilly Bryan; Walters Rockney,Tactical,10.1016/S0737-6782(96)00092-6,,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Science Inc,"The abstract discusses the timing and effectiveness of new product preannouncements (NPPAs), which relates to structured decision-making processes involved in marketing strategies.

"The complexity of strategic market planning is well known to those working in this area. It requires many expert and intuitive judgements based on a number of interrelated, yet diverse, market factors. It would seem that expert systems and decision support systems might have a large impact in this area but the development of such systems has proven difficult with results, so far, less than originally conceived. This paper describes a hybrid expert system HYMS for strategic marketing planning. HYMS aims to provide a structured marketing planning process, guide a user through this process, offer expert advice at key stages and finally make recommendations for users in setting objectives and strategies. It combines the advantages of the expert system and decision support system technology in order to enhance its effectiveness. The paper first presents a brief review on expert systems and decision support systems in marketing. It also discusses the selection of a strategic marketing planning model for HYMS and a method by which structure and objectivity are introduced into the, largely subjective, process of assigning importance to various marketing factors. Finally, it describes the architecture of the prototype system and concludes with remarks from expert users in this field. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Burrell P.; Duan Y.; Boskovic A.,Strategic,10.1080/12460125.1995.10511662,Analytic hierarchy process; Decision support; Expert system; Marketing; Strategic management,10.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a hybrid expert system for strategic marketing planning, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making processes.

"Advertising budgeting theory suggests a number of important components of that decision-making process, many of which are examined in this article from the perspective of leading U.S. consumer advertisers. Sixty marketing, advertising and financial executives provide detailed information concerning the general characteristics of their company’s advertising budgeting models, the use of computers and software packages and suppliers, variables and data bases typically analyzed and the perceived performance of their budgeting procedures, among other factors. Although most executives indicate that computers are used in the advertising budgeting process, only about one third of them also analyze advertising-sales response functions. The majority of all executives believe that their company’s advertising budgeting procedures need “some” or “much” improvement and many offer recommendations. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Lancaster K.M.; Stem J.A.,Tactical,10.1080/00913367.1983.10672857,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the advertising budgeting process, focusing on how companies implement their budgeting models, analyze data, and improve their procedures, which are tactical aspects of marketing decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Computer-based advertising budgeting practices of leading U.S. consumer advertisers,1983
"Despite large increases in the number of new consumer product introductions, little attention has been paid to the integral role of the buyer intermediary. Although previous research by the authors has confirmed various hypotheses on the influence of relevant variables on channel intermediaries' decisions to accept a new product, it could not capture the range of options of a new product's decision environment. This article augments past research by analyzing buyers' accept/reject recommendations for a large number of hypothetical new products. Logistic regression analyses of these data confirmed certain past results: product decisions are found to vary as a function of buyer/product category, gross margin, and product uniqueness. New findings, however, suggest that overall vendor marketing strategy encompasses the most important set of individual attributes influencing buyers' decisions. Manufacturers would increase the probability of having new products accepted by selecting the optimal levels of the various marketing strategy variables. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"Existing literature provides little guidance to international managers for selling to public-and private-sector companies in emerging countries. This research attempts to fill this gap using the context of India. The study focuses on the criteria used by industrial buyers to evaluate suppliers. Four hypotheses related to the differences in the importance placed on economic criteria, familiarity with the supplier, reliability of the supplier, and other capabilities of the supplier by purchasing managers from public-and private-sector companies in India are proposed and tested. Purchasing managers from private-sector organizations place more importance on economic criteria and other capabilities of the supplier than do purchasing managers from public-sector organizations. However, there is no difference in the importance placed on the reliability of the supplier by public-and private-sector purchasing managers. Also, no differences in the perception of familiarity as a supplier evaluation dimension are found.

"Considerable controversy and debate surrounds the practice of slotting allowances, or fees, paid by manufacturers for obtaining the patronage of retailers. To date, regulators have yet to agree on public policy toward these practices; at least one federal antitrust agency suggests that slotting fees may be competitive, another has conducted investigations into these practices, and still another suggests banning them altogether. In this article, the authors examine the recent decision by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) to prohibit slotting allowances in the retail sale of alcohol beverages. Focusing on the regulatory environment, industry structure, marketing practices, and consumer consumption behavior in the alcohol beverage industry, the authors analyze the BATF's decision and attempt to reconcile disparate public policy treatment of these practices.

"Policymakers in many developing Asian countries have commonly relied on investment incentives as a major policy instrument to attract foreign investment. Using comparative case studies of Asian transnational corporations (TNCs) in Southeast Asia, this paper argues that investment incentives per se are ineffective in attracting foreign investment. The paper first examines the role of government incentives in the inflow of foreign investment, with particular reference to the Southeast Asian region. It then provides a comparative study of Hong Kong and Taiwanese investments. Hong Kong TNCs are shown to have invested in Southeast Asia because of market or market‐related reasons, not investment incentives per se. To these firms from Hong Kong, investment incentives are more a kind of post hoc rationalization of their decision making. For the Taiwanese investors in Malaysia, government incentives are less important than the existence of market access and the friendly host country environment. The paper also suggests some implications and specific policy recommendations for policymakers in host country governments. Instead of over‐reliance on investment incentives, host country governments should be more concerned with: 1) a commitment to internationalization through the promotion and marketing of international images; 2) the upgrading of domestic resources through continuous training and development; 3) a more efficient allocation of resources; 4) supra‐national coordination and promotion. © Routledge 1996.",Yeung H.W.,Strategic,10.1080/09512749608719201,,10.0,,10,5,,"The abstract discusses long-term policy implications for attracting foreign investment in developing Asian countries, emphasizing the need for a broader strategic approach beyond investment incentives.",scopus-recommendation,60,15,Attracting foreign investment?

"Focus groups are a common tool used in marketing research to determine customers' attitudes about products or services. With careful attention to the basic structure and using selected quantitative enhancements, focus groups can also be used by ergonomists for developing solutions to product and workplace problems. By involving users and supplementing their verbal reactions with 'hard data', focus group results can be understandable to marketeers, engineers, and management. Thus, the methodology gives practitioners an effective means for approaching ergonomic problems and gaining acceptance of their recommendations. This paper describes considerations for selecting participants, requirements of the moderator, and suggestions for designing the focus group session. They are basic focus group elements. Also described are three alternative methods for enhancing the basic procedure—combining it with prior performance testing, using it as a basis for a subsequent decision-making analysis, and incorporating a tradeoff analysis during the session.

"The Janus Commission was established by 1995-96 AACP President Mary-Anne Koda-Kimble to scan the health care environment and to identify, analyze, and predict those changes within the environment likely to profoundly influence pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical education, and research; and to alert the academy to both threats and opportunities that such environmental changes present. Throughout its deliberations, the Commission was drawn repeatedly to the pervasive influence of a changing, more intensively integrated and managed health care system on both pharmaceutical education and pharmacy practice. This fundamental change in health care has been the primary influence in the Commission's thinking and recommendations. The Commission believes that a revised model for pharmaceutical education is needed to meet the challenges presented by the changing health care system. In particular, schools and colleges of pharmacy must become true ""activists"" in health care policy, services delivery, and research in order to effectively achieve their missions in professional education. Employing the analogy of the pharmaceutical industry, the Commission suggests the following fundamental areas of emphasis for schools and colleges: • the need for enhanced research and development activities related to the provision of, compensation for, and outcomes of pharmaceutical care; • sustained curricular reform efforts that assure successful ""manufacturing"" of competent and caring pharmaceutical care providers; • aggressive ""marketing"" programs, working in collaboration with the profession of pharmacy, that promote the delivery of pharmaceutical care and foster enhanced practice/education partnerships; and • enhanced interaction with the ""product"" of professional education programs, the pharmacist, to assure that graduates can and will continue to provide effective clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes in the course of their professional careers. Finally drawing upon the previous works of the Pew Health Professions Commission and the AACP Commission to Implement Change in Pharmaceutical Education, the Janus Commission believes that fundamental actions must be taken immediately within the academy to assure the future success of our professional programs and graduates within the evolving health care system. Among these are: • completion of the evolution of the ""values system"" of pharmaceutical education toward producing graduates who are patient-centered providers of pharmaceutical care; • active involvement by administrators and faculty of colleges and schools of pharmacy in health care system decision-making, policy determinations, and research activities; and • creation by colleges and schools of action-oriented business plans that result in effective partnerships with practice organizations and health care delivery systems. The Commission encourages a thorough and critical reading of its report and looks forward to a very healthy, lively, and productive dialogue within the academy over the next several months.",Bootman J.L.; Hunter R.H.; Kerr R.A.; Lipton H.L.; Mauger J.W.; Roche V.F.,Strategic,,,5.0,,10,5,American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy,"The abstract discusses long-term goals and fundamental changes needed in pharmaceutical education and practice in response to the evolving healthcare environment, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Approaching the millennium: The report the AACP Janus Commission,1997
"Effective system design for service sector outlets requires the explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of its myriad elements. Facility design decisions as well as tactical, operational choices must recognize the marketing environment, including competitive and demographic factors, and their interactions. The particular design and operational features selected for a given retail service outlet will affect its sales, fixed and variable costs, service levels, efficiency, and profits. We consider a fast food chain contemplating acquiring, building, and operating a new outlet at a particular candidate site, with its own particular environment. We offer a normative approach for this type of decision, which arrives endogenously at the best choices for both design and operational features for the site. The final decision as to whether or not to actually acquire, build, and operate the outlet at the candidate site thus depends on several complex connected choices. Our implementable approach integrates the non-parametric allocative data envelopment analysis methodology with parametric regression analysis to yield a mathematical programming optimization model. We illustrate the approach with actual data from Hardee's, a fast food chain with over 3100 outlets, and an actual candidate site. The recommendations from the approach are compared with those from the conventional approach. A key advantage of our approach is its contrast to conventional approaches for site selection which ignore the more detailed design and operational choices. Additionally, the conventional approaches do not recognize the real possibility that labor and material costs might be affected by these choices. In conventional approaches, two types of errors can occur: (i) an incorrect ""go/no-go"" decision could be recommended for the site in question, and (ii) even if the optimal design choices are coincidentally identified, the forecasted level of annualized profits could be quite different, leading to an incorrect decision or priority about acquiring, building, and operating the candidate outlet. Other key advantages of our suggested approach are that: (i) various substitution possibilities (between more or less capital, labor, material, etc.) are considered, (ii) not only is the best configuration identified, but also a ranking of the possible configurations is available to help in sensitivity analyses and answering ""what-if"" questions, (iii) other specific sites (which serve as the basis for the recommendations) are identified, thereby enabling management (through site visits) to isolate the actual processes and procedures to be employed at the candidate site, and (iv) identify economies of scale possible. In summary, our approach identifies the chain's best practices in different environments, thereby enabling management to factor out poor performances due to flawed installation, lack of proper worker incentives, etc. Also, while the illustration is for a fast food outlet, the approach is equally appropriate for other service outlets, e.g., banks, hospitals, or pharmacies. © 1993.",Banker R.D.; Morey R.C.,Strategic,10.1016/0272-6963(93)90035-N,,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses long-term considerations for facility design decisions in the service sector, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various elements affecting sales, costs, service levels, and profits.

Basically, the test reports constitute an attempt to introduce more rationality into the drug area and thereby to improve the consumer's drug safety. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Glaeske G.,Out of scope,10.1007/BF00412141,,0.0,,0,100,Kluwer Academic Publishers,"The abstract discusses the evaluation and reporting of Over-The-Counter drugs, which is related to consumer health and safety rather than marketing strategies or applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Stiftung Warentest and the pharmaceutical market,1989
"Many knowledge discovery systems have been developed in diverse areas, but few systems address the use of knowledge in decision problems explicitly. This paper presents a decision support system for real-time telemarketing operations using the information extracted from the Bayesian network learning model. A prototype decision support system was developed for AT&T customer-contact employees to provide a recommendation regarding the promotion of a telephone discount plan. The system integrated a Bayesian network learning model (knowledge discovery process) and decision-making technique (influence diagram) to provide real-time decision support. A Bayesian network learning model was used to predict a probability of the customer's response from the previous promotion/response history. The influence diagram framework was used to integrate the predicted probability with the cost and benefit related to the possible actions. It was demonstrated that decision support by the Bayesian network learning model itself can be misleading. However, by linking the Bayesian network learning model with rigorous decision-making techniques such as influence diagrams, the decision support system developed in this paper was shown to provide an intelligent decision advice. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",Ahn J.-H.; Ezawa K.J.,Tactical,10.1016/S0167-9236(97)00009-2,Bayesian network learning; Decision support system; Influence diagrams; Service operations management; Telecommunication applications,5.0,,20,0,Elsevier,"The abstract describes a decision support system designed to aid in real-time telemarketing operations by providing recommendations based on a Bayesian network learning model and influence diagrams.

"During the past several years, there has been a myriad of recommendations for strategies to control internal parasites of beef cattle. The problem is not so much that many approaches exist but that management strategies for beef cattle vary dramatically throughout North America. The variations in climate, forages, classes of cattle raised, seasonally of breeding, calving, and marketing all contribute to management decisions made by the livestock producer and veterinarian. Thus, no one approach best serves the needs of all livestock producers. In this column, geography and climate, class of cattle raised, and general management schemes are used as the basis for developing guidelines for rational parasite control programs for cattle. The selection of anthelmintic varies based on a number of considerations. The primary species of parasite and the stage of development are the most important criteria. In older cows that have acquired immunity, the relative efficacy of a drug is not as important as it is in naive replacement heifers. The ease of administration, cost of the drugs, and additional benefits (such as ectoparasite control) may aid in determining the best choice of anthelmintic for a particular situation. Controlling Ostertagia ostertagi should be the focus of a beef cattle parasite control program. Other important gastrointestinal nematodes are Cooperia species and Haemonchus. These gastrointestinal nematodes plus the lungworm Dictyocaulus and liver flukes are the most economically important parasites of cattle in North America.",Craig T.M.,Out of scope,,,0.0,,0,100,,"The abstract discusses strategies for controlling internal parasites in beef cattle, which falls outside the realm of marketing-related AI applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,"Deworm in winter, spring, summer, or fall?

"As the need for marketing intelligence by sales and marketing managers grows more essential, field sales personnel are increasingly being asked to gather and report information. Many executives realize the potential value of using salespersons to supply information useful to management decision making. The sales force is familiar with their territories, their customers' needs and sources of information inside customer organizations, their competitors' marketing activities, and trends in product acceptance. The incremental costs and effort required are low compared to other research methods, since information can be submitted within the context of a regular call report system [2, 6, 8]. But salespersons have been found to be inadequate and uncooperative reporters in many instances. Numerous field salespersons believe that reporting infringes on their primary responsibility of selling, and furthermore that management apparently doesn't make use of the resulting information anyway. Thus, while salespersons have access to a wealth of marketing information of potentially great value to the firm, they are often inadequate, unreliable, and unmotivated reporters [4, 5].

"This article examines company practice and the advertising budgeting—sales forecasting timing relationship, assessing the key company and organizational variables involved. The data were obtained from a four-page questionnaire mailed to 900 senior marketing executives. Just under three-quarters of companies were found to set their budgets prior or simultaneous to their sales forecasts. The investigation of the remaining companies, those setting their advertising budgets after their forecasts, indicated that the key variables were company size, product category, functional involvement and management process. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that company size and the fragmentation of the budgeting and forecasting decisions may be the most important factors in why some companies set their budgets after the forecast. The main recommendations are that larger companies should strive to link or integrate budgeting—forecasting decisions and that further research should be undertaken to help improve company practices in this respect. © 1995, Advertising Association.

"The “go/no-go” decision for a candidate property, i.e., whether or not to actually acquire the site, choose the brand (flag), build and operate the hotel, requires the explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of the many myriad elements affecting the property's potential profits. The many facility design decisions (number and mix of rooms, capacity for F&B operations etc.) as well as other strategic choices (e.g., size of marketing program, level of service aimed for) must recognize the site's competitive features and interactions with the above. Also, the particular design and operational features for a given property will affect its different revenue streams, fixed and variable costs, efficiency and profits. The authors consider developers contemplating acquiring a given site, choosing a brand, building and operating a new hotel. They offer a normative approach for this type of decision which arrives endogenously at possibly attractive options for the brand, design and strategic choices for the site. The final decision as to which option to actually use, if any, should be based on subjecting the above identified scenarios, as well as others, to traditional feasibility analyses where judgment and expert opinion are applied. The authors' implementable approach integrates a “best practices” benchmarking methodology with regression analysis to yield a mathematical programming optimization model. A key advantage of this approach lies in its contrast to conventional approaches for site selection which often ignore the more detailed design and strategic choices. The approach deals explicitly with the complex interfaces between marketing and operations management as the endogenous site and competitive environmental factors interact with the endogenous brand and facility design choices. By identifying attractive options to be further explored (that might otherwise be overlooked), several types of errors are avoided: i) an incorrect “go/no go” decision could be recommended for the site in question; ii) even if the right decision to proceed is made, the forecasted level of annualized profits could be in error, leading to an incorrect priority for the activity; iii) the incorrect brand and facility design choices could be made for the site. Other key advantages of the suggested approach are that 1) various substitution possibilities (between more or less capital, labor, materials etc.) are considered; 2) not only is the best brand and configuration identified, but also a ranking of other brands is available if the “best” brand is not available; 3) the “best practices” at other specific sites (which serve as the basis for the recommendations) are identified, thereby enabling management (possibly through site visits) to isolate the actual cultures, processes and procedures to be transported and emulated at the candidate site. This paper illustrates the approach for two different sites. © 1997, ICHRIE.

"Most American firms are concerned with improving their quality. Unfortunately, the current literature does not give a comprehensive theoretical model in order to evaluate each recommendation economically. Because of the lack of a theoretical model and the complexity of quality improvement systems, integrative efforts coordinating marketing and production have been largely ineffective in the strategies of firms, since they have not been subject to traditional cost-benefit analysis. This study develops an integrative strategic quality management theory and a cost-benefit model which put quality improvement programmes into the traditional decision-making framework.

"Almost all of the problems that communities encounter when setting up drug sales schemes can be anticipated by giving careful attention to political, social, economic, managerial and financial factors.; Almost all of the problems that communities encounter when setting up drug sales schemes can be anticipated by giving careful attention to political, social, economic, managerial and financial factors. Problems are often attributable to the inability of governments to provide drugs and to the private sector's unwillingness to sell or distribute them where purchasing power is low. The 1st step is to define the problems of drug supply and their causes. Objectives then become clear. The community has to decide what type of payment it will institute. If prices are set above the people's ability to pay, the scheme will not succeed; if they are set too low, costs will not be fully recovered. Once the type of fee has been chosen, a number of other decisions have to be taken, including selecting drugs and estimating needs, obtaining start-up money, finding a reliable source of drugs, cost-efficient transportation, establishing a community drug depot, and establishing price-setting.

"As the global organic food market continues to grow, so too will the challenges associated with managing organic food supply chains. We consider an entry mode selection problem facing an organic farmer. Specifically, an incumbent conventional farmer is selling its product through an independent retailer on the market. An organic farmer aiming to enter the market faces the problem of selecting between the conventional farmer's retailer and an organic-only retailer. Consumers are heterogeneous in their purchasing valuation of the conventional agricultural product and its organic alternative. Horizontal competition between the two competing farmers is considered under different scenarios. Multiple-stage games are analyzed to study the impact of different cases on the pricing decision and profit of each player. The results show that when the organic agricultural product enters the market through the incumbent conventional retailer, two types of products are sold through a common retailer, the competition between the two farmers will be intensified, and the profit at the retail end will increase. It is always better for the organic farmer to sell an organic agricultural product through an independent organic-only retailer than to sell it through the incumbent conventional retailer. The paper makes two contributions. First, we derive the explicit equilibrium under chain-to-chain competition with piecewise linear demand functions.

"Problem definition: We explore the coordination of operational and financial decisions of proportional investment agricultural marketing cooperatives, where members' (farmers') equity is required to be in proportion to their patronage (i.e., produce supplied). Academic/practical relevance: In a cooperative (co-op), operational and financial decisions are inseparable because the co-op's investment capital is linked to its economic transactions with members. We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield.

"This study explored the rather rapid adoption of a new surgical device - the da Vinci robot - in the Netherlands despite the high costs and its controversial clinical benefits. We used the concept 'affordances' as a conceptual-analytic tool to refer to the perceived promises, symbolic meanings, and utility values of an innovation constructed in the wider social context of use. This concept helps us empirically understand robot adoption. Data from 28 in-depth interviews with diverse purposively-sampled stakeholders, and from medical literature, policy documents, Health Technology Assessment reports, congress websites and patients' weblogs/forums between April 2009 and February 2014 were systematically analysed from the perspective of affordances. We distinguished five interrelated affordances of the robot that accounted for shaping and fulfilling its rapid adoption: 'characteristics-related' affordances such as smart nomenclature and novelty, symbolising high-tech clinical excellence; 'research-related' affordances offering medical-technical scientific excellence; 'entrepreneurship-related' affordances for performing better-than-the-competition; 'policy-related' affordances indicating the robot's liberalised provision and its reduced financial risks; and 'communication-related' affordances of the robot in shaping patients' choices and the public's expectations by resonating promising discourses while pushing uncertainties into the background. These affordances make the take-up and use of the da Vinci robot sound perfectly rational and inevitable. This Dutch case study demonstrates the fruitfulness of the affordances approach to empirically capturing the contextual dynamics of technology adoption in health care: exploring in-depth actors' interaction with the technology while considering the interpretative spaces created in situations of use.

"Drawing on evidence from in-depth interviews and a household survey, the paper provides evidence on the farmers’ challenges in production, marketing and prices as well as how farmers perceive and deal with climate change impacts on coffee production in the Fero-two Peasant Association (PA) of the Wensho district of the Sidama region in southern Ethiopia. This includes prolonged dry season, erratic and insufficient rainfall, too early and too late rains and temperature rise. Unexpected heavy rains and snow events as well as weather change-driven pests and diseases negatively affect not only the volume of coffee production and quality but also the prices. The effects of climate change risks add pressure on the existing challenges such as land shortage and fragmentation, declining soil fertility and weeds. Lack of participation in decision-making and corruption are additional challenges for the coffee growers. Although the farmers rely on multiple production-related adaptation responses, most of the deployed strategies to the changing environment are less effective and short-term. The paper concluded that policy interventions should better comprehend the local vulnerability to build resilience and to undertake sustainable agricultural practices for improving the farmers’ adaptive capacity to deal with the effects of climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Abebe G.,Out of scope,10.1007/s10708-020-10210-7,Adaptation strategies; Climate change impacts; Coffee production challenges; Fero-two PA; Southern Ethiopia; Sustainable agricultural practices; Wensho district,,0.0,0,100,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"The abstract discusses challenges faced by coffee farmers in Ethiopia related to climate change and agricultural practices, which do not align with marketing-related decision-making or strategies.",scopus-robot,0,0,"Dealing with climate change and other stressors: small-scale coffee farmers in the Fero-two Peasant Association in the Wensho district, southern Ethiopia",2021
"The World Food and Agriculture Organization claims the percentage of the overall world population that will suffer from water scarcity and water stress by 2025 is estimated as 34% and 15%, respectively. Accordingly, it can be estimated that 40% of the 9.4 billion estimated world population will face water shortages by 2050. In this case, the ownership and efficient use of water stand out as common concerns for all communities in the world for today and for the future. In this research, the attitudes of consumers towards water saving were identified and factors that affect these attitudes were analysed within a sample from the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The survey was conducted through a face-to-face survey with 965 households in three Turkish provinces in 2009. SPSS statistical package was used for factor analysis to determine the affecting factors. Variables affecting water-saving decisions were reduced to seven factors via 0.792 KMO value. These seven factors explained 62.18% of the total variation in water-saving consciousness of the target group. Accordingly, it was understood that marketing policies should focus on water crisis awareness, environmental awareness, anxiety about water shortage, residential area characteristics, water pricing, the current awareness level and social willingness on reduction of water use to cope with possible problems. © IWA Publishing 2018.",Akpinar M.G.; Gul M.; Ceylan R.F.; Gulcan S.,Tactical,10.2166/washdev.2018.163,Consumer attitudes; Factor analysis; Turkey; Water saving; Water usage,0.0,,20,5,IWA Publishing,"The abstract discusses consumer attitudes towards water saving and identifies specific factors that influence these attitudes.

"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the adaptations and perspectives of hotel managers regarding green and smart hotel technologies within the context of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review guided the formulation of this study, followed by face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with hotel managers. A total of 17 prepared questions were finalized after examination by two expert academicians. The responses were analyzed using qualitative research methodology and the results were weighted using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Findings: Interviews with sustainability and operational managers yielded insights into environmentally friendly practices and strategies such as reducing energy and water consumption, waste and chemical reduction, supporting local entrepreneurs and adopting smart technologies. These factors are crucial in eco-friendly hotels. According to the SWARA analysis, 'reducing energy consumption' is the most effective criterion. Research limitations/implications: This study offers insights into green and smart hotel management by focusing on the perspectives of hotel managers with a small sample. In future studies, research with larger samples on customer perspectives and the effect of hotel selection is recommended. Practical implications: This study offers insights to hotel managers on energy conservation and customer satisfaction enhancement through green and technological applications. These technological applications can improve hotel service quality and provide personalized experiences, fostering customer loyalty. Originality/value: This pioneering study focuses on the intersection of green and smart practices in hospitality. By intertwining the often separately discussed concepts of “green” and “smart,” this study presents a novel approach to the sustainability practices in the hospitality industry, holding a key position, especially in Turkey. Implementing these concepts can yield environmental and economic benefits, offering invaluable insights to hotel managers and policymakers into integrating smart technologies with sustainability. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Akel G.; Noyan E.,Tactical,10.1108/JHTI-08-2023-0555,Green hotel; Multi-criteria decision-making methods; Qualitative research; Smart hotel; Sustainable marketing,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study provides insights into specific practices and strategies hotel managers can implement to enhance sustainability and operational efficiency, such as reducing energy consumption and adopting smart technologies.

"With the development of smart technology, mobile applications have become more universal and important in our daily life. Meanwhile, online privacy protection has attracted rich attention in both academia and practice. Mobile software functions require the authorization of user information. The misuse of private data poses a great threat to users’ privacy safety. It is a difficult task for developers to mitigate users′ concerns and sensitivity to various private data and improve their application performance based on access to the application permission. Based on the “ minimum authority principle,” this paper explores the impact of permission sensitivity and rationality on software performance. The sample data includes 33,772 records of 5,304 software applications in the Xiaomi app store from January 2018 to December 2019. Firstly, according to whether sensitive information of users is involved, permissions are divided into dangerous and normal groups. Based on the permission lists, “0-1” vectors of various permissions are generated. Secondly, four different permission factors are calculated by the spatial distance algorithm to quantify rationality and sensitivity. Finally, this paper empirically explores the impact of permission factors on application ranking based on the panel data fixed effect regression model, which takes application ranking as the decision result of privacy response behavior. Based on the privacy concern theory, this paper links permission invocation with application performance, proving the negative impact of improper permission mechanisms on application performance. The first section introduces the generation method for the four permission factors. The sensitivity indicator refers to whether the permission requires access to users’ private information or illegally shares or sends personal information to others. According to the classification system of the Android Developer Platform, we can quickly get the dummy variables for permission sensitivity. The reasonability indicator refers to whether the type and number of permissions requested by applications match their functional complexity and category average level. The average permission vector for every category is defined as an estimation of “ the least privilege” that best matches the application function. Then, we use the distance from the “ least privilege vector” to denote the irrationality degree. We can obtain four different permission factors by intersecting these two indicators. Mobile applications with too few normal permissions may have functional defects, while those with too many dangerous permissions may cause users′ privacy concerns. The rationality and sensitivity of permissions jointly affect users′ download decisions and application performance. The second part illustrates the influence mechanism of the four permission factors on application ranking. Dangerous and normal permissions have different impacts on mobile application rankings. Considering the particularity of ranking data, this study uses a rologit regression model combined with lag processing and fixed effect to eliminate the impact of other confounding variables. The results show that permission abuse will lower the ranking of applications in this category. The higher the abuse degree, the lower the ranking. With the same degree of rationality, highly sensitive permissions will increase users′ concerns about privacy and security risks. The impact of insufficient permission application cannot be generalized. Insufficient dangerous permission has a positive impact on ranking; however, insufficient normal permission has no significant impact on app ranking. In the third part, the additional model discusses the regulatory effect of apps’ functional descriptions on the influence mechanism. Software with rich functions usually needs to request more permissions. Users enjoy a high sense of self-anonymity in applications with simplified functions, which will reduce their privacy risk concerns. The consequences of security vulnerabilities will be more severe for complex software. Small changes in permissions may drastically affect the user′s privacy risk estimation and the app ranking. In this case, labelling dangerous permissions lower than the average level and normal permissions higher than the average level both have a significant impact on the application ranking. In general, application permission data is closely related to its market performance. While designing software, developers should fully consider the user′s privacy perception level and reduce the use of dangerous permission as much as possible. Without affecting the core functions of the application, a reasonable balance between normal permissions and dangerous permissions can effectively improve the application ranking and marketing performance. Analyzing the performance impact factors and permission evolution process is of great significance to improve app scores and word of mouth. © (2023), (Zhejiang University).

"Background: Built heritage in developed tourism destinations presents a resource of attractiveness, and its presentation through digital technology impacts the perception of culture. Objectives: The paper aims to determine opportunities for further development of digital promotion of cultural attractions by identifying the potential of websites, online marketing tools and smart technologies implemented by tourism attraction decision-makers. Methods/Approach: Qualitative and qualitative research methods were used as longitudinal research and structured interviews with decision-makers of the tourist destination. Results: Positive developments in implementing the digital promotion of cultural heritage during and after the pandemic are evident, but not fast enough considering the accelerated development of new smart technologies. At the same time, decision-makers recognise the importance of the digital promotion of cultural heritage. However, they are still unfamiliar with the possibilities of smart technology to affirm the digital promotion of cultural heritage.

"The understanding of destination image is a key point for tourism enterprises, local authorities, and policy makers. This study explores the case of Capraia, a small island located in Tuscany, to analyze how tourists (tourism demand) and local operators (tourism supply) create and communicate the island’s online image. This research quantitatively examines online communication on the two sides of the tourism market to monitor the online destination image of the island of Capraia. To build on previous research in this area, this study adopts a web content mining approach to assess the characteristics of content published online. The main dimensions of destination image (as developed in the literature) are used as a basis to create a dictionary for automated content analysis. A total of 24 tourism promotion websites and 9,180 tourist Instagram posts were analyzed. Findings reveal discrepancies between the image proposed by local operators and that perceived by tourists.

"Using text-mining, the authors develop version 1.0 of the Relevance to Marketing (R2M) Index, a dynamic index that measures the topical and timely relevance of academic marketing articles to marketing practice. The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures. Because the index is a work in progress, the authors discuss how to overcome current limitations and suggest correlating the index with citation counts, altmetrics, and readability measures. Marketing practitioners, authors, and journal editors can use the index to assess article relevance, and academic administrators can use it for promotion and tenure decisions (see www.R2Mindex.com).

Since the global outbreak of COVID-19 the virus has continued to mutate and its immune escape transmission and other capabilities have increased on January 30 2023 the WHO committee unanimously concluded that COVID-19 remains a dangerous infectious disease with the ability to cause significant damage to human health and health systems. Therefore wearing medical protective clothing as an effective form of personal protection plays an extremely important role in personal protection. However the research and development of medical protective clothing in China started late and there is not only the problem of mismatch between application scenarios and product functions but also most research and development are conducted from the perspective of professional medical personnel. In addition consumers apply medical protective clothing in a richer and more diverse scenario and the post-purchase evaluation of consumers can not only reflect their demand for medical protective clothing and influence other consumers' purchase decisions on medical protective clothing but also serve as an important basis for relevant enterprises to consider developing and improving their marketing strategies. To deeply understand current consumer' s view and demand for medical protective clothing this paper based on the collected content of 11 513 consumer reviews of 14 Chinese medical protective clothing brands carried out keyword frequency analysis sentiment analysis network analysis and co-occurrence network analysis accurately revealing the consumers' shopping experience perception and demand. The study shows that product quality and express efficiency are the most important factors influencing consumers' post-purchase evaluation followed by merchant services and application scenarios while affordable price only plays an important role in positive evaluation product quality and packaging are of great concern to consumers in the positive evaluation consumers are quite content with product quality workmanship material size comfort breathability product packaging and gifts express efficiency delivery and logistics speed price cheap price and merchant service customer service staff service attitude and service response speed . The consumers also express the need to buy medical protective clothing for timely and safe protection in daily life during the epidemic and in scenarios such as air travel. In the negative evaluation consumers' dissatisfaction is mainly focused on product quality express efficiency and merchant service such as poor product quality the clothing is too large to be worn the product and related gifts are broken when received and the product material is thin poor express efficiency slow delivery and logistics after the product is ordered and poor merchant service poor customer service attitude no timely response to information omission of products slow invoicing and difficulty to refund . This exploratory study provides new research ideas for consumer experience and valuable reference for the marketing management practices of medical protective clothing enterprises.

"An important use of the internet today is in providing a platform for consumers to disseminate information about products and services they buy, and share experiences about the merchants with whom they transact. Increasingly, online markets develop into social shopping channels, and facilitate the creation of online communities and social networks. Till date, businesses, government organisations and customers have not fully incorporated such information in their decision making and policy formulation processes, either because the potential value of the intellectual capital or appropriate techniques for measuring that value have not been identified. Increasingly, although, this publicly available digital content has concrete economic value that is often hidden beneath the surface. For example, online product reviews affect the buying behaviour of customers, as well as the volume of sales, positively or negatively. Similarly, user feedback on sites such as eBay and Amazon affect the reputation of online merchants and, in turn, their ability to sell their products and services. Our research on the EconoMining project studies the economic value of user-generated content in such online settings. In our research program, we combine established techniques from economics and marketing with text mining algorithms from computer science to measure the economic value of each text snippet.

"China's automotive industry has entered a stage of great growth. Owing to the widespread and rapid information dissemination of online automotive forums, they have become an important source for manufacturers to collect product defect information and understand consumer preferences. The purpose of this study is to investigate car defect information and consumer preferences from online automotive forums and segment consumers based on consumer preferences, which holds great promise as a means for companies to improve product design and consumer relationship management. Based on text data of China's top-ranked Pacific Auto Network, we applied the LDA model, sentiment analysis, text classification, and cluster analysis methods to determine the influencing factors of automobile consumers’ purchasing behavior, identified automobile product defects, and subdivided consumer groups. The results show that the factors affecting consumers’ car buying behavior are low fuel consumption, affordable price, superior performance, fashionable appearance, and comfortable use. Car product defects are mainly reflected in the three aspects of the car's performance, comfort, and configuration; there are six kinds of consumer groups: price seekers, fuel consumption seekers, performance seekers, comfort seekers, cost performance seekers, and appearance seekers. Of these, cost performance seekers make up the largest proportion, and they constitute the largest group of intention purchasers. These findings can help enterprises develop targeted product improvement programs, but also provide a decision-making basis for enterprises to achieve precision marketing. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Sun B.; Mao H.; Yin C.,Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12784,auto forum; consumer groups; online review; product defects; text mining,5.0,,20,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study focuses on segmenting consumers based on their preferences regarding automotive products, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets for product development and marketing.",scopus-text mining,15,60,How to identify product defects and segment consumer groups on an online auto forum,2022

"4.59 billion people worldwide use social networks. Over a billion new posts are uploaded every day to Facebook’s applications (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). Social networks play a central role in consumption and marketing, politics, and social aspects. They affect users' decision-making processes, emotions, and behavior. Content on social media can include, for example, movies, pictures, and texts. The emotion expressed in the post content has an influence on the exposed individuals. Emotions can cause the user exposed to the content to follow another user, view more content raised by a certain user, share a post, or express support (or lack of support), thus affecting the popularity of the user. In this work, we examined the relationship between emotions expressed by a character and popularity measures. As a case study, we analyzed the texts presented in the popular series “Friends” over ten seasons. We found that women in the series express more emotions in general and, in particular, more emotions of anticipation, joy, trust, and fear.

"Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Muñoz-Leiva F.; Rodríguez López M.E.; Liebana-Cabanillas F.; Moro S.,Strategic,10.1108/EJM-02-2019-0179,Bibliometric analysis; Co-word analysis; Point-of-sale marketing; Scopus; Web of Science,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study provides a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research, identifying relationships between various merchandising themes and trends, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and goal definition.",scopus-text mining,60,25,"Past, present, and future research on self-service merchandising: a co-word and text mining approach",2021
"Cause-related marketing (C-RM) has risen to become a popular strategy to increase business value through profit-motivated giving. Despite the growing number of articles published in the last decade, no comprehensive analysis of the most discussed constructs of cause-related marketing is available. This paper uses an advanced Text Mining methodology (a Bayesian contextual analysis algorithm known as Correlated Topic Model, CTM) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 246 articles published in 40 different journals between 1988 and 2013 on the subject of cause-related marketing. Text Mining also allows quantitative analyses to be performed on the literature. For instance, it is shown that the most prominent long-term topics discussed since 1988 on the subject are “brand-cause fit”, “law and Ethics”, and “corporate and social identification”, while the most actively discussed topic presently is “sectors raising social taboos and moral debates”. The paper has two goals: first, it introduces the technique of CTM to the Marketing area, illustrating how Text Mining may guide, simplify, and enhance review processes while providing objective building blocks (topics) to be used in a review; second, it applies CTM to the C-RM field, uncovering and summarizing the most discussed topics. Mining text, however, is not aimed at replacing all subjective decisions that must be taken as part of literature review methodologies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Guerreiro J.; Rita P.; Trigueiros D.,Strategic,10.1007/s10551-015-2622-4,Cause-related marketing; Text mining; Topic models,5.0,,10,0,Springer Netherlands,The abstract discusses a comprehensive analysis of cause-related marketing and introduces a new methodology (CTM) that can guide strategic decisions in marketing research.

"Although blood is essential in healthcare systems for medical and surgical use, it is still a scarce resource. Given that blood cannot be produced artificially, donors are the backbone of the system, which is why it is crucial for transfusion centers to understand the factors that determine their behavior. The goal of this study is to help decision-makers at transfusion understand what lines of research have been developed in the literature and which ones might be useful to define and assess actions related to the attributes of the donation system and donor behavior. To that end, this work aims to present an overview of the available literature on blood donor behavior from a social marketing perspective, which is of paramount importance in the context of blood donation. Based on the results of this review, which was performed by using the text mining methodology, this study presents current lines of investigation, and proposes additional future lines. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",Romero-Domínguez L.; Martín-Santana J.D.; Sánchez-Medina A.J.; Beerli-Palacio A.,Out of scope,10.1080/10495142.2019.1707741,blood donation; blood donor behavior; content analysis; Social marketing; text mining,0.0,,0,100,Routledge,"The abstract discusses blood donation and donor behavior in the healthcare system, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-text mining,0,0,Lines of Scientific Research in the Study of Blood Donor Behavior from a Social Marketing Perspective,2021
"The smart speaker market, which is considered an early-stage market, is expected to grow rapidly as smart speakers become a part of daily life. Consequently, manufacturers are trying to dominate the market. To achieve this, they must analyze users' reactions to their products and find insights for product improvement through comparison with competitors. We propose a four-step methodological framework for identifying meaningful opinions from a large number of online user reviews. First, network analysis is conducted to compare differences between brands. Next, through topic modeling, the attributes of speakers that users consider the most crucial are extracted for each brand. Third, sentiment analysis is conducted to examine how users' emotional polarities differ for each attribute. Through this, product improvement and product sales plans can be derived. Finally, in order to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each brand, brand positioning is conducted and user opinions that have changed along with the evolution of the speaker's generation are analyzed. Our study identified the factors that positively or negatively affect the experience of smart speaker users. In addition, the proposed method is highly useful because it can be used to derive insights from a large amount of user opinion data regardless of the search term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Park J.; Yang D.; Kim H.Y.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103186,Brand positioning; Decision support; Online review; Sales planning; Smart speaker; Text analysis,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses a methodological framework for analyzing user opinions and improving products based on user feedback, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into specific actions and targets for product development and marketing analytics.",scopus-text mining,10,70,Text mining-based four-step framework for smart speaker product improvement and sales planning,2023
"This study aimed to identify a new framework for consumer perceived value (CPV) and evaluate the dynamics of relative importance of different dimensions of CPV in the context of mobile marketing. Laddering interviews were conducted to capture the essence of CPVs, and then text-mining techniques were applied to extract key consumer values from the interviews. Six dimensions of CPV, namely, design, emotional, functional, monetary, guarantee, and social, were identified. The construct validity of these six dimensions was demonstrated through a rigorous sorting process. A best–worst scaling (BWS) survey was then implemented based on these six value dimensions to investigate consumers’ preference for each dimension in three critical decision-making phases of mobile marketing campaigns. Statistical analysis of the BWS data showed that significant dynamic differences exist among these six value dimensions in each phase. Gender difference and consumer heterogeneity were also presented.

"Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO) have received substantial conceptual and empirical attention in the marketing and management literature and both orientations have consistently been linked to stronger financial performance. Yet the way in which market-oriented firms seek to achieve superior rents is substantively different from that of entrepreneurially oriented firms which could lead to differential impacts of EO and MO on firm risk. In this study, the authors employ a text mining technique to assess firms' EO and MO and examine the impact of these two strategic orientations on shareholder risk outcomes. The results show that while EO increases idiosyncratic risk, MO decreases it. However, only EO decreases systematic risk. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that a firm's decisions regarding strategic orientation should be examined in light of both likely risks and returns in order to make appropriate resource allocation decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Bhattacharya A.; Misra S.; Sardashti H.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2019.01.004,Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm risk; Market orientation; Shareholder return; Text analysis,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the impact of entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation on financial performance and risk, which relates to long-term strategic planning and resource allocation decisions within organizations.",scopus-text mining,70,15,Strategic orientation and firm risk,2019

"A firm’s strategic emphasis on value creation versus appropriation, which is typically reflected in its resource allocation between R&D and advertising, is a central corporate decision that significantly influences financial performance. However, the drivers of such decisions remain underexplored. This study identifies a significant predictor of strategic emphasis, namely, corporate managerial hubris, and reveals some of its boundary conditions. Leveraging a unique dataset based on text mining of press releases issued by over 400 firms across 13 years, the authors demonstrate that high corporate managerial hubris predicts low strategic emphasis on advertising relative to R&D. However, this effect is mitigated significantly by firm maturity, corporate governance, and industry-level strategic emphasis. The results provide novel insights into the effects of hubris on firm spending, the situations wherein marketing decisions tend to be subject to managers’ psychological bias, the means of preventing over- or under-investment in marketing strategy, and the recruitment and training of managers. © The Author(s) 2017.",Kim M.; Xiong G.; Kim K.-H.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-017-0547-4,Advertising; Corporate managerial hubris; R&d; Strategic emphasis,10.0,,5,0,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses a firm's strategic emphasis on resource allocation between R&D and advertising, indicating long-term corporate decision-making that influences financial performance.

"The deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been accelerating in several fields over the past few years, with much focus placed on its potential in Business-to-Business (B2B) marketing. Early reports highlight promising benefits of AI in B2B marketing such as offering important insights into customer behaviors, identifying critical market insight, and streamlining operational inefficiencies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding con-cerning how organizations should structure their AI competencies for B2B marketing, and how these ultimately influence organizational performance. Drawing on AI competencies and B2B marketing literature, this study develops a conceptual research model that explores the effect that AI competencies have on B2B marketing capabilities, and in turn on organizational performance. The proposed research model is tested using 155 survey responses from European companies and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results highlight the mechanisms through which AI competencies influence B2B marketing capabilities, as well as how the later impact organizational performance.","Mikalef, P; Islam, N; Parida, V; Singh, H; Altwaijry, N",Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.113998,Artificial intelligence; B2B marketing; AI competencies; Core competencies theory,5.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the development of a conceptual research model that explores the impact of AI competencies on B2B marketing capabilities and organizational performance.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"Recent progress in data processing technology has made the accumulation and systematic organization of large volumes of data a routine activity. As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development. This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain. The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module. When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people.

"Over the last decade, many organizations worldwide have been assimilating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to increase their productivity and attain a competitive advantage. As with any technology, intelligence systems come with potential downsides. Despite the efforts to mitigate any negative consequences of AI, businesses and employees continue to confront the dilemmas of adopting AI, so it is essential to explore in detail the rising concerns around such technologies. In this paper, we used a single case study to investigate the dark aspects of AI in a Norwegian energy trading firm. We gathered data through semi-structured interviews and secondary data. Specifically, we interviewed AI managers, traders and developers who have worked on deploying and using AI tools over the last three years. Our aim is to identify the dark side of AI use in trading, how AI trading bots affect the relationship between traders and AI developers and how the firm adjusts to this new reality. The findings indicate that negative or unintended consequences of AI can be grouped into three clusters related to (1) the nature of the work; (2) conflicts and effects; and (3) responsibility.

"PurposeThis study aims to conceptualize the relationship of perceived artificial intelligence (AI) credibility with consumer-AI experiences. With the widespread deployment of AI in marketing and services, consumer-AI experiences are common and an emerging research area in marketing. Various factors affecting consumer-AI experiences have been studied, but one crucial factor - perceived AI credibility is relatively underexplored which the authors aim to envision and conceptualize.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a conceptual development approach to propose relationships among constructs, supported by 34 semi-structured consumer interviews.FindingsThis study defines AI credibility using source credibility theory (SCT). The conceptual framework of this study shows how perceived AI credibility positively affects four consumer-AI experiences: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social interaction.

Findings Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3).

"With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) transforming business-to-business (B2B) marketing, there is a growing demand to comprehensively understand the adoption and application of AI to advance B2B marketing. This study examines AI methods and their applications in B2B marketing across the four customer life cycle stages of reach, acquisition, conversion, and retention. The paper also analyzes and synthesizes the findings of five B2B industry surveys conducted to do the following: 1) examine B2B marketers' knowledge and attitudes toward using AI in their businesses, 2) determine the various ways in which AI is used in B2B marketing, and 3) investigate the perceived merits and challenges of using AI in B2B marketing. The findings reconcile various machine learning (ML) techniques suitable for use by B2B marketers. Employing the technology acceptance model (TAM), the paper identifies how B2B marketers perceive the benefits of AI adoption.

"Development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key approach to achieving economic growth in the Middle East and successful adoption of technology is vital for SMEs' success and continuity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is part of a new generation of technologies that can facilitate competitive advantage but currently there is a lack of evidence regarding AI applications in relation to B2B SMEs in Middle East countries. Therefore, this study empirically examines antecedents to, and consequences of, successful acceptance of AI practices by B2B SMEs in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model based on the technology-organisation-environment framework is developed which considers the impact of AI enablers and AI readiness on the acceptance of AI practices, and the impact of this on relational governance, performance, and SMEs' AI-based business customer interaction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling of survey data collected from B2B SMEs (n = 392). The results showed that, of the AI enablers, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by both technology roadmapping and attitude but not professional expertise. Of the AI readiness variables, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by infrastructure and awareness but not technicality. The acceptance of AI practices was found to significantly affect AI-enabled relational governance and performance, and SME's business customer AI-based interaction. This study provides a broader base for theoretical and practical understanding of issues related to AI practices in SMEs and the B2B sector in general.","Baabdullah, AM; Alalwan, AA; Slade, EL; Raman, R; Khatatneh, KF",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.09.003,AI; SMEs; B2B; AI enablers; AI readiness; Customer AI-based interaction,5.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The study focuses on the long-term implications of AI adoption in B2B SMEs, examining how AI practices affect relational governance and performance.

"Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a synthesized conceptual framework for artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in the field of business-to-business (B2B) marketing. Design/methodology/approach A conceptual development approach has been adopted, based on a content analysis of 59 papers in peer-reviewed academic journals, to identify drivers, barriers, practices and consequences of AI adoption in B2B marketing. Based on these analyses and findings, a conceptual model is developed. Findings This paper identifies the following two key drivers of AI adoption: the shortcomings of current marketing activities and the external pressure imposed by informatization. Seven outcomes are identified, namely, efficiency improvements, accuracy improvements, better decision-making, customer relationship improvements, sales increases, cost reductions and risk reductions. Based on information processing theory and organizational learning theory (OLT), an integrated conceptual framework is developed to explain the relationship between each construct of AI adoption in B2B marketing. Originality/value This study is the first conceptual paper that synthesizes drivers, barriers and outcomes of AI adoption in B2B marketing. The conceptual model derived from the combination of information processing theory and OLT provides a comprehensive framework for future work and opens avenues of research on this topic. This paper contributes to both AI literature and B2B literature.","Chen, LJ; Jiang, MQ; Jia, F; Liu, GQ",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-09-2020-0448,Artificial intelligence; Business-to-business marketing; Information processing theory; Organizational learning theory; Conceptual,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses a conceptual framework for AI adoption in B2B marketing, identifying drivers and outcomes that influence long-term organizational goals and strategies in marketing.

"Data-driven analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have become the most crucial aspects of today's industrial marketing management. Although many firms have embraced analytics and AI strategies, corresponding academic advances have been slow. This research investigates how industrial goods manufacturers sustain their competitive advantage in export markets, convincing buyers in a competitive data-rich business environment. The evidence has been taken from the RMG (readymade garment) industry, one of the largest manufacturing industries significantly attached to the export markets. Utilizing multi-phase research design, the study reveals that firms marketing analytics capability play a vital role in sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring the market, consequently leading to a sustained competitive advantage. The performance of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring becomes higher for a firm when they adopt AI on the strength of the marketing analytics platform. These findings exhibit the latest avenue of exploration within marketing analytics and AI's academic research paradigm.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13-15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade. This article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better go-to-development investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies. Despite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the early adopter stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues. High uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered. The article ends with a call to action, aimed at both practitioners and academics: AI is the most significant innovation in our lifetime! It's time we all got on board.","Cooper, RG",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.03.008,Artificial intelligence; New product development; AI in NPD; Product innovation,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of AI adoption in new product development, focusing on its transformative potential and the need for organizations to adapt to leverage AI effectively.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of customer service, we define as a technology-enabled system for evaluating real-time service scenarios using data collected from digital and/or physical sources in order to pro-vide personalised recommendations, alternatives, and solutions to customers' enquiries or problems, even very complex ones . We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers' service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition. Here we discuss our research and the results and conclude by offering practical suggestions for banks seeking to reach customers and engage with them more effectively by leveraging the distinctive features of AI customer service.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations are becoming increasingly prevalent, but consumers are often reluctant to trust them, in part due to the black-box nature of algorithm-facilitated recommendation agents. Despite the acknowledgment of the vital role of interpretability in consumer trust in AI recommendations, it remains unclear how to effectively increase interpretability perceptions and consequently enhance positive consumer responses. The current research addresses this issue by investigating the effects of the presence and type of post hoc explanations in boosting positive consumer responses to AI recommendations in different decision-making domains. Across four studies, the authors demonstrate that the presence of post hoc explanations increases interpretability perceptions, which in turn fosters positive consumer responses (e.g., trust, purchase intention, and click-through) to AI recommendations. Moreover, they show that the facilitating effect of post hoc explanations is stronger in the utilitarian (vs. hedonic) decision-making domain. Further, explanation type modulates the effectiveness of post hoc explanations such that attribute-based explanations are more effective in enhancing trust in the utilitarian decision-making domain, whereas user-based explanations are more effective in the hedonic decision-making domain.","Chen, CD; Tian, AD; Jiang, RC",Operational,10.1177/10949968231200221,AI recommendations; post hoc explanations; trust; consumer responses; interpretability perceptions; hedonic/utilitarian decision making,5.0,,60,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses how post hoc explanations in AI recommendations can enhance consumer trust and decision-making, which relates directly to the day-to-day operations of consumer interactions with AI systems.",wos-ai,10,25,When Post Hoc Explanation Knocks: Consumer Responses to Explainable AI Recommendations,2023
"Decision-making in marketing has changed dramatically in the past decade. Companies increasingly use algorithms to generate predictions for marketing decisions, such as which consumers to target with which offers. Such algorithmic decision-making promises to make marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective. Not surprisingly, machine learning is a trending topic for marketing researchers and practitioners. However, machine learning also introduces important challenges to the marketing landscape. We discuss this development by outlining recent progress and future research directions of machine learning in marketing. Specifically, we provide an overview of typical machine learning applications in marketing and present a guiding framework. We position the articles in the Journal of Business Research's Special Issue on Machine Learning in Marketing within this framework and conclude by putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area.","Herhausen, D; Bernritter, SF; Ngai, EWT; Kumar, A; Delen, D",Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.114254,Machine learning; Privacy; Algorithm; Marketing; Research agenda,5.0,,5,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of machine learning in marketing, including its potential to transform decision-making processes and the need for a research agenda to guide future studies.

"Over the past few decades research has predominantly focused on the technical aspects and theoretical challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the deluge of data and the increase in processing power, businesses are now facing the challenge of how to deploy AI that generates business value. In this direction, there is still nascent research on how AI can be leveraged in for B2B operations, and particularly marketing. To address this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm and specifically on the micro-foundations approach and builds on three selected case studies of large organizations in Norway that use AI for B2B marketing purposes. The study identifies a number of AI-specific micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities, essentially highlighting how organizations can use AI to manage B2B marketing operations in dynamic and uncertain environments.

"With every changing product and service landscape the customer needs and their expectations are also evolving. In terms of quick delivery and quick response to customer queries an organization is left with no choice but to adapt to the latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Artificial Intelligence is the capacity of machines to recognize, learn and make decision from its surrounding environment. This paper is an attempt to identify the ways how artificial intelligence is transforming marketing. It also aims to study the impact of awareness of AI on perception of use of AI with reference to different uses of AI during the customer journey. The select sample belongs to the area of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Correlation and regression results showed that impact of awareness of AI on perception of use of AI with reference to voice search was found to be having significant influence. However, it was found that there was no impact of awareness of AI on perception of other four uses in the study.

"PurposeThe recent pandemic disrupted the way in which businesses transact with each other. In response to maintaining cleanliness in business-to-business (B2B) settings, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robots have been adopted as substitutes for cleaning personnel, yet their implications remain largely underexamined. This study aims to examine B2B buyer responses to cleaning information notices (human vs AI-enabled agent) placed at either the entry to the premises or the sales counter, thereby adding to the nascent literature in this line of inquiry.Design/methodology/approachThree field experiments were conducted across diverse B2B businesses (wholesalers in Studies 1-2 and a commercial business in Study 3). To achieve greater empirical rigor and generalizability, this research used diverse stimuli across different B2B settings. In addition, the results ruled out alternate explanations and shed light upon political ideology as a boundary condition. Finally, a single-paper meta-analysis confirmed H1, consolidating the established effect.FindingsFeaturing over 1,000 B2B buyers, the results show that politically liberal B2B buyers express greater preference for human over AI-performed cleaning while labor-orientated buyers are indifferent. Importantly, this effect is driven by greater relaxation associated with humans, which in turn, increases their future patronage and referral intent.Originality/valueThe results enrich the collective knowledge of the adoption of AI-enabled robots, reinforcing for marketing practitioners and businesses that the reliance on human-based outcomes remains a preferred touchpoint in B2B settings, particularly for liberals.","van Esch, P",Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-03-2023-0126,Artificial intelligence (AI); Future patronage intent; Political ideology; Referral intent; Relaxation; State-based emotions,0.0,,15,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study examines B2B buyer responses to cleaning information notices, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing that interprets strategic goals into specific targets and actions.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands ready to impact all aspects of business, from optimizing operations to personalizing services and enhancing customer value. However, many organizations grapple with implementing AI solutions due to a lack of necessary infrastructure and mechanisms. In short, many companies are not adequately prepared to adopt AI. To make matters worse, the literature does not offer sufficient insights into this issue. To help address this issue, in this article, the authors explore what it means to become 'AI-ready.' Specifically, this study identifies the various dimensions of AI readiness through in-depth semi-structured interviews with top- and middle-level managers from 52 multinational corporations in Southeast Asia, primarily in India. This study employed a qualitative data analysis approach to construct a grounded theory model focusing on AI readiness. The methodology involved systematic examination and coding of data to identify key themes and patterns, enabling the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework. The findings suggest that AI readiness can be categorized into eight dimensions: informational, environmental, infrastructural, participants, process, customers, data, and technological readiness. This study makes a significant contribution to marketing, management, and information systems by conceptualizing the AI readiness construct and identifying its key dimensions.","Tehrani, AN; Ray, S; Roy, SK; Gruner, RL; Appio, FP",Strategic,10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102948,Artificial intelligence; AI readiness; Multinational corporations; AI adoption strategies; Work system framework,10.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER,"The abstract discusses the concept of 'AI readiness' and its dimensions, which pertains to long-term organizational goals and infrastructure necessary for adopting AI.

"TikTok is increasingly influential in promoting brand awareness and boosting purchase intention. From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers' purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5 -point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly popular concept, although it is often used only as a marketing tool to label activities that are very far from AI. The purpose of this article is to show what artificial intelligence (AI) tools - expert systems - can actually be used for administrative decision in public administration. The end of the administrative decision must be justified in detail according to the legal regulations. Expert systems do this. The other large group of AI tools, solutions based on machine learning, act as black boxes, mapping input data to output data, so the reason for the solution is unknown. Therefore, these tools are not suitable for direct, administrative decision, but can support office work with expert systems.

"Organizations have cultural-cognitive and regulative as well as normative elements that impact their employees. Organizations, by definition, cannot achieve a pure, stable state and always go through various change processes, both incremental and radical changes. Moving from legacy business-to-business (B2B) relationship management to an artificial intelligence-based customer relationship management (AI-CRM) is a gradual but paradigm change. AI-CRM leverages intelligent systems to automate the B2B relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention. Relationship management in the B2B segment is considered a strategic activity of an organization. Moving from legacy to AI-CRM to facilitate B2B relationship management activities is an important decision, and proper implementation of AI-CRM is a critical success parameter for an organization.
