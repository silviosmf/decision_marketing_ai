"Smart assisted living technologies are often touted as the solution to the challenges associated with an ageing population. Viewing elderly consumers, their relatives, and technologies as comprising an assemblage, this article aims to understand how smart objects actively reshape the everyday practices in families with elderly consumers. Interviews with and observations of users of smart alarm systems indicate a stratification of the paired experiences of users and systems and identify a tension between enabling experiences of the elderly and constraining experiences of the relatives. This article contributes to views of families with elderly as assemblages by providing insights into joint and disjoint consumer experiences in multiple consumer-object assemblages, identity negotiations of the elderly and their relatives, and the hidden costs of smart assisted living technologies.","Schneider-Kamp, A; Askegaard, S",Out of scope,10.1080/0267257X.2022.2078862,Elderly consumption ensemble; consumer-object assemblage; smart objects; Internet of Things; assisted living technology; assemblage theory,,0.0,5,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses smart assisted living technologies and their impact on elderly consumers and their relatives, which falls outside the realm of marketing and focuses more on healthcare and technology applications.",wos-Internet of Things,5,5,Reassembling the elderly consumption ensemble: retaining independence through smart assisted living technologies,2022
"This paper aims to discuss the adoption of information technology by retailers in Jordan and the impact on retail space, particularly in major urban areas of Jordan. Retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, and Metro are using advanced technologies to continue attracting and expanding consumers with the advent of internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID) and point of sales (POS) hardware and software and retail. The study relied on the explanatory approach to achieve these objectives. The study sample consisted of 134 stores that were chosen randomly and 480 customers of these stores, which were also chosen randomly. A questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and distributed among the respondents. The statistical analysis program (SPSS) was used to analyze the data obtained from the sample and test the hypotheses. The study results showed that information technologies influence customer perceptions. However, RFID appears to have no impact on employee perception. Retailers' attitudes and adoption of information technologies in the Jordanian retail sector are heavily influenced by external factors. RFID usage does not play a significant role in determining the retailers' attitude towards adopting IT practices. The reason for such an outcome may be that sometimes the devices fail to read the various codes, and thus, it makes it difficult for the retailer to scan the products.","Alomari, KM",Tactical,10.21511/im.18(1).2022.04,IT practices; retail sector; employee perspective; customer perspective,5.0,,15,0,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,"The study discusses the adoption of information technology by retailers and its impact on customer perceptions and retail practices, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into specific targets and actions.",wos-Internet of Things,10,70,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRACTICES IN THE JORDANIAN RETAIL SECTOR: EMPLOYEE AND CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE,2022
"Introduction. The study contributes to the theoretical knowledge by expanding understanding of auditory encoding of prices, further testing the working memory capacities, and understanding the psychological underpinnings of price perceptions. From a managerial perspective, our findings will help marketers to better understand the cognitive processes of price perception while voice-ordering through smart devices, thus improving company pricing decisions and increasing number of sales. Aim and tasks. In this study, we aim to understand the psychological underpinnings of price perception during auditory price information encoding. In particular, we research how the price pronunciation order of the item on sale (first the sale price and then the usual price or vice versa) affects the sale evaluation and subsequent purchase intention. Results. Prior to making predictions about price perception through auditory sense and its subsequent evaluation, we need to understand the cognitive processes underlying numbers encoding. Numerical cognition process follows five stages: (1) initial exposure to numerical information (i.e., numerical presentation in visual or verbal format), (2) numerical information encoding, (3) representation of the numerical information in memory, (4) retrieval of that information in order to perform some cognitive task (e.g. price evaluation), and (5) consumer response based on processed information. Thus, the internal consistency reliability of the questions has already been tested using Cronbach's alpha parameter and has been proved to be of the appropriate level. Lastly, in addition to these context-related questions, we include two attention checks questions and the question on the questionnaire purpose in order to control for random box-checking and exclude responses which guessed the study reasons from further analysis. Conclusions. From a theoretical standpoint, this study contributes to two literature streams: (1) marketing literature on pricing and (2) the psychological literature on numerical cognition. In the pricing area, the findings of the study further support and shed light on the application of the anchoring effect during purchase decisions. The study taps into the area of conscious and unconscious comparisons with price anchors and helps to reconcile previous researches who found different effects of price anchors on willingness to pay for the product or service. In addition, the study provides novel insights regarding pricing decisions in auditory rather than visual domain, laying a foundation for further exploration of this area.","Filipishina, L; Gonchar, V; Bohachov, O",Strategic,10.31520/2616-7107/2020.4.2-5,IT marketing; price perception; IOT; smart devices; anchoring,5.0,,10,0,Dr. Viktor Koval,"The study contributes to theoretical knowledge regarding price perception and auditory encoding, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and decision-making in marketing strategies.",wos-IoT,60,25,RESEARCH OF IT INFLUENCE ON THE PRICE PERCEPTION,2020

"Given the success of neural networks in a variety of applications in engineering, such as speech and image quantization, it is natural to consider its application to similar problems in other domains. A related problem that arises in business is market segmentation for which clustering techniques are used. In this paper, we explore the ability of a specific neural network, namely the Frequency-Sensitive Competitive Learning Algorithm (FSCL), to cluster data for developing strategic marketing decisions. To this end, we investigate the comparative performance of FSCL vis-a-vis the K-means clustering technique. A cluster analysis conducted on brand choice data for the coffee category revealed that the two methodologies resulted in widely differing cluster solutions. In an effort to address the dispute over the appropriate methodology, a comparative performance investigation was undertaken using simulated data with known cluster solutions in a fairly large experimental design to mimic varying data quality to reflect data collection and measurement error. Based on the results of these studies, it is observed that a combination of the two methodologies, wherein the results of the FSCL network are input as seeds to the K-means, seems to provide more managerially insightful segmentation schemes.","Balakrishnan, PV; Cooper, MC; Jacob, VS; Lewis, PA",Strategic,10.1016/0377-2217(96)00046-X,K-means; neural networks; segmentation; comparative performance; brand choice; data quality; marketing,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"The abstract discusses the application of a neural network (FSCL) to market segmentation, which is a high-level strategic decision-making process aimed at developing marketing strategies.

"The effects of the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis call for more active support for the tourism industry. To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism. This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy. The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies.","Polyakov, M; Bilozubenko, V; Nebaba, N; Korneyev, M; Saihak, Y",Strategic,10.21511/im.16(4).2020.10,tourism; country clustering; asymmetry factors; supranational policy; marketing strategy,5.0,,10,5,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of a tourism policy and the competitiveness of national tourism sectors within the EU.

"Hydrogen-powered vehicles or fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) are recognized as one of the leading innovations within sustainable technologies. However, to the best of our knowledge, only few studies have been conducted regarding the consumer's perspective of the product. This study focuses on analyzing the consumer's criteria and level behind their behavior regarding these vehicles to identify consumer segments that can be potential innovators and early adopters of FCEV. The K-means clustering method was employed to identify different consumer segments based on their chosen criteria. Next, consumer characteristics and their preferences were analyzed using a multinomial logit model to derive important marketing and policy implications. The result of the analysis indicates that 44.9% of the consumers consider FCEV as a potential alternative. These consumers consist of Innovative luxury consumer group (6.2%), Advanced eco-friendly consumer group (12.6%), and Economy-oriented eco-friendly consumer group (26.1%). Among the three groups, the innovative and luxurious consumer group, who considered all traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles with FCEV, had the highest potential to leapfrog to FCEV.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate segmentations by finance-related attitudes and behavior of financial consumers in Switzerland and Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach - The authors replicated the questionnaire measuring attitudes toward financial affairs as used in the study of Funfgeld and Wang (2009). In order to extract factors and identify profiles of financial customers, the authors applied the same techniques including factor analysis and a two-step cluster analysis (Ward and K-means) to both samples. Linear regressions were used to examine the impact of socio-demographic variables. Findings - Factor analysis reveals surprisingly similar underlying dimensions of financial attitudes and behavior for participants in both countries. The five clusters based on these dimensions exhibit strikingly similar characteristics. The authors also find that socio-demographic variables such as gender, age and education significantly vary across groups. Research limitations/implications - There are small differences in the composition of the revealed dimensions between the two countries, mainly a mixture of intuitive decisions and free-spending aspects. Future research may investigate more countries with comparable samples to further test the reliabilities and validities of the scales. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the instruments as developed by Funfgeld and Wang (2009) can be used not only in highly developedWestern markets but also in non-Western and emerging markets. Such instruments can be very useful for offering financial advice based on market segmentation in a global market. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence on universal segmentation variables that reflect financial consumers' psychological traits and attitudes toward saving and spending.

"Purpose - This paper explores various supervised ma-chine learning algorithms as an additional classification method to RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) mod-els with the aim of improving the accuracy in predicting target groups of customers for direct marketing response campaigns conducted by a casino. The purpose of this paper is twofold - first, to test how the addition of demo-graphic variables increases the accuracy of the basic RFM model and second, to assess if and how machine learning algorithms improve the initial model. Ultimately, we pro-pose a model for direct marketing response at individual level using RFM scores and customer demographic and behavioral data as endogenous variables to be used by the company. The findings can be used as an alternative to the simpler RFM model when approaching customer response modeling for large datasets and can be gener-alized to other industries. Design/Methodology/Approach - Our research em-ployed supervised machine learning methods tuned on historical responses to a casino's direct marketing activi-ties to improve the company's RFM segmentation model. Demographic variables were also included with the aim of improving the power of the models employed. Finally, we attempted to improve the best-performing model by hypertuning its algorithm parameters. Findings and Implications - The best and most intuitive model was found to be that using decision trees with Recency (from RFM) together with age and the awarded amount (from the demographic element) as indepen-dent variables. Surprisingly, the company's own RFM seg-mentation was also found to perform well.Limitations - Not all machine learning methods used for classification were included in our research nor did we use ensemble methods to improve the models' power. While all models developed are applicable to similar data, they could lose their accuracy when applied to data from a different industry. The company's own RFM model was not analyzed but was included in the model as is. Further insight could be gained by determining its optimal pa-rameters.Originality - This study contributes to the existing litera-ture by showing how direct marketing efficiency model-ing using standard RFM could be improved with the ad-dition of a company's customer property.

This study compares the forecasting performance of Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNNs) with classical econometric time series models for corn futures prices. The study considers various combinations of data pre-processing techniques, variable clusters, and forecast horizons. Our results indicate that LSTM-RNNs consistently outperform classical methods, particularly for longer forecast horizons. In particular, our findings demonstrate that LSTM-RNNs are capable of automatically handling structural breaks, resulting in more accurate forecasts when trained on datasets that include such shocks.

"Purpose There is a strong prerequisite for organizations to analyze customer review behavior to evaluate the competitive business environment. The purpose of this study is to analyze and predict customer reviews of halal restaurants using machine learning (ML) approaches. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected customer review data from the Yelp website. The authors filtered the reviews of only halal restaurants from the original data set. Following cleaning, the filtered review texts were classified as positive, neutral or negative sentiments, and those sentiments were scored using the AFINN and VADER sentiment algorithms. Also, the current study applies four machine learning methods to classify each review toward halal restaurants into its sentiment class. Findings The experiment showed that most of the customer reviews toward halal restaurants were positive. The authors also discovered that all of the methods (decision tree, linear support vector machine, logistic regression and random forest classifier) can correctly classify the review text into sentiment class, but logistic regression outperforms the others in terms of accuracy. Practical implications The results facilitate halal restaurateurs in identifying customer review behavior. Social implications Sentiment and emotions, according to appraisal theory, form the basis for all interactions, facilitating cognitive functions and supporting prospective customers in making sense of experiences.

"Predicting future customer behavior provides key information for efficiently directing resources at sales and marketing departments. Such information supports planning the inventory at the warehouse and point of sales, as well strategic decisions during manufacturing processes. In this paper, we develop advanced analytics tools that predict future customer behavior in the non-contractual setting. We establish a dynamic and data driven framework for predicting whether a customer is going to make purchase at the company within a certain time frame in the near future. For that purpose, we propose a new set of customer relevant features that derives from times and values of previous purchases. These customer features are updated every month, and state of the art machine learning algorithms are applied for purchase prediction. In our studies, the gradient tree boosting method turns out to be the best performing method. Using a data set containing more than 10000 customers and a total number of 200000 purchases we obtain an accuracy score of 89% and an AUC value of 0.95 for predicting next moth purchases on the test data set.

"We develop and test an active-machine-learning method to select questions adaptively when consumers use heuristic decision rules. The method tailors priors to each consumer based on a configurator. Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second and provide significantly and substantially more information per question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or orthogonal-design questions. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when there are response errors or bad priors. The basic algorithm focuses on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature levels). Adaptive questions outperform market-based questions when estimating heuristic decision rules. Heuristic decision rules predict validation decisions better than compensatory rules.","Dzyabura, D; Hauser, JR",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1110.0660,active learning; adaptive questions; belief propagation; conjunctive models; consideration sets; consumer heuristics; decision heuristics; disjunctions of conjunctions; lexicographic models; variational Bayes estimation,5.0,,60,0,INFORMS,"The abstract focuses on an active machine-learning method for adaptive questioning aimed at improving consumer decision-making processes, which relates to managing daily consumer interactions and preferences.",wos-machine learning,10,25,Active Machine Learning for Consideration Heuristics,2011
"In B2B markets, value-based pricing and selling has become an important alternative to discounting. This study outlines a modeling method that uses customer data (product offers made to each current or potential customer, features, discounts, and customer purchase decisions) to estimate a mixed logit choice model. The model is estimated via hierarchical Bayes and machine learning, delivering customer-level parameter estimates. Customer-level estimates are input into a nonlinear programming next-offer maximization problem to select optimal features and discount level for customer segments, where segments are based on loyalty and discount elasticity. The mixed logit model is integrated with economic theory (the random utility model), and it predicts both customer perceived value for and response to alternative future sales offers. The methodology can be implemented to support value-based pricing and selling efforts. Contributions to the literature include: (a) the use of customer-level parameter estimates from a mixed logit model, delivered via a hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure, to support value-based pricing decisions; (b) validation that mixed logit customer-level modeling can deliver strong predictive accuracy, not as high as random forest but comparing favorably; and (c) a nonlinear programming problem that uses customer-level mixed logit estimates to select optimal features and discounts.","Colias, JV; Park, S; Horn, E",Tactical,10.1057/s41270-021-00113-y,B2B; Sales data; Machine learning; Mixed logit; Nonlinear programming,5.0,,15,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,"The abstract discusses a modeling method for estimating customer-level parameters to support value-based pricing and selling efforts, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",wos-machine learning,20,60,"Optimizing B2B product offers with machine learning, mixed logit, and nonlinear programming",2021
"Uplift models support decision-making in marketing campaign planning. Estimating the causal effect of a marketing treatment, an uplift model facilitates targeting marketing actions to responsive customers and efficient allocation of marketing budget. Research into uplift models focuses on conversion models to maximize incremental sales. The paper introduces uplift models for maximizing incremental revenues. If customers differ in their spending behavior, revenue maximization is a more plausible business objective compared to maximizing conversions. The proposed methodology entails a transformation of the prediction target, customer-level revenues, that facilitates implementing a causal uplift model using standard machine learning algorithms. The distribution of campaign revenues is typically zero-inflated because of many non-buyers. Remedies to this modeling challenge are incorporated in the proposed revenue uplift strategies in the form of two-stage models. Empirical experiments using real-world e-commerce data confirm the merits of the proposed revenue uplift strategy over relevant alternatives, including uplift models for conversion and recently developed causal machine learning algorithms. To quantify the degree to which improved targeting decisions raise return on marketing, the paper develops a decomposition of campaign profit. Applying the decomposition to a digital coupon targeting campaign, the paper provides evidence that revenue uplift modeling, as well as causal machine learning, can improve campaign profit substantially.

"Budgeting and planning processes require medium-term sales forecasts with marketing scenarios. The complexity in modern retailing necessitates consistent, automatic forecasting and insight generation. Remedies to the high dimensionality problem have drawbacks; black box machine learning methods require voluminous data and lack insights, while regularization may bias causal estimates in interpretable models. The proposed FAIR (Fully Automatic Interpretable Retail forecasting) method supports the retail planning process with multi-step-ahead category-store level forecasts, scenario evaluations, and insights. It considers category-store specific seasonality, focaland cross-category marketing, and adaptive base sales while dealing with regularization-induced confounding. We show, with three chains from the IRI dataset involving 30 categories, that regularization-induced confounding decreases forecast accuracy. By including focal- and cross-category marketing, as well as random disturbances, forecast accuracy is increased. FAIR is more accurate than the black box machine learning method Boosted Trees and other benchmarks while also providing insights that are in line with the marketing literature.

"Today's Internet marketing ecosystems are very complex, with many competing players, transactions concluded within milliseconds, and hundreds of different parameters to be analyzed in the decision-making process. In addition, both sellers and buyers operate under uncertainty, without full information about auction results, purchasing preferences, and strategies of their competitors or suppliers. As a result, most market participants strive to optimize their trading strategies using advanced machine learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a new approach to determining reserve-price strategies for publishers, focusing not only on the profits from individual ad impressions, but also on maximum coverage of advertising space. This strategy combines the heuristics developed by experienced RTB consultants with machine learning forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet.

As such, its results may form a basis for a competitive advantage for publishers on very demanding online advertising markets.","Wodecki, A",Tactical,10.2478/fman-2020-0013,online marketing; real-time bidding; reserve price optimization; machine learning; forecasting,5.0,,10,0,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses optimizing trading strategies using machine learning algorithms to determine reserve-price strategies for publishers, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets.",wos-machine learning,15,70,THE RESERVE PRICE OPTIMIZATION FOR PUBLISHERS ON REAL-TIME BIDDING ON-LINE MARKETPLACES WITH TIME-SERIES FORECASTING,2020
"The authors test methods, based on cognitively simple decision rules, that predict which products consumers select for their consideration sets. Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

"Unlike brick-and-mortar stores where consumers can use all of their senses to examine a product, online retailers must properly present products to shoppers via a computer-mediated interface. In this exploratory study, we investigate how the brain makes purchase decisions when it encounters different types of visual presentation strategies. Specifically, we use event-related fMRI to study brain activation preceding purchase decisions under three visual presentation strategies: (1) static picture, (2) image zooming, and (3) rotation video. Twenty-four (24) participants made 60 apparel purchase decisions. Utilizing machine learning, we study whether and how various neural circuits are engaged in purchase decision-making in regard to different types of visual sensory information. The functional neuroimaging results suggest high accuracy (highest: 95%, Rotation condition) in predicting purchase decisions using brain activity in the product evaluation process. Furthermore, cross-category validation reveals the activation patterns under the Rotation condition most successfully predict choices across the other two presentation conditions: this suggests a potential universal brain activity pattern in these apparel purchase decisions. Finally, we found some brain regions (such as the cerebellum) that are less likely to be associated with purchase decisions but are considered influential in predicting online apparel purchase decisions in the context of watching a rotation product video. The cerebellar activation may suggest association with spatial cognition and virtual navigation in addition to motor control. This study contributes to the research field of NeuroIS and online shopper study. The results provide empirical evidence to support the refined S-O-R theoretical model Jacoby (2002) and heuristic information process and inform the practical implications of sensory-engaging presentations in helping consumers to make online purchase decisions.

"Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection, effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis, and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10-20 (13-24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients' demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%-96% or $1.6 million to $2 million.

"Considerable attention has been given to the notion of a set of human-like characteristics associated with brands, referred to as brand personality. The authors combine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. The authors show that brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers' minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity.

"Regular prices and temporary discounts are important elements for retailers' and brands' pricing decisions. These two variables need to be considered separately because consumer sensitivities to their changes typically differ. Although the scope and richness of retail datasets have grown rapidly in recent years, most of them only record actual prices paid by customers and lack direct information about regular prices and discounts. A systematic review involving close to five hundred publications that investigated pricing variables using retail scanner data confirms this, as 63% of them only observed actual prices. To solve this missing data problem, these studies often adopted heuristics to decompose actual prices into regular prices and discount depths. However, there are many such heuristics and their accuracies have not been assessed. This research introduces DEPART, a new machine learning approach based on regression trees with a publicly available R package and benchmarks it against previously used heuristics in two different datasets. The results show that on average the proposed method outperforms previously used heuristics by 26.5% or more.

"We propose a generalized revealed preference approach to infer how a firm adapts to a changing environment and provide a step-by-step guide to explain how to implement it in general. To illustrate this new approach, we apply it to Prosper, which is a peer-to-peer lending platform. We develop a structural model, in which Prosper uses an adaptive learning algorithm to continuously update its predictive models about borrowers' and lenders' behavior as more data become available and uses these updated models to help assign loan ratings over time. To infer which adaptive learning algorithm Prosper may adopt, we consider a set of algorithms motivated by the machine learning literature. For each algorithm, we use observed Prosper loan-rating decisions to estimate the structural parameters of Prosper's objective function. By comparing the goodness-of-fit of these algorithm-specific models, we find that Prosper most likely uses an ensemble algorithm, which selects past observations based on their economic conditions. We conduct counterfactual experiments to shed light on: (i) How does an exclusive focus on either accurately reporting loan risk or expected current revenue influence Prosper's decision making?

"Consumers' preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a predictive model for box office performance based on the textual information in movie scripts in the green-lighting process of movie production. Design/methodology/approach The authors use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to determine the hidden textual structure in movie scripts by extracting topic probabilities as predictors for classification. The extracted topic probabilities are used as inputs for the predictive model for the box office performance. For the predictive model, the authors utilize a variety of classification algorithms such as logistic classification, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector machines and artificial neural networks, and compare their relative performances in predicting movies' market performance. Findings This approach for extracting textual information from movie scripts produces a valuable typology for movies. Moreover, our modeling approach has significant power to predict movie scripts' profitability. It provides a superior prediction performance compared to previous benchmarks, such as that of Eliashberg et al. (2007). Research limitations/implications This work contributes to literature on predicting the box office performance in the green-lighting process and literature regarding suggesting models for the idea screening stage in the new product development process. Besides, this is one of the few studies that use movie script data to predict movies' financial performance by proposing an approach to integrate text mining models and machine learning algorithms with movie experts' intuition. Practical implications First, the authors' approach can significantly reduce the financial risk associated with movie production decisions before the pre-production stage. Second, this paper proposes an approach that is applicable at a very early stage of new product development, such as the idea screening stage. The authors also introduce an online-based movie scenario database system that can help movie studios make more systematic and profitable decisions in the green-lighting process.

"Logos serve a fundamental role as the visual figureheads of brands. Yet, because of the difficulty of using unstructured image data, prior research on logo design has largely been limited to nonquantitative studies. In this work, we explore the interplay between logo design and brand identity creation from a data-driven perspective. We develop both a novel logo feature extraction algorithm that uses modern image processing tools to decompose pixel-level image data into meaningful features and a multiview representation learning framework that links these visual features to textual descriptions, consumer ratings of brand personality, and other high-level tags describing firms. We apply this framework to a unique data set of brands to understand which brands use which logo features and how consumers evaluate these brands' personalities. Moreover, we show that manipulating the model's learned representations through what we term brand arithmetic yields new brand identities and can help with ideation. Finally, through an application to fast-food branding, we show how our model can be used as a decision support tool for suggesting typical logo features for a brand and for predicting consumers' reactions to new brands or rebranding efforts.","Dew, R; Ansari, A; Toubia, O",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2021.1326,logos; branding; machine learning; multiview learning; representation learning; image processing; Bayesian estimation,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the development of a data-driven framework for logo design that influences brand identity and consumer perception, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",wos-machine learning,60,20,Letting Logos Speak: Leveraging Multiview Representation Learning for Data-Driven Branding and Logo Design,2022
"In this paper, we propose a unified dynamic framework for adaptive ad sequencing that optimizes user engagement with ads. Our framework comprises three components: (1) a Markov decision process that incorporates intertemporal tradeoffs in ad interventions, (2) an empirical framework that combines machine learning methods with insights from causal inference to achieve personalization, counterfactual validity, and scalability, and (3) a robust policy evaluation method. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that the dynamic policy generated by our framework improves the current practice in the industry by 5.76%. This improvement almost entirely comes from the increased average ad response to each impression instead of the increased usage by each user. We further document a U-shaped pattern in improvements across the length of the user's history, with high values when the user is new or when enough data are available for the user. Next, we show that ad diversity is higher under our policy and explore the reason behind it.

We use robust and integer optimization in an adaptive and dynamic way to determine preferences from data that are consistent with human behavior. We use integer optimization to address human inconsistency, robust optimization and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to address loss aversion, and adaptive conjoint analysis and linear optimization to frame the questions to learn preferences. The paper makes the following methodological contributions: to the robust optimization literature by proposing a method to derive undertainty sets from adaptive questionnaires, to the marketing literature by using the analytic center of discrete sets (as opposed to polyhedra) to capture errors and inconsistencies, and to the risk modeling literature by using efficient methods from computer science for sampling to optimize CVaR. We have implemented an online goftware that uses the proposed approach and report empirical evidence of its strength.","Bertsimas, D; O'Hair, A",Operational,10.1287/opre.2013.1209,,10.0,,60,0,INFORMS,"The abstract focuses on developing methodologies for learning preferences and making decisions based on human behavior, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer preferences, recommendations, and choice modeling.",wos-machine learning,10,20,Learning Preferences Under Noise and Loss Aversion: An Optimization Approach,2013
"In the first decade of consumer neuroscience, strong progress has been made in understanding how neuroscience can inform consumer decision making. Here, we sketch the development of this discipline and compare it to that of the adjacent field of neuroeconomics. We describe three new frontiers for ongoing progress at both theoretical and applied levels. First, the field will broaden its boundaries to include genetics and molecular neuroscience, each of which will provide important new insights into individual differences in decision making. Second, recent advances in computational methods will improve the accuracy and out-of-sample generalizability of predicting decisions from brain activity. Third, sophisticated meta-analyses will help consumer neuroscientists to synthesize the growing body of knowledge, providing evidence for consistency and specificity of brain activations and their reliability as measurements of consumer behavior.","Smidts, A; Hsu, M; Sanfey, AG; Boksem, MAS; Ebstein, RB; Huettel, SA; Kable, JW; Karmarkar, UR; Kitayama, S; Knutson, B; Liberzon, I; Lohrenz, T; Stallen, M; Yoon, C",Strategic,10.1007/s11002-014-9306-1,Consumer neuroscience; Neuroeconomics; Social neuroscience; Genes; Machine learning; Meta-analysis,10.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the development of consumer neuroscience as a discipline and outlines new frontiers for future research and applications, indicating a focus on long-term goals and advancements in understanding consumer behavior.",wos-machine learning,60,20,Advancing consumer neuroscience,2014
"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known learn-and-earn trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser's MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel.","Schwartz, EM; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.1023,multi-armed bandit; online advertising; field experiments; A/B testing; adaptive experiments; sequential decision making; explore-exploit; earning-and-learning; reinforcement learning; hierarchical models; machine learning,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the optimization of ad impressions and customer acquisition strategies, which are aligned with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Pricing managers at online retailers face a unique challenge. They must decide on real-time prices for a large number of products with incomplete demand information. The manager runs price experiments to learn about each product's demand curve and the profitmaximizing price. In practice, balanced field price experiments can create high opportunity costs, because a large number of customers are presented with suboptimal prices. In this paper, we propose an alternative dynamic price experimentation policy. The proposed approach extends multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms from statistical machine learning to include microeconomic choice theory. Our automated pricing policy solves this MAB problem using a scalable distribution-free algorithm. We prove analytically that our method is asymptotically optimal for any weakly downward sloping demand curve. In a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared with balanced field experiments and standard methods in dynamic pricing from computer science. In a calibrated simulation based on an existing pricing field experiment, we find that our algorithm can increase profits by 43% during the month of testing and 4% annually.","Misra, K; Schwartz, EM; Abernethy, J",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2018.1129,dynamic pricing; e-commerce; online experiments; machine learning; multiarmed bandits; partial identification; minimax regret; nonparametric econometrics; A/B testing; field experiments,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes a dynamic pricing experimentation policy that utilizes algorithms to optimize pricing decisions based on real-time data and demand information.

"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to explore the concept of distrust of traditional banking institutions as a factor that can explain the choice to remain unbanked in a marketplace that is designed to be financially inclusive.Design/methodology/approachEarning, spending, saving and borrowing data collected between May 2021 and February 2022 from 17,819 consumers living in the United States were used to examine the factors associated with distrust of banks. Using a conceptual framework borrowed from the health services profession, the study was conducted in two stages. At the first stage, distrust among the unbanked and banked was estimated using a Boruta-random forest algorithm. At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis.FindingsResults from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked.Research limitations/implicationsThis study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field.Originality/valueThe paper provides a discussion about ways domains of trust and specific variables can be utilized to address the persistent problem of financial exclusion in the United States.

"Despite the growth of online retail, the majority of products are still sold offline, and the touch-and-feel aspect of physically examining a product before purchase remains important to many consumers. In this paper, we demonstrate that large discrepancies can exist between how consumers evaluate products when examining them live versus based on online descriptions, even for a relatively familiar product (messenger bags) and for utilitarian features. Therefore, the use of online evaluations in market research may result in inaccurate predictions and potentially suboptimal decisions by the firm. Because eliciting preferences by conducting large-scale offline market research is costly, we propose fusing data from a large online study with data from a smaller set of participants who complete both an online and an offline study. We demonstrate our approach using conjoint studies on two sets of participants. The group who completed both online and offline studies allows us to calibrate the relationship between online and offline partworths. To obtain reliable parameter estimates, we propose two statistical methods: a hierarchical Bayesian approach and a k-nearest-neighbors approach. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better out-of-sample predictive performance on individual choices (up to 25% improvement), as well as aggregate market shares (up to 33% improvement).","Dzyabura, D; Jagabathula, S; Muller, E",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2018.1124,conjoint analysis; omnichannel; machine learning; Bayesian; consumer choice,5.0,,25,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses methods for improving market research predictions using a combination of online and offline data, which aligns with structured decision-making and optimization processes in marketing analytics.",wos-machine learning,10,60,Accounting for Discrepancies Between Online and Offline Product Evaluations,2019
"For many decades, considerable research has been conducted on Market Response models.

"In two studies we investigate how voice shopping may provide access to meaningful data on customer mood and how retailers may use such data. In Study 1 we explores the use of a machine learning approach to predict customer mood based on customer commands in the voice shopping process. We compare it to a heuristic approach to customer mood prediction based on situational correlates of mood that that a smart speaker can access (weather, music choice, day of week, and daylight). In Study 2 we explore how a voice retailer could use the potential capability to predict customer mood. Our results provide evidence that a customer's good mood is associated with purchases of higher-priced premium brands. In addition, retailers can use mood prediction to adapt the presentation of product information to fit customer mood, thus helping customers optimize their decisions. In a sensitivity analysis, we examine what accuracy of mood prediction could enable retailers to use the explored effects. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"Social media platforms for healthcare services are changing how patients choose physicians. The digitization of healthcare reviews has been providing additional information to patients when choosing their physicians. On the other hand, the growing online information introduces more uncertainty among providers regarding the expected future demand and how different service features can affect patient decisions. In this paper, we derive various service-quality proxies from online reviews and show that leveraging textual information can derive useful operational measures to better understand patient choices. To do so, we study a unique data set from one of the leading appointment-booking websites in the United States. We derive from the text reviews the seven most frequently mentioned topics among patients, namely, bedside manner, diagnosis accuracy, waiting time, service time, insurance process, physician knowledge, and office environment, and then incorporate these service features into a random-coefficient choice model to quantify the economic values of these service-quality proxies. By introducing quality proxies from text reviews, we find the predictive power of patient choice increases significantly, for example, a 6%-1.2% improvement measured by mean squared error for both in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, our estimation results indicate that contextual description may better characterize users' perceived quality than numerical ratings on the same service feature. Broadly speaking, this paper shows how to incorporate textual information into an econometric model to understand patient choice in healthcare delivery. Our interdisciplinary approach provides a framework that combines machine learning and structural modeling techniques to advance the literature in empirical operations management, information systems, and marketing.","Xu, YQ; Armony, M; Ghose, A",Out of scope,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3879,physician; patient choice; quality; social media; text mining; sentiment; rating; review; service quality; healthcare,0.0,,0,100,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses healthcare services and patient choices, which are not related to marketing as defined.

"Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm's expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand, they increase the liquidation value of the firm's assets, which decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on the influence that the firm's suppliers have, relative to other creditors, on the bankruptcy court's decision. Advertising and R&D increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low) level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies, show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least 35%-38% (18%-21%) of the bankrupt firm's debt has been borrowed from suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point. Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially improved by considering the firm's advertising and R&D.","Jindal, N",Strategic,10.1177/0022242920936205,advertising; bankruptcy; credit; R&D; suppliers; survival,5.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term impact of advertising and R&D on a firm's bankruptcy survival and the implications of supplier influence, indicating a focus on overarching organizational goals and survival strategies.",wos-machine learning,60,20,The Impact of Advertising and R&D on Bankruptcy Survival: A Double-Edged Sword,2020
"Romania faced the highest inflation rate in the European Union at the beginning of 2024, but progress has been made compared to that in 2023 due to the increasing interest rate. This inflation stemmed from a combination of global and domestic factors (global factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and war, rising commodity prices, domestic factors such as wage and pension increases, tax and charge hikes, and a strategy of gradual increase in the monetary policy interest rate). The National Bank of Romania (NBR) uses a combination of monetary policy instruments to target inflation and provides quarterly forecasts. However, under uncertain conditions, numerical forecasts are less reliable, and the inclusion of sentiment analysis in forecasts might lead to innovation in the field by improving the prediction accuracy. Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important in the field of economics, offering valuable insights and potentially improving economic forecasting and decision-making due to rapid technological progress. Sentiment analysis can identify potential changes in consumer behaviour and business decisions before they are translated into actual economic data, providing an early warning system for economic trends and potential crises. The methodological background relies on natural language processing to extract sentiment indices for large amounts of texts in Inflation Reports provided by NBR. Moreover, the sentiment indices calculated by IntelliDocker are incorporated into autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models to provide quarterly inflation forecasts. This type of econometric model has the advantage of addressing endogeneity. Moreover, the unemployment rate is considered an inflation predictor since tensions in the labour market might impact inflation. This paper contributes to empirical forecasting by proposing sentiment forecasts that are more accurate than NBR numerical forecasts corresponding to the 2006: Q1-2023: Q4 horizon. The new forecasting method might be used to make inflation predictions for the next quarters. More accurate forecasts would be valuable for businesses, the central bank, policymakers, and the general public. However, while sentiment analysis offers valuable insights, it is important to remember that human judgment and expertise remain essential for interpreting the data and making informed economic decisions.","Simionescu, M; Nicula, AS",Strategic,10.21272/mmi.2024.2-02,inflation; forecasts; sentiment index; natural language processing,5.0,,10,5,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY","The abstract discusses long-term economic forecasting and the role of sentiment analysis in improving inflation predictions in Romania.

"The study of brand choice decisions with multiple alternatives has been successfully modelled for more than a decade using the Multinomial Legit model. Recently, neural network modelling has received increasing attention and has been applied to an array of marketing problems such as market response or segmentation. We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Legit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Legit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Legit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics. The method is illustrated on an artificial dataset where the market is heterogeneous. We then apply the approach to panel scanner data of purchase records, using the Legit to analyse the non-linearities detected by the neural network.

"This paper presents a definitive description of neural network methodology and provides an evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages relative to statistical procedures. The development of this rich class of models was inspired by the neural architecture of the human brain. These models mathematically emulate the neurophysical structure and decision making of the human brain, and, from a statistical perspective, are closely related to generalized linear models. Artificial neural networks are, however, nonlinear and use a different estimation procedure (feed forward and back propagation) than is used in traditional statistical models (least squares or maximum likelihood). Additionally, neural network models do not require the same restrictive assumptions about the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable(s). Consequently, these models have already been very successfully applied in many diverse disciplines, including biology, psychology, statistics, mathematics, business, insurance, and computer science. We propose that neural networks will prove to be a valuable tool for marketers concerned with predicting consumer choice. We will demonstrate that neural networks provide superior predictions regarding consumer decision processes. In the context of modeling consumer judgment and decision making, for example, neural network models can offer significant improvement over traditional statistical methods because of their ability to capture nonlinear relationships associated with the use of noncompensatory decision rules. Our analysis reveals that neural networks have great potential for improving model predictions in nonlinear decision contexts without sacrificing performance in linear decision contexts. This paper provides a detailed introduction to neural networks that is understandable to both the academic researcher and the practitioner. This exposition is intended to provide both the intuition and the rigorous mathematical models needed for successful applications. In particular, a step-by-step outline of: how to use the models is provided along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the model. We also address the robustness of the neural network models and discuss how far wrong you might go using neural network models versus traditional statistical methods. Herein, we report the results of two studies. The first is a numerical simulation comparing the ability of neural networks with discriminant analysis and logistic regression at predicting choices made by decision rules that vary in complexity. This includes simulations involving two noncompensatory decision rules and one compensatory decision rule that involves attribute thresholds. In particular, we test a variant of the satisficing rule used by Johnson et al. (1989) that sets a lower bound threshold on all attribute values and a latitude of acceptance model that sets both a lower threshold and an upper threshold on attribute values, mimicking an ideal point model (Coombs and Avrunin 1977). We also test a compensatory rule that equally weights attributes and judges the acceptability of an alternative based on the sum of its attribute values. Thus, the simulations include both a linear environment, in which traditional statistical models might be deemed appropriate, as well as a nonlinear environment where statistical models might not be appropriate. The complexity of the decision rules was varied to test for any potential degradation in model performance. For these simulated data it is shown that, in general, the neural network model outperforms the commonly used statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. An empirical study bridging the behavioral and statistical lines of research was also conducted. Here we examine the predictive relationship between retail store image variables and consumer patronage behavior. A direct comparison between a neural network model and the more commonly encountered techniques of discriminant analysis and factor analysis followed by logistic regression is presented. Again the results reveal that the neural network model outperformed the statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We conclude that neural network models offer superior predictive capabilities over traditional statistical methods in predicting consumer choice in nonlinear and linear settings.","West, PM; Brockett, PL; Golden, LL",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.16.4.370,consumer decision making; neural networks; statistical techniques,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the application of neural networks to predict consumer choices, which involves structured decision-making processes related to marketing analytics, predictive modeling, and consumer behavior analysis.

"In predictive modeling, firms often deal with high-dimensional data that span multiple channels, websites, demographics, purchase types, and product categories. Traditional customer response models rely heavily on feature engineering, and their performance depends on the analyst's domain knowledge and expertise to craft relevant predictors. As the complexity of data increases, however, traditional models grow exponentially complicated. In this paper, we demonstrate that long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which rely exclusively on raw data as input, can predict customer behaviors with great accuracy. In our first application, a model outperforms standard benchmarks. In a second, more realistic application, an LSTM model competes against 271 hand-crafted models that use a wide variety of features and modeling approaches. It beats 269 of them, most by a wide margin.

"Accurate prediction of stock market values is a challenging task for over decades. Prediction of stock prices is associated with numerous benefits including but not limited to helping investors make wise decisions to accumulate profits. The development of the share price is a dynamic and nonlinear process affected by several factors. What is interesting is the unpredictability of share prices due to the global financial crisis. However, classical methods are no longer sufficient for the application of share price development prediction. However, over-relying on prediction data can lead to losses in the case of software malfunction. This paper aims to innovate the prediction management when predicting the share price development over time by the use of neural networks. For the contribution, the data on the prices of CEZ, a.s. shares obtained from the Prague Stock Exchange database. The stock price data are available for the period 2012-2017. In the case of Statistica software, the multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) and the radial basis function networks (RBF) are generated. Inthe case of Matlab software, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) are generated. The networks with the best characteristics are retained and based on the statistical interpretation of the results, and all are applicable in practice. In all data sets, MLP networks show stable performance better than in the case of SVR and BPNN networks. As for the final assessment, the deviation of 2.26% occurs in the most significant differential of the maximal and the minimal prediction. It is not necessarily significant regarding the price of one stock. However, in the case of purchasing or selling a large number of stocks, the difference may seem significant. Therefore, in practice, the application of two networks is recommended: MLP 1-2-1 and MLP 1-5-1. The first network always represents a pessimistic, minimal prediction. The second one of the recommended networks is an optimistic, maximal prediction.

"This paper presents one of the possibilities of the decision theory that can be used in the modelling of the quality of life in a given city in the Czech Republic. Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city.

"Behavioral biases are known to influence the investment decisions of retail investors. Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic.","Talwar, S; Talwar, M; Tarjanne, V; Dhir, A",Out of scope,10.1002/mar.21550,artificial neural network (ANN); behavioral biases; behavioral finance; heuristic simplification; retail investors,0.0,,5,85,WILEY,"The abstract discusses behavioral biases influencing investment decisions of millennials, particularly during a health crisis, which falls under financial services rather than marketing.",wos-neural network,5,5,Why retail investors traded equity during the pandemic?

"One of the substantial challenges in marketing efforts is determining optimal markets, specifically in market segmentation. The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets. The sensitivity analysis is performed using pricing concept. The applicability of the model is illustrated in a numerical example.","Fazlollahtabar, H",Strategic,10.22059/ijms.2020.269091.673397,Information Technology (IT); Decision Support Systems (DSS); Perceptron Neural Network; Dynamic Programming (DP),5.0,,10,0,UNIV TEHRAN,"The abstract discusses the use of Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for optimal market determination and competitive advantage, which aligns with long-term strategic planning in marketing.",wos-neural network,60,25,A DSS-Based Dynamic Programming for Finding Optimal Markets Using Neural Networks and Pricing,2021
"Purpose - This study aims to explore the dynamic interplay of key resources (i.e. research and development (R&D), advertising and exports) in affecting the performance of USA manufacturing firms. Specifically, the authors examine the dynamic impact of joint resources and predict differential effect scales contingent on firm capabilities.Design/methodology/approach - This study presents a combined multiple regression analysis (MRA)-multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network modeling and investigates the complex interlinkage of capabilities, resources and performance. As an innovative approach, the MRA-MLP model investigates the effect of capabilities under the combinatory deployment of joint resources.Findings - This study finds that the impact of joint resources and synergistic rents is not uniform but rather distinctive according to the combinatory conditions and that the pattern is further shaped by firm capabilities. Accordingly, besides signifying the contingent aspect of capabilities across a range of resource combinations, the result also shows that managerial sophistication in adaptive resource control is more than a managerial ethos.Practical implications - The proposed analytic process provides scientific decision support tools with control mechanisms with respect to deploying multiple resources and setting actionable goals, thereby presenting pragmatic benchmarking options to industry managers.Originality/value - Using the theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based view (RBV) and resource orchestration, this study advances knowledge about the complex interaction of key resources by presenting a salient analytic process. The empirical design, which portrays holistic interaction patterns, adds to the uniqueness of this study of the complex interlinkages between capabilities, resources and shareholder value.","Kwon, HB; Lee, JH; Brennan, I",Strategic,10.1108/BIJ-03-2023-0183,Advertising; Capabilities; Exports; R&D; Neural network,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on the long-term impact of resource combinations on the performance of manufacturing firms, which aligns with strategic planning and decision support systems aiming to optimize organizational goals.",wos-neural network,60,20,"Complex interplay of R&D, advertising and exports in USA manufacturing firms: differential effects of capabilities",2024
"Gap analysis (GA) is one of the most popular techniques which has been widely used in service marketing to help businesses make customer satisfaction (CS) decisions through a service quality perspective. However, an assumption of a linear relationship between attribute performance and CS underlies the application of the GA approach. And this assumption is challenged by Kano's two-dimensional model which indicates the possible phenomenon of a non-linear relationship between attribute performance and CS. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to propose a novel GA approach through Kano's two-dimensional conception with the application of the neural network technique in order to extract the actual contribution offered by each attribute for CS improvement. A comparative analysis with the traditional GA approach and our proposed approach was performed by using an empirical study on a Taiwanese Human Resource service online agency. Results showed that the new proposed GA approach has higher effectiveness in reflecting the impact of gap reduced on CS improvement. This implies that the new GA approach can be considered as a helpful decision-making technique for CS decision making.

"Purpose - The aim of this study is to develop an applicable and detailed model for customer lifetime value (CLV) and to highlight the most important indicators relevant for a specific industry - namely the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the results of the least square estimation (LSE) and artificial neural network (ANN) in order to select the best performing forecasting tool to predict the potential CLV. The performances of the models are compared by the hit ratio, which is calculated by grouping the customers as top 20 per cent and bottom 80 per cent profitable. Findings - Due to its higher performance; LSE based linear regression model is selected. The results are found to be highly competitive compared with the previous studies. This study shows that, beside the indicators mostly used in the literature in measuring CLV, two additional groups, namely monetary value and risk of certain bank services, as well as product/service ownership-related indicators, are also significant factors. Practical implications - Organisations in the banking sector have to persuade their customers to use certain routine risk-bearing transaction-based services. In addition, the product development strategy has a crucial role to increase the CLV of customers because some of the product-related variables directly increase the value of customers. Originality/value - The proposed model predicts potential value of current customers rather than measuring current value considered in the majority of previous studies. It eliminates the limitations and drawbacks of the majority of models in the literature through simple and industry-specific method which is based on easily measurable and objective indicators.","Ekinci, Y; Uray, N; Ülengin, F",Tactical,10.1108/EJM-12-2011-0714,Artificial neural network; Least squares estimation; Customer lifetime value; Linear regression; Marketing decision,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on developing a specific model for customer lifetime value (CLV) within the banking sector, which involves structured decision-making related to product development and customer engagement strategies.

"Purpose The negative influence of gamification on online communities has received little attention in the available literature. The study examines the adverse effects of gamification during engaging in online communities. Design/methodology/approach Gap-spotting methods were used to develop the research questions, followed by model development using the social exchange and social-network theories. Data were collected from 429 samples. The study applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses followed by ANN application. Findings The study identified five factors related to gamification that have a significant adverse effect on the mental and emotional well-being of the users. Furthermore, the results of PLS-SEM were then compared through an artificial neural network (ANN) analytic process, revealing consistency for the model. This research presents a theoretical contribution by providing critical insights into online gamers' mental and emotional health. It implies that gamification can even bring mental and emotional disturbance. The resulting situation might lead to undesirable social consequences. Practical implications The result highlights the managerial and social relevance from the perspective of a developing country. As respondents are becoming more engrossed in online gaming, managers and decision-makers need to take preventive measures to overcome the dark side of online gaming.

"The study explores the reasons that drive and hinder consumers' willingness to migrate to the metaverse. To determine them, a mixed-methods approach is used: phase 1 (qualitative) involves conceptual development of a model based on in-depth consumer interviews, and in phase 2, the conceptual model is empirically tested via structural equation modeling. Results show that social presence is a crucial enabler, while realistic and symbolic threats are significant inhibitors of the willingness to migrate. Preusage cognitive dissonance significantly mediates the relationships between social escapism, social pressure, realistic threat, symbolic threat, and willingness to migrate. Specifically, the mediating influence between empowerment and willingness to migrate is higher for individuals with low metaverse anxiety. Results of the artificial neural network technique indicate that social presence is the most significant antecedent of willingness to migrate, and results of the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis highlight the presence of six distinct configurations that indicate a high willingness to migrate. This study enriches the behavioral reasoning theory by examining the interplay of the reasons influencing the willingness to migrate. Further, it contributes to the intergroup threat theory by investigating the potential link between willingness to migrate and the presence of realistic and symbolic threats.","Kumar, A; Shankar, A",Strategic,10.1002/mar.22009,anxiety; behavioral reasoning theory; cognitive dissonance; intergroup threat theory; metaverse; willingness to migrate,5.0,,10,5,WILEY,"The study investigates the long-term motivations and barriers regarding consumer migration to the metaverse, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making in marketing contexts.",wos-neural network,60,20,The bold decision to go all in: Understanding the reasons behind consumers' willingness to migrate to the metaverse,2024
"Purpose While there is an abundant amount of literature studies on mobile payment adoption, there is a scarce of knowledge concerning the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies. As those technologies are mainly concerned with security and users' trust, the question of how security factors and trust can influence the sustainable use of those technologies within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is still unanswered. This research thus develops a theoretical model based on integrating the protection motivation theory (PMT) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), extended with perceived trust (PT) to explore the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies. Design/methodology/approach The developed model is evaluated based on data collected through a web-based survey from 523 users who used contactless payment technologies. Unlike the existing literature, the collected data were analyzed using a hybrid structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) technique. Findings The data analysis results reinforced all the proposed relationships in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results showed that PT has the largest impact on the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies with 97.2% normalized importance, followed by self-efficacy (SE) (77%), satisfaction (72.1%), perceived vulnerability (PV) (48.9%), perceived usefulness (PU) (48.2%), perceived severity (PS) (40.7%), response efficacy (RE) (28.7%) and response costs (RCs) (24.1%). Originality/value The originality of this research lies behind the development of an integrated model based on PMT and ECM to understand the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies. The study provides several managerial implications for decision-makers, policy-makers and service providers to ensure the sustainability of those contactless technologies within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Sharafi, MA; Al-Qaysi, N; Iahad, NA; Al-Emran, M",Strategic,10.1108/IJBM-07-2021-0291,Mobile payment; Contactless technologies; Protection motivation theory; Expectation-confirmation model; Trust; PLS-SEM; Artificial neural network; COVID-19,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the development of a theoretical model integrating protection motivation theory and expectation-confirmation model to explore the sustainable use of mobile payment technologies, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",wos-neural network,70,15,Evaluating the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic using a hybrid SEM-ANN approach,2022
"Recent increase in peer-to-peer lending prompted for development of models to separate good and bad clients to mitigate risks both for lenders and for the platforms. The rapidly increasing body of literature provides several comparisons between various models. Among the most frequently employed ones are logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, neural networks and decision tree-based models. Among them, logistic regression has proved to be a strong candidate both because its good performance and due to its high explainability. The present paper aims to compare four pairs of models (for imbalanced and under-sampled data) meant to predict charged off clients by optimizing F1 score. We found that, if the data is balanced, Logistic Regression, both simple and with Stochastic Gradient Descent, outperforms LightGBM and K-Nearest Neighbors in optimizing F1 score. We chose this metric as it provides balance between the interests of the lenders and those of the platform. Loan term, debt-toincome ratio and number of accounts were found to be important positively related predictors of risk of charge off. At the other end of the spectrum, by far the strongest impact on charge off probability is that of the FICO score. The final number of features retained by the two models differs very much, because, although both models use Lasso for feature selection, Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic Regression uses a stronger regularization. The analysis was performed using Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn and imblearn).","Caplescu, RD; Panaite, AM; Pele, DT; Strat, VA",Out of scope,10.2478/mmcks-2020-0023,peer-to-peer lending; creditworthiness; Logistic Regression; KNN; LightGBM,0.0,,0,100,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses models for predicting credit risk in peer-to-peer lending, which falls under financial services rather than marketing.",wos-neural network,0,0,Will they repay their debt?

"This article discusses a model designed to help sales representatives acquire customers in a business-to-business environment. Sales representatives are often overwhelmed by available information, so they use arbitrary rules to select leads to pursue. The goal of the proposed model is to generate a high-quality list of prospects that are easier to convert into leads and ultimately customers in three phases: Phase I occurs when there is only information on the current customer base and uses the nearest neighbor method to obtain predictions. As soon as there is information on companies that did not become customers, phase 2 initiates, triggering a feedback loop to optimize and stabilize the model. This phase uses logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Phase 3 combines phases 1 and 2 into a weighted list of prospects. Preliminary tests indicate the good quality of the model. The study makes two theoretical contributions: First, the authors offer a standardized version of the customer acquisition framework, and second, they point out the iterative aspects of this process.

"We present an empirical framework for creating dynamic coupon targeting strategies for high-dimensional and high-frequency settings, and we test its performance using a large-scale field experiment. The framework captures consumers' intertemporal tradeoffs associated with dynamic pricing and does not rely on functional form assumptions about consumers' decision-making processes. The model is estimated using batch deep reinforcement learning (BDRL), which relies on Q-learning, a model free solution that can mitigate model bias. It leverages deep neural networks to represent the high-dimensional state space and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The empirical application is in a multibillion-dollar livestream shopping context. Our BDRL solution increases the platform's revenue by twice as much as static targeting policies and by 20% more than the model-based solution. The comparative advantage of BDRL comes from more effective and automatic targeting of consumers based on both heterogeneity and dynamics, using exceptionally rich, nuanced differences among consumers and across time. We find that price skimming, reducing discounts for attractive hosts, and increasing the coupon discount level at a faster rate for low spenders are effective strategies based on dynamics, consumer heterogeneity, and the two combined, respectively.","Liu, X",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2022.1403,dynamic pricing; coupon; deep reinforcement learning; reference price; livestream shopping; targeting,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes the development and execution of a dynamic coupon targeting strategy that interprets strategic goals into actionable targeting policies.

"Since the first bankruptcy prediction models developed in the 60th of 20th century numerous different models have been constructed through the world. These individual models for bankruptcy prediction have been created in different time and space using different methods and variables. During this period various statistical methods have been used starting with the most popular univariate, linear and multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, probit regression, decision trees, neural networks, rough sets, linear programming, principal component analysis, data envelopment analysis, survival analysis and so on. Therefore, we aim to provide deep insight and analyse the bankruptcy prediction models developed in countries of Visegrad four, with the emphasis on methods applied and explanatory variables used in these models, and evaluate them through appropriate statistical methods. Specifically, cluster analysis to explore the differences between basic groups of financial indicators and designed clusters of explanatory variables. Based on the analysis of more than one hundred bankruptcy prediction models we can conclude the most used variables, which serves as a basis for further research and development of prediction models in Visegrad group countries. Three clusters were developed which representing various explanatory variables while these clusters differ from basic groups of financial indicators. According to detected clusters we recommend to choose the most frequently used variables from each created cluster. From the cluster one revenues from sales/total assets ratio; from the cluster two the construction of models should contain current ratio, and from the cluster three we recommend to use ROE.

"This study assesses the feasibility of identifying self-reported sports practitioners (soccer players) on Facebook. The main goal is to develop a system to support marketers with the decision as to which prospects to target for advertising purposes. To do so, we benchmark several algorithms (i.e., random forest, logistic regression, adaboost, rotation forest, neural networks, and kernel factory) using five times twofold cross-validation. To evaluate performance and variable importances, we build a fusion model, which combines the results of the other algorithms using the weighted average. This technique is also referred to as information-fusion sensitivity analysis. The results reveal that Facebook data provide a viable basis to come up with sports predictions as the predictive performance ranges from 72.01% to 80.43% for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), from 81.96% to 83.95% for accuracy, and from 2.41 to 3.06 for top-decile lift. Our benchmark study indicates that stochastic adaboost, the fusion model, random forest, rotation forest, and regularized logistic regression are the best-performing algorithms. Furthermore, the results show that the most important variables are the average number of friends that play soccer, membership of a soccer group, and the number of favorite teams. We also assess the impact of our results on profitability by conducting a thorough sensitivity analysis. Our analysis reveals that our approach can be beneficial for a wide range of companies.

"Forecasting the demand of network of retail sales is a rather challenging task, especially nowadays where integration of online and physical store orders creates an abundance of data that has to be efficiently stored, analyzed, understood and finally, become ready to be acted upon in a very short time frame. The challenge becomes even bigger for added-value third party logistics (3PL) operators, since in most cases and demand forecasting aside, they are also responsible for receiving, storing and breaking inbound quantities from suppliers, consolidating and picking retail orders and finally plan and organize shipments on a daily basis. This paper argues that data analytics can play a critical role in contemporary logistics and especially in demand data management and forecasting of retail distribution networks. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to showcase how data analytics can support the 3PL decision making process on replenishing the network stores, thus improving inventory management in both Distribution Centre (DC) and retail outlet levels and the workload planning of human resources and DC automations. To do so, this paper presents the case of a Greek 3PL provider fulfilling physical store and online orders on behalf of a large sporting goods importer operating a network of 129 stores in five different countries. The authors utilize the power of 'R', a statistical programming language, which is well-equipped with a multitude of libraries for this purpose, to compare demand forecasting methods and identify the one producing the smallest forecast error.","Lalou, P; Ponis, ST; Efthymiou, OK",Tactical,10.2478/mmcks-2020-0012,Demand Forecasting Decision Making; Data Analytics; Statistical Programming; Retail Sales; Third Party Logistics (3PL) Operators,5.0,,15,0,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses how data analytics can support decision-making processes in demand forecasting and inventory management for retail distribution networks.

"Increasing rivalry for-profit or non-profit is pushing companies to devote more and more attention to pleasing consumers with excellent quality customer services. This study aims to develop a model to analyse customer behaviour in a retail store and provide accurate inference for decision making. Another critical objective for this research work is the adaptation of the faceted form of neuro-response, which is substituted by the Adaptive Fuzzy Logistic Regression Model (AFLRM). AFLRM has resulting benefits over Neuro-surface and Mean Demand Heuristic methods. A sample of 100 customers who visited or walked in the retails was used as a sample. Other than neuro-response surfaces (NRSM) and The Mean Demand Heuristic models (MDSM), the present study has accustomed a generalized form known as Adaptive Fuzzy Linear Regression Model (AFLRM) to deliver the benchmark for former models and give the highest level of accuracy for future behaviour of a customer. LINGO based Markovian analysis has also been used with the above model to understand the behaviour of the system understudy. The significance of service and product attributes is implicitly derived via the fuzzy regression model for customer satisfaction measurement. It is observed that the critical gap between the quality of product and services and Customer Satisfaction is Product/Service Satisfaction, Motivation and Buying Experience, and Credibility and Security. The authors' finding indicates that the effort of listening to the customer's voice should be more critical. Result analysis based on computational results concerning the questionnaire for measuring the customer behaviour and the system validates the model under study. Appropriate, useful with reliable action plans for every critical product and service aspect can be developed by applying the adaptive regression methodology to control the quality of service or managing the customer satisfaction, thereby providing executives with a competitive gain.

"Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample.

The proposed framework aims to eliminate the limitations and drawbacks of the majority of models encountered in the literature through a simple and industry-specific model with easily measurable and objective indicators. In addition, this model predicts the potential value of the current customers rather than measuring the current value, which has generally been used in the majority of previous studies. This study contributes to the literature by helping to make future marketing decisions via Markov decision processes for a company that offers several types of products. Another contribution is that the states for Markov decision processes are also generated using the predicted customer lifetime values where the prediction is realized by a regression-based model. Finally, a real world application of the proposed model is provided in the banking sector to show the empirical validity of the model. Therefore, we believe that the proposed framework and the developed model can guide both practitioners and researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors.","Harmeling, CM; Palmatier, RW; Fang, E; Wang, DW",Strategic,10.1509/jm.15.0495,group marketing; group dynamics; conforming purchase behavior; dynamic group influence; group norms,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The research addresses fundamental psychological mechanisms of group influence on customer behavior, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and understanding market dynamics.

"Decision trees and logistic regression are two very popular algorithms in customer churn prediction with strong predictive performance and good comprehensibility. Despite these strengths, decision trees tend to have problems to handle linear relations between variables and logistic regression has difficulties with interaction effects between variables. Therefore a new hybrid algorithm, the logit leaf model (LLM), is proposed to better classify data. The idea behind the LLM is that different models constructed on segments of the data rather than on the entire dataset lead to better predictive performance while maintaining the comprehensibility from the models constructed in the leaves. The LLM consists of two stages: a segmentation phase and a prediction phase. In the first stage customer segments are identified using decision rules and in the second stage a model is created for every leaf of this tree. This new hybrid approach is benchmarked against decision trees, logistic regression, random forests and logistic model trees with regards to the predictive performance and comprehensibility. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and top decile lift (TDL) are used to measure the predictive performance for which LLM scores significantly better than its building blocks logistic regression and decision trees and performs at least as well as more advanced ensemble methods random forests and logistic model trees. Comprehensibility is addressed by a case study for which we observe some key benefits using the LLM compared to using decision trees or logistic regression. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling underpins modern marketing analytics, enabling the development of tailored customer relationship management strategies based on the predicted future value of their customers. As part of Amperity's enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing out of the box. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns.

"In recent years, parastatal grain marketing boards have re-emerged as important elements of grain markets in eastern and southern Africa, yet little is known about how farmers are responding to their scaled up activities. This article develops a conceptual model of farmers' production decisions in the context of dual output marketing channels (government and private sector) when output prices at harvest time and the availability of one of the marketing channels are unknown at planting time. It then applies the model to the case of Zambia and uses nationally representative household-level panel survey data to estimate the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the government parastatal maize marketing board, on smallholder crop production and fallow land. The FRA buys maize from smallholders at a pan-territorial price that typically exceeds market prices in major maize producing areas. Results suggest that increases in the farmgate FRA maize price raise farmer maize price expectations, which induces a supply response. Smallholders respond to an increase in the FRA price by extensifying their maize production. On average, a 1% increase in the FRA price is associated with 0.06% increases in smallholders' maize area planted and quantity harvested. There is also some evidence that farmers reduce the area of land under fallow in response to FRA incentives but there is no evidence of reductions in the area planted to other crops.","Mason, NM; Jayne, TS; Myers, RJ",Tactical,10.1111/1477-9552.12066,Grain marketing boards; maize; price expectations; strategic grain reserves; sub-Saharan Africa; supply response; Zambia,5.0,,15,0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,"The abstract discusses farmers' production decisions in response to government pricing incentives and market dynamics.

"Significant changes of business environment that impact not only the activity of companies but the shift of the basic values and attitudes of the society have been observed recently. The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and clean products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.","Banyte, J; Brazioniene, L; Gadeikiene, A",Strategic,,green marketing; corporate social responsibility; green consumer; Lithuanian market of eco-friendly food products,5.0,,5,0,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,The abstract discusses significant changes in consumer attitudes towards eco-friendly products and the need for businesses to integrate corporate social responsibility into their marketing strategies.

"Facing the challenge of attracting consumers and winning market share under the proliferation of TV stations and channels, the traditional TV stations often make some marketing strategies. However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies. Managerial implications are then discussed to guide the decision-making of traditional TV broadcasters and advertisers. (C) 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

"This article investigates member deliveries in agricultural marketing cooperatives. Since cooperatives depend on members' contributions to achieve efficiency in processing and marketing, side-selling by members poses a threat to the economic viability of cooperatives in the long run. We develop a model for the farmers' marketing decision that relates farm size to the share of produce delivered to the cooperative. Based on survey data from cooperatively organised coffee farmers in Costa Rica, we find that the share delivered to cooperatives decreases with farm size, albeit at a decreasing rate. The empirical results thus confirm the theoretical model prediction of a u-shaped relationship between farm size and member deliveries.","Wollni, M; Fischer, E",Strategic,10.1093/erae/jbu023,cooperatives; patronage; side-selling; coffee; Costa Rica,5.0,,10,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"The article discusses member deliveries in agricultural marketing cooperatives, focusing on the long-term economic viability of these organizations, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making.",wos-prediction,70,10,Member deliveries in collective marketing relationships: evidence from coffee cooperatives in Costa Rica,2015
"How do people make choices when they see two equally positive versus two equally negative decision alternatives? The cancel-and-focus hypothesis argues that when people see options in a sequence, they tend to overweight the unique attributes of the first alternative. This leads to the prediction that when both options are positive (approach-approach conflict), the first option is preferred more but that if they are both negative (avoidance-avoidance conflict), the first option is preferred less. Based on recent research, we argue that this finding may be contingent on an unrecognized compatibility confound with the decision frame of choosing versus rejecting. In this research, we argue that the choice biases predicted by the cancel-and-focus hypothesis will be more pronounced when the decision frame (choose/reject) is incompatible with the valence of the alternatives (reject-positive and choose-negative) because such incompatibility increases processing motivation. We report two studies with varying operationalizations of decision conflict which find that cancel-and-focus effects are more pronounced under incompatibility. Taken together, these findings suggest that conflict effects are better understood by accounting for the decision frame as well.","Krishnamurthy, P; Nagpal, A",Not identified,10.1007/s11002-009-9079-0,Decision frame; Decision conflict; Approach-approach; Avoidance-avoidance; Compatibility,75.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses decision-making processes and theoretical hypotheses rather than concrete examples or applications in marketing, making it difficult to classify within the provided categories.",wos-prediction,10,5,Making choices under conflict: The impact of decision frames,2010
"The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%-6% in transactions' prices. Our results lend ample support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic behavior.","Mantin, B; Rubin, E",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2015.0965,strategic consumers; decision support; revenue management; information availability; airline industry,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the impact of consumer behavior on pricing strategies and the use of decision support tools, which align with long-term strategic planning and pricing decisions.",wos-prediction,60,25,Fare Prediction Websites and Transaction Prices: Empirical Evidence from the Airline Industry,2016
"Investments in new marketing offerings are notoriously risky, as they require firms to make judgments about an uncertain future. The authors develop an option-thinking framework for valuing and selecting new marketing offerings that combines real-options theory with virtual markets. They apply the framework and demonstrate its power empirically in the context of experiential content, where valuing marketing offerings constitutes a particularly challenging issue. Specifically, they test the proposed option-thinking framework in two experiential settings (movies and professional team sports) and compare it to current managerial practice. Each experiential setting deals with a common managerial marketing challenge. Study 1 examines extending a brand into a new category, and Study 2 investigates ingredient branding.

"Consumers display an expense prediction bias in which they underpredict their future spending. The authors propose this bias occurs in large part because (1) consumers base their predictions on typical expenses that come to mind easily during prediction, (2) taken together, typical expenses lead to a prediction near the mode of a consumer's expense distribution rather than the mean, and (3) expenses display positive skew (with mode < mean). Accordingly, the authors also propose that prompting consumers to consider reasons why their expenses might be different than usual increases predictions-and therefore prediction accuracy-by bringing atypical expenses to mind. Ten studies (N = 6,044) provide support for this account of the bias and the atypical intervention developed to neutralize it.","Howard, RC; Hardisty, DJ; Sussman, AB; Lukas, MF",Tactical,10.1177/00222437211068025,expense prediction bias; consumer financial decision making; budgeting; accessibility; typicality; skewness,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses consumer expense prediction bias and proposes an intervention to improve prediction accuracy, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, particularly in areas like purchase prediction and marketing analytics.",wos-prediction,10,70,"Understanding and Neutralizing the Expense Prediction Bias: The Role of Accessibility, Typicality, and Skewness",2022
"Purpose - Retailers realize that customer churn detection is a critical success factor. However, no research study has taken into consideration that misclassifying a customer as a non-churner (i.e. predicting that (s)he will not leave the company, while in reality (s) he does) results in higher costs than predicting that a staying customer will churn. The aim of this paper is to examine the prediction performance of various cost-sensitive methodologies (direct minimum expected cost (DMECC), metacost, thresholding and weighting) that incorporate these different costs of misclassifying customers in predicting churn. Design/methodology/approach - Cost-sensitive methodologies are benchmarked on six real-life churn datasets from the retail industry. Findings - This article argues that total misclassification cost, as a churn prediction evaluation measure, is crucial as input for optimizing consumer decision making. The practical classification threshold of 0.5 for churn probabilities (i.e. when the churn probability is greater than 0.5, the customer is predicted as a churner, and otherwise as a non-churner) offers the worst performance. The provided managerial guidelines suggest when to use each cost-sensitive method, depending on churn levels and the cost level discrepancy between misclassifying churners versus non-churners. Practical implications - This research emphasizes the importance of cost-sensitive learning to improve customer retention management in the retail context.

"Market analyzers use different parameters as features in the market data to analyze the market trends. The feature's values act as a signal to market fluctuations. Many studies have examined these features to predict market movement more effectively. However, the method to minimize the uncertainties associated with the features is not available in the literature. This exploratory study introduces the uncertainty optimization based feature selection method for stock marketing. We introduce a notion of certainty region of the feature as the set of feature values, which signify particular happening with certainty. We use rough set theory to find the feature's certainty region and uncertainty region and measure each feature's significance. The feature whose certainty region is the maximum is the most significant in the feature space. Hence we group the features by minimizing the uncertainty region of the most informative features to get feature subsets for feature selection. We propose an algorithm based on uncertainty optimization to find subsets of the feature set for effectiveness and performance enhancement in the feature selection. We obtain the decision rules with comprehensive coverage and excellent support using the selected features. The accuracy of classification using the chosen parameters is up to 85.91%, which is higher than 79.54% of the complete feature set.

"While customer management has become a top priority for practitioners and academics, little is known about how managers actually make customer management decisions. Our study addresses this gap and uses the adaptive decision maker as well as the fast and frugal heuristics frameworks to gain a better understanding of managerial decision making. Using the process-tracing tool MouselabWEB, we presented sales managers in retail banking with three typical customer management prediction tasks. The results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a significant increase in accuracy.

"Orientation: Business rescue has become a critical part of business strategy decision making, especially during economic downturns and recessions. Past legislation has generally supported creditor-friendly regimes, and its mind-set still applies, which increases the difficulty of such turnarounds. There are many questions and critical issues faced by those involved in rescue. Despite extensive theory in the literature on failure, there is a void regarding practical verifiers of the signs and causes of venture decline, as specialists are not forthcoming about what they regard as their 'intellectual property'. Research purpose: This article introduces the concept and role of 'verifier determinants' of early warning signs, as a tool to confirm the causes of decline in order to direct rescue strategies and, most importantly, reduce time between the first observation and the implementation of the rescue. Motivation for the study: Knowing how specialists confirm causes of business decline in practice could assist in analysis and deciding on strategies for the rescue earlier than can be done using traditional due diligence, which is time consuming. Reducing time is a crucial element of a successful rescue. Research design and approach: The researchers interviewed specialists with extensive experience in credit for rescue and turnaround. An experimental design was used to ensure the specialists evaluated the same real cases to extract their experiences and base their decisions on. Main findings: The specialists confirmed the use of verifier determinants and identified such determinants as they personally used them to confirm causes of decline. These verifier determinants were classified into five categories namely, management, finance, strategic, banking and operations and marketing of the ventures under investigation. The verifier determinants and their use often depend heavily on subconscious (non-factual) information based on previous experiences, rendering them 'irrational' in modern management perspectives. Practical/managerial implications: Decision makers and affected persons could benefit from the insights obtained through this study. Confirming early warning signs through verifier determinants would be beneficial for entrepreneurs who are creditors, company directors, rescue practitioners, government regulators, court officials and educators alike. Contribution/value add: Knowing the verifier determinants could assist decision making and improve the effectiveness of rescue strategies. Business rescue practitioners can improve their 'investigation of the affairs' activity by using such verifier determinants.","Pretorius, M; Holtzhauzen, G",Strategic,10.4102/sajems.v16i4.450,Turnaround; business rescue; decision making; verifier determinants,5.0,,10,5,AOSIS,"The abstract discusses the role of verifier determinants in early warning signs of business decline, which relates to long-term decision-making strategies for business rescue.

"Consumers base many decisions on affective forecasts, i.e., predictions about future emotions. These predictions, however, are susceptible to systematic biases. The present paper examines the accuracy of predicting emotional change in the consumer context. The goals of the study were to examine whether predictions of a change in consumption-related emotions fit actual experienced change and whether original predictions are remembered correctly. A two-wave longitudinal survey with 86 consumers in Austria and the UK showed that consumers who had bought shoes overestimated the decrease of positive consumption-related emotions over time. Results indicate that the intuitive theory of adaptation is related to the prediction bias. Moreover, participants misremembered original predictions as more consistent with actual experienced emotions.

"Word of mouth has long been recognized to be an influential variable in marketing. With the growth of Internet applications, traditional word of mouth has evolved into the online form in a variety of Web-based outlets where individuals spread their perceptions via the written word. These expressions are often in the form of online reviews or assessments of products and services. In this article, we attempt to use features to represent reviews, which contain the sentiments of the consumers, and to predict the overall attitudes of online reviews of the consumers. Further, we want to look at which words are indicative/decision driven of a positive/negative attitude of the consumers, especially we want to identify a set of features which will result in a desired class-positive attitude in our case. Data was collected from a well-known web site using a WebCrawler type technique and we applied text-mining approach for the analysis. The overall results compare favorably with those from standard numeric based quantitative prediction methods. In addition, the text-mining methodology and inverse classification help us identify the key features that are related to positive/negative overall attitudes of online users.

"In order to boost sales in foreign markets and compete with emerging local competitors, global companies from developed countries are realizing that they need to develop products specifically for the local markets. Meanwhile, companies in developing nations are building up their design staff and seeking to establish their own global brands. This recent growth in design activity targeting overseas markets suggests the need for academic research to better understand the phenomenon of design expertise transfer across national borders. The present research explores industrial designers' expertise transfer across cultures with respect to knowledge calibration. Based on the literature on expertise and Shanteau's theory of expert competence, several hypotheses are developed regarding the main effect of culture, and the interaction between culture and expertise level, on design confidence and prediction accuracy. A three-phase experimental study is conducted to test the hypotheses. Results suggest that both expert designers and non-expert designers are poorly calibrated and overconfident. Nonetheless, expert designers are better calibrated when designing products for a foreign market than for their home market.

"Probabilistic choice models that include choice-attributes are increasingly being utilized by decision makers, particularly in the business area. The output of these models are point estimates of the coefficients of the choice-attributes and rate of correct prediction. Accuracy measures of these point estimates are either based upon the asymptotic properties of the estimation procedures or are not provided. This paper indicates that bootstrap is a method by which the assumption of asymptotic properties can be empirically validated for a given model and can provide measures of accuracy on point estimates where currently no such measure exists. The empirical application of bootstrap to a real world data set indicates that decision makers will have considerably more information about their problem than is currently provided in the point estimates of the choice model. Managerial strategy and actions taken based upon the additional information may be quite different from actions suggested by the point estimates alone.","SOOFI, ES; GENSCH, DH",Operational,10.1016/0377-2217(94)90112-0,COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; DECISION; MARKETING; RESEARCH; STATISTICS,5.0,,60,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"The abstract discusses the use of probabilistic choice models and the application of bootstrap methods to improve decision-making accuracy in business contexts.

"Successful private club management requires multiple leadership skill sets and managerial capabilities including but not limited to; relational marketing efforts, quality service delivery, financial/asset management, member enrollment, and member retention activities. Given the uniqueness of private club industry ownership and member governance oversight, this places a premium on member relationships and financial performance. This study set out to uncover new ways of analyzing private-club member behavioral patterns utilizing decision-tree analyses to predict private-club member resignation patterns. Results indicated that non-revenue-generating private club events are the best predictors of member resignation within 120 days of departure. These findings provide new insight into customer behavioral patterns associated with relational marketing practices in private clubs and provide club managers with practical ways to improve member retention strategies.","Maier, TA; Prusty, S",Tactical,10.1080/19368623.2016.1113904,churn analysis; member retention; relational marketing; private clubs,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the analysis of member behavioral patterns in private clubs and suggests actionable insights for improving member retention strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific targets based on strategic goals.",wos-prediction,10,70,Managing Customer Retention in Private Clubs Using Churn Analysis: Some Empirical Findings,2016
"PurposeClimate change-induced weather changes are severe and frequent, making it difficult to predict apparel sales. The primary goal of this study was to assess consumers' responses to winter apparel searches when external stimuli, such as weather, calendars and promotions arise and to develop a decision-making tool that allows apparel retailers to establish sales strategies according to external stimuli.Design/methodology/approachThe theoretical framework of this study was the effect of external stimuli, such as calendar, promotion and weather, on seasonal apparel search in a consumer's decision-making process. Using weather observation data and Google Trends over the past 12 years, from 2008 to 2020, consumers' responses to external stimuli were analyzed using a classification and regression tree to gain consumer insights into the decision process. The relative importance of the factors in the model was determined, a tree model was developed and the model was tested.FindingsWinter apparel searches increased when the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, windchill, and the previous day's windchill decreased. The month of the year varies depending on weather factors, and promotional sales events do not increase search activities for seasonal apparel. However, sales events during the higher-than-normal temperature season triggered search activity for seasonal apparel.Originality/valueConsumer responses to external stimuli were analyzed through classification and regression trees to discover consumer insights into the decision-making process to improve stock management because climate change-induced weather changes are unpredictable.","Oh, J",Tactical,10.1108/JFMM-12-2022-0266,Decision tree; Weather change; Consumer search; Seasonal apparel,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on assessing consumer responses to external stimuli affecting winter apparel searches, aiming to develop a decision-making tool for retailers.

"Research shows that commitment-based interventions are among the most effective strategies to encourage pro-environmental behaviors, but methods to elicit commitments from a large number of individuals (i.e., door-to-door or phone campaigns) are often costly and unrealistic. Predictions requests-a commitment-type strategy-are an effective mass-communication strategy and have the potential to influence pro-environmental behavior among large audiences. This research is the first to demonstrate that prediction requests in a consumer behavior context influence preference for environmentally friendly products. In addition, this research examines the role of individual and contextual factors in influencing the efficacy of prediction requests. Study 1 shows that exposure to an advertisement with a prediction request leads to increased preferences for environmentally sustainable (vs. traditional) household cleaning products, compared to a control advertisement, and that this effect is greater when the prediction request is paired with an audience cue (vs. prediction request only). Study 2 indicates that the effect of prediction requests on preference for sustainable products is greater for individuals with interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal. Substantive implications and directions for future research are discussed.","Bodur, HO; Duval, KM; Grohmann, B",Tactical,10.1007/s10551-014-2143-6,Sustainability in marketing; Ethical consumption; Ethical attributes; Self-prophecy; Self-construal; Social influence; Social responsibility,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The research focuses on specific methods (prediction requests) to influence consumer preferences for environmentally friendly products, aligning with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving marketing goals.",wos-prediction,10,70,Will You Purchase Environmentally Friendly Products?
