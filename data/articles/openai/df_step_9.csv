Travellers' behavioral intentions depending on their beliefs: an empirical study,Pantouvakis A.,2013,10.1108/17566691311316211,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is threefold: first is to study and analyse the personal beliefs of the customers regarding their generic assessments for the main issues of today: environment, culture or equal opportunities for everyone. Second, it will attempt to compare the differing opinions different customers from several countries possess. Finally, it is to relate, link and model the influence these opinions may have on the country selection made by the tourist. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is drawn from a sample of approximately 1,600 customers/tourists who visited Crete island. Those in the sample were from ten different countries of origin. The research attempts to shed some light on the importance of travellers' beliefs by using the multinomial logistic model that tested whether it can produce results for prediction and comparisons. Findings – Results suggest that tourist beliefs can be categorized in three factors, namely country's characteristics, tradition and hygiene that are differentiated among nationality groups. No robust support is provided for any relationship between travellers' values and country selection and thus arguing for further research in tourism marketing and policy. Practical implications – By using the findings of this work, hotel managers and tour operators can identify the multicultural diversity of international tourists. Originality/value – This work addresses the ways with which customers by using their personal beliefs select destinations (countries). It diverts from the mainstream relevant literature that focuses almost solely on the level of satisfaction or the level of service the customer enjoys. One of the issues that remains rather neglected is the importance that personal characteristics and attributes of the tourist/customer influence the final decision on where to spend his/her holidays. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Greece; Personal beliefs; Tourism marketing; Values,,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the analysis of customer beliefs and their influence on destination selection, which translates into actionable insights for hotel managers and tour operators.

Influence of Loss Aversion on NCAA Men's Basketball Bracket Predictions; [损失规避心理对美国大学男子篮球联赛对阵表预测行为的影响],Yim B.H.; Byon K.K.,2018,10.1080/24704067.2017.1411163,"The NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, known to fans as March Madness, is one of the most popular annual sporting events in the United States. Despite its economic impact on the sport industry, relatively few studies have examined phenomena associated with March Madness bracketology. The few existing studies have focused on making accurate tournament predictions rather than examining bracketology in ways that might assist sport marketers. To fill this void, the current study applied loss aversion theory to the decision-making process of NCAA tournament bracket participants.

The general theory of behavioral pricing: Applying complexity theory to explicate heterogeneity and achieve high-predictive validity,Woodside A.G.,2015,10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.02.004,"Building behavioral-pricing models-in-contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. The general theory of behavioral strategy includes a set of tenets that describes alternative configurations of decision processes and objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments associating with different outcomes involving specific price-points. This article explicates these tenets and discusses empirical studies which support the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytical tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, ethnographic decision-tree-modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis). The general theory of behavioral pricing involves the blending of cognitive science, complexity theory, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices. Consequently, behavioral pricing theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only price-setting. Capturing and reporting contextually-driven alternative routines to price setting by a compelling set of tenets represent what is particularly new and valuable about the general theory.

Direct mailing decisions based on the worst and best practice cross-efficiency evaluations,Mahdiloo M.; Noorizadeh A.; Saen R.F.,2013,10.1504/IJBIS.2013.056138,"The problem argued in the literature of direct mailing decisions generally contains three parts: 1) forecasting customers' future purchase/non-purchase responses; 2) evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for increasing customers purchase responses; 3) prioritising the customers in terms of their values. A significant body of the literature has been dedicated to the first two components, and in particular, to purchase/non-purchase prediction modelling. However, in the current paper, we do not address these two components, but rather we focus on the third component. To this end, data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique and particularly cross-efficiency formulation of the best practice frontier Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) (Charnes et al., 1978) (BPF-CCR) is used to determine those customers who should be put on the first priorities of marketing mailing list. In addition, the cross-efficiency formulation of worst practice frontier CCR (WPF-CCR) is developed to exclude the worst customers from mailing list and save the mailing expenses for the best practice ones.

An integrated model for predicting consumer's intention to write online reviews,Dixit S.; Jyoti Badgaiyan A.; Khare A.,2019,10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.10.001,"For marketers, consumers’ increasing use of online reviews in arriving at purchase decisions is a double edged sword. On one hand, it presents opportunity for manufacturers and sellers to be highlighted for their good work, but at the same time, there remains a possibility of negative review impacting goodwill and reputation. Hence, it is important for managers to identify factors that impact consumers’ intentions to write online reviews. This research delves into this aspect by trying to identify the factors that impact reviews writing intentions of consumers for restaurants. The study extends the theory of planned behaviour with additions of variables such as ego involvement, taking vengeance and helping a restaurant. For this, 252 valid responses were obtained, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model.

Econometric assessment of customers’ personality biases and communication preferences correlation; [Ekonometrické zhodnocení korelace chyb osobnosti u zákazníků a komunikačních preferencí],Kostelić K.; Pavlović D.K.,2018,10.15240/tul/001/2018-3-009,"The tendency of bias identification and quantification with the goal of better estimation and prediction, grows. The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer’s personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers’ communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents.

Performance-measurement system design and functional strategic decision influence: The role of performance-measure properties,Artz M.; Homburg C.; Rajab T.,2012,10.1016/j.aos.2012.07.001,"Although conceptual research in the accounting literature suggests that the use of performance-measurement systems affects the influence of organizational actors, empirical evidence for this suggestion is largely limited to anecdotal evidence and a few qualitative case studies. Drawing on institutional theory, we develop predictions that link the use of performance measures to the influence of functional subunits in strategic decision making. Our research model tests the effects of two types of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence: (1) decision-facilitating use and (2) use for accountability. Moreover, we propose that the effects of using performance measures for these two purposes depend on the reliability and functional specificity of the measures the functional subunits use. We empirically test our hypotheses and a research question with survey data from 192 marketing directors of German firms. We find that the effect of performance-measure use on functional strategic decision influence depends on the two properties of the performance measures. We find no significant effects when these properties are not considered. However, decision-facilitating use of performance measures has a positive effect on functional strategic decision influence when the measures are specific to the functional subunit. With respect to the use of performance measures for accountability we find countervailing effects, as the effect on functional strategic decision influence is positive when the measures are more reliable but negative when they are more specific to the functional subunit. We discuss these findings in light of existing evidence and theory. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the influence of performance-measurement systems on strategic decision-making within organizations, linking it to long-term goals and overall organizational structure.

What factors explain the price of top quality wines?,Ferro G.; Benito Amaro I.,2018,10.1108/IJWBR-05-2017-0036,"Purpose: Given the growing supply of wines and the large number of new consumers with purchasing power but lacking knowledge of the subtleties of high-quality wines, expert opinions are used for consumers as proxies for quality. This study aims to determine the determinants of prices in top-quality wine market. The authors also seek to estimate the role for country of origin, grape, producing region and winery in prices. And, finally, the authors try to show how countries, regions and wineries can help increase their position in international rankings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors try to answer: What factors explain the price of top-quality wines (defined as best rated in a standardized ranking)? To some extent, in the hands of producers influence prices, which imply long-term decisions or large investments in land and marketing. Other variables that consumer value does affect prices. The authors try also to detect undervalued or overvalued wines, grapes, regions, wineries or producer countries. The authors estimate an econometric model of hedonic prices using a 14-year sample of the Wine Spectator’s 100 top-rated wines for the American market between 2003 and 2016, totaling 1,400 observations. The sample is a great cross-section because each wine is unique. Findings: The authors’ contribution is twofold: the determination of the price explanatory values and the identification and attribution of price differences by country, grape, region and winery. Also, the authors detected grapes, countries, regions and wineries which are overvalued or undervalued with respect to the average prediction of the model. Research limitations/implications: The findings are useful to understand the role of price explanatory variables, as well as for making policy and managerial decisions. From the model, collective or managerial actions can be derived to increase particular wines’ positions in international rankings. The proxy for “quality” in the study is not the only possible definition. Practical implications: In some cases, managerial choices could be conditioned by the policies or history. There is some room for collective action and public policies to improve regions’ and countries’ reputation. Social implications: There are clear synergies for policies that can raise the prestige of countries and regions and their spillovers on the brand name reputation of individual wineries.

A fuzzy-oriented sentic analysis to capture the human emotion in Web-based content,Loia V.; Senatore S.,2014,10.1016/j.knosys.2013.09.024,"Capturing the sentiments and the emotional states enclosed in textual information is a critical task which embraces a wide range of web-oriented activities such as detecting the sentiments associated to the product reviews, developing marketing programs that would be attractive for users, enhancing customer service with respect to its expectation until to identifying new opportunities and financial market prediction, besides managing reputations. Opinions and the emotions that are embedded in them, play a key role in decision-making processes, with different effects depending on the negative or positive valence of the mood. When the choice depends on some important features (i.e., time, money, reliability/efficacy, etc.) and on other opinions (which come from previous experience), could be crucial to make the best decision. Inferring opinions and emotions enclosed in the written language is a complex task which cannot rely on body languages (posture, gestures, vocal inflections), rather than discovering concepts with an affective valence. The role of opinions extracted by the social content is crucial to support consumers' decision process; in addition, thanks opinions and emotions, it is possible to evidence improvements on existing decision supports and show how the opinion-mining techniques can be incorporated into these systems. This paper presents a tentative contribution that addresses this issue: it introduces a framework for extracting the emotions and the sentiments expressed in the textual data. The sentiments are expressed by a positive or negative polarity, the emotions are based on the Minsky's conception of emotions, that consists of four affective dimensions, each one with six levels of activations [1]. Sentiments and emotions are modeled as fuzzy sets; particularly, the intensity of the emotions has been tuned by fuzzy modifiers, which act on the linguistic patterns recognized in the sentences. The approach has been tested on some sets of documents categories, revealing interesting performance on the global framework processing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Group marketing: Theory, mechanisms, and dynamics",Harmeling C.M.; Palmatier R.W.; Fang E.; Wang D.,2017,10.1509/jm.15.0495,"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates.

Obviating some of the theoretical barriers of data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis: An application in predicting cluster membership of customers,Toloo M.; Farzipoor Saen R.; Azadi M.,2015,10.1057/jors.2014.43,"Data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA) has been used for predicting cluster membership of decision-making units (DMUs). One of the possible applications of DEA-DA is in the marketing research area. This paper uses cluster analysis to cluster customers into two clusters: Gold and Lead. Then, to predict cluster membership of new customers, DEA-DA is applied. In DEA-DA, an arbitrary parameter imposing a small gap between two clusters (η) is incorporated. It is shown that different η leads to different prediction accuracy levels since an unsuitable value for η leads to an incorrect classification of DMUs. We show that even the data set with no overlap between two clusters can be misclassified. This paper proposes a new DEA-DA model to tackle this issue.

The influence of the quality in the price of the olive oils in the origin market; [La influencia de la calidad en el precio de los aceites de oliva en origen],Gutiérrez-Salcedo M.; Murgado-Armenteros E.M.; Ruiz F.J.T.,2016,,"Olive oil is a strategic sector in Spanish agriculture, as a main producer country in the world and as a symbolic product for Spanish society (in terms of economy and culture). However, in the last decade olive oil sector is supporting very low commercial margins and it has important problems of profitability. In a context where retail distribution plays an essential role in final price fixing and, therefore, in the total shared amount by all sector agents, the effectiveness of buy-and-sale strategies along the chain influences the commercial results of the different agents. In particular, the main income of olive oil producers comes from oil marketing in the market of origin, which integrates the maximum percentage of dealings (80%). The commercial operations in this market are the references for price negotiations in other levels of the agri-food chain, for example, with distributors. In this scene, Andalusia has a predominant role because it concentrates the Spanish production of olive oils (72,40%). So, the trading operations in this area determine, in part, the national price level and they have a high influence in worldwide prices. Due to its position as a supplier row material, the market of origin is playing a key role in the incomes of all the agents in the chain. For this reason, the study of price formation, its dynamic and the variables that can influence in this process, is needed in order to know the price evolution and therefore, to decide the best moment to buy and sell. In this sense, from our point of view, in the literature is possible to underline two main characteristics that could influence in price's evolution. (1) The prices of different quality levels are very similar Price's differences are small and this fact contrasts with the public strategy to improve the quality of Spanish olive oil production (quality programmes from national and regional government and the European Union). And (2), in the last decade, these differences between qualities are constant and with a similar evolution. So, it could be possible to predict price's evolution only with the price of a quality and adding some cents in order to know the price of the rest. Based on the social context and the development of databases in the market of origin in Andalusia, the objective of this paper is to analyse the casual relationship between the prices of three qualities that are sold in origin: extra virgin, virgin and lampante. The methodology used to study the price evolution and its relationships is based on the cointegration theory, the Error Correction Model and it is completed with the study of short-run relationships through Granger's causality, variance decomposition of forecast errors and impulse response functions. Analysis includes 106 monthly data of each price series for the most instability period in the market of origin (since January'01 to October'09). This information was provided by the Foundation for the Promotion and Development of the Olive Grove and Oil, based on the POOLred System of origin prices. This system collects the features of bulk olive oil transactions of a sample of Andalusian olive oil mills that represents 55.30% of Spanish olive oil production. It is currently the main price reference in this sector. Results show that, in long term, origin is a strong integrated market and it is in equilibrium because the prices of three qualities move together during all the period. However, in short term it is possible to highlight the virgin olive oil as a leader in the market. It is the quality more independent and with more influence over the rest. So, price movements of virgin quality could predict the evolution of the other price's qualities. These outcomes are coherent with the role of virgin quality in the market of origin. Virgin olive oil is the quality with more number of commercial operations in the market. This volume is a consequence of its versatility, because can be used as direct consumption product, to mix with other olive oils or to refine. On the one hand, the direct consumption of virgin quality, similar to the virgin extra olive oil could be an influence in the price of the last one, adopting a role of direct competitor. In this sense, the use of extra virgin as a bait product for distributors reduces the differences between both prices and increase the competency. Furthermore, the consumer's confusion between different qualities of olive oils favours this situation. On the other hand, because a part of virgin's production is used to refne in order to produce olive oil, its prices could be a reference for the price of lampante. At the same time, the strategy of quality implemented by public administration is increasing the volume of virgin and extra virgin olive oils produced in Andalusia and, therefore, the numbers of commercial operations with these qualities in the market of origin. So, when quality production exceeds consumption, a part of these olive oils is destined to elaborate low quality olive oil and it increases price competition. In sum, the large number of operations and its versatility transform the virgin olive oil into the quality more important in the market of origin, from the point of view of price influences. This conclusion is useful to develop managerial strategies, specifically in the forecasting of price behaviour in the market. Because the prediction of price evolution in origin market is affected by several subjective aspects (crop level or weather prevision, for example), the use of an objective predict variable, as a virgin olive oil price, could improve the results of the models. Particularly, these results affect to the study of prices in order to request to government the intervention of the market through private storage system (Spanish Ministry of Agricultural and European Union). Furthermore, in general these results are useful for the development of agri-food policies by sector institutions, which analyse the prices in the market of origin in order to make decision about funding and grant. Finally, this paper could be a starting point to analyse causal relationship between different olive oils in the two main market of the agri-food chain (origin and final market), with the objective to know what variables have to be included in price's forecast models.",Causality; ECM; Olive oils; Price; Quality,Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the pricing dynamics and market behavior of olive oil, which are crucial for long-term strategies in agricultural pricing and market positioning.

The in-kind nature of trade credit is in line with the two-stage lottery method employed in this paper to capture the consequences of default on trade credit effectively. We find that financing capacity encourages the supplier to extend the credit term: a larger market demand rate prompts the supplier to extend a longer credit term, but a higher holding cost for the retailer shortens the length of the credit term received. More risk-averse suppliers tend to grant shorter term, but the impact of risk attitude is insignificant. Empirically, we find evidence supporting our main theoretical predictions by employing a panel sample of manufacturing companies covering 1998–2007 from the COMPUSTAT database. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bilevel programming; Default risk; Economic ordering quantity (EOQ); Trade credit; Two-stage lottery,Springer Verlag,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The paper focuses on decision-making processes around trade credit terms in a structured manner, indicating a tactical approach to optimize outcomes for suppliers and retailers within the constraints of risk and market conditions.",15,60,20,0,5
Networked individuals predict a community wide outcome from their local information,Chesney T.,2014,10.1016/j.dss.2013.07.006,"The term 'viral' is used to describe a phenomenon that tends to be shared by those who encounter it. This paper considers the act of responding positively to a phenomenon by sharing it with others, something exemplified by the online social media acts of choosing to 'like' on Facebook, 'retweet' on Twitter, or by a similar mechanism on websites such as LinkedIn, Flickr or Pinterest. Using a threshold model of influence, simulations are run on four network structures where a critical mass chooses to share a phenomenon that eventually either goes viral or does not. The data collected are examined to determine whether an individual node can make an accurate prediction about the state of the entire network just from information on the behavior of their neighbors. The intention is to study what it is in terms of network structure that makes an individual good at sensing the zeitgeist, or 'spirit of the age'. Findings show that those best placed to predict are 'important' as measured by network centrality, and members of numerous communities. The characteristics of the critical mass are important in determining the spread of a phenomenon and it is possible for an individual node to predict an outcome as well as an observer who has access to the state of every node in the network. Potential applications might be found in monitoring the success of marketing campaigns, or in organizations wishing to keep abreast of current trends in a situation where data on network structure is available but data on the activity of network members is limited. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Consensus decision; Simulation; Social network; Viral marketing,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the prediction of viral phenomena within social networks, which relates to long-term strategic planning in marketing and organizational behavior.

A nonparametric approach to modeling choice with limited data,Farias V.F.; Jagabathula S.; Shah D.,2013,10.1287/mnsc.1120.1610,"Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the ""right"" model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a ""generic"" model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward ""automating"" the crucial task of choice model selection. © 2013 INFORMS.",Choice models; Marketing mix; Nonparametric choice; Preference list; Revenue prediction; Utility preference,,scopus-prediction,Operational,"The abstract discusses a nonparametric approach to choice modeling and revenue predictions, which is closely related to managing day-to-day decisions in marketing operations, such as consumer preferences and choice modeling.",10,20,60,0,10

Brain Whisperers: Cutting through the Clutter with Neuromarketing,Andrejevic M.,2012,10.3366/soma.2012.0057,"The development of the field of neuromarketing piggybacks on growing interest in the neurosciences associated with the development of new brain imaging technology and recent theorizations of the role played by emotion in consumer decision making. Neuromarketers assert that people's bodies are, for marketing purposes, more truthful than the words they utter, promising direct access to formerly concealed aspects of consumer desire. This article situates the promise to bypass the vagaries of discourse with techniques for reading the body within the broader context of a changing information environment and the forms of reflexive awareness of the partial and constructed character of narrative forms of representation. It explores the uptake by neuromarketers of recent theories that posit emotional responses as integral to the process of rational decision making. This uptake repositions marketers as adjuncts to rational deliberation rather than threats to it and the forms of autonomy and citizenship with which it is associated. However, the article argues that neuromarketers’ claims to bypass mediation and the impasses of representation break down upon further examination. In the end, an examination of the recent literature on the topic indicates that neuromarketers – like data miners – are more interested in potentially useful correlations than in underlying explanations. Their portrayal of neuromarketing as a technique for accessing what consumers’ ‘really’ feel amounts to a misreading of their own project, which might be more properly understood as the development of techniques for making probabilistic predictions about the behaviour of populations. © 2012, Edinburgh University Press.

UAV-multispectral and vegetation indices in soybean grain yield prediction based on in situ observation,da Silva E.E.; Rojo Baio F.H.; Ribeiro Teodoro L.P.; da Silva Junior C.A.; Borges R.S.; Teodoro P.E.,2020,10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100318,"Remote sensing techniques using vegetation indices (VI's) have successfully enabled the accurate and timely monitoring of several crops. The purpose of this monitoring is to provide an advantage in terms of on-farm management decision making, crop marketing planning, and support for policy decision-making. We identified here which VI's can be used to predict soybean grain yield (GY) by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and remote multispectral sensor. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in three sites during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons in Brazil. The VI's were measured together with the plant stand assessment at 25 days after emergency (DAE) when the plants were at V4 phenological stage. The processing of the VI models was performed based on the imaging reflectance factor data performed in the field. For statistical data analyses, a correlation network was used to express the relationship between GY and VI's graphically. Path analysis was performed for identifying the cause-and-effect relationship between VI's and GY. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm was generated considering GY as a dependent variable. At last, the relative deviation coefficient was used to illustrate the differences between the VI's in the construction of the decision tree and GY. Our results showed potential for predicting soybean yield based on UAV and the multispectral sensor coupled.

Estimating the importance of consumer purchasing criteria in digital ecosystems,Peláez J.I.; Cabrera F.E.; Vargas L.G.,2018,10.1016/j.knosys.2018.07.023,"The purchasing process consists of multiple, non-isolated phases that describe the interactions between consumers and products. One of these phases is the evaluation of alternatives, in which the consumer compares the benefits that will be obtained from each product or service depending on a set of criteria. Recently, the rise of online ecosystems has fueled the development of new purchasing-decision prediction models (PDPM) based on the shared opinions, concerns, and expectations of customers. Commonly, these PDPMs are constructed as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, where experts ascertain the consumer's purchasing criteria, as well as the importance of them, by means of surveys and their own experience. Although relying on experts may be appropriate for identifying criteria, this approach is not suitable for assessing the importance of said criteria due to the large volume of information available on the Web. Furthermore, the preferences of consumers in online ecosystems evolve constantly. In this regard, we consider that the information about purchase-criteria importance should be derived exclusively from the opinions of consumers. However, the attitude and thought-process leading to purchases contain inherent relationships that consumers are not able to express explicitly; consequently, we explore the possibility to make use of the synergies between criteria along user preferences. This paper proposes a new PDPM that estimates the importance of the criteria and values the alternatives by only considering the opinions expressed by consumers in digital ecosystems, while using an expert-defined set of criteria. The proposed approach extracts the weights of both criteria and alternatives and determines the implicit synergies within them without the need of additional input. Lastly, it uses the Choquet integral for weight and valuation aggregation and determines a purchase ranking. This model has been tested in real examples, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2018",Aggregation operators; Choquet integral; Marketing; Sentiment analysis; Synergy criteria,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a purchasing-decision prediction model (PDPM) that focuses on evaluating alternatives based on consumer opinions and criteria.

The impact of online product reviews on product returns,Sahoo N.; Dellarocas C.; Srinivasan S.,2018,10.1287/isre.2017.0736,"Although many researchers in information systems and marketing have studied the effect of product reviews on sales, few have looked at their effect on product returns. We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.",Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the impact of product reviews on purchase and return behaviors, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing analytics, customer acquisition, and purchase prediction.

Fare prediction websites and transaction prices: Empirical evidence from the airline industry,Mantin B.; Rubin E.,2016,10.1287/mksc.2015.0965,"The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%–6% in transactions’ prices.

This was done for a database, obtained from a large Korean mobile telephone service provider, of 533 customer calls to call centers in 2009. After eliminating calls not containing customer complaints or comments, the remaining 383 comments were classified by an expert panel into four domains and 27 complaint categories. The four domains were Transaction-related (189 comments, 49%), Product-related (120 comments, 31%), Customer Service or Support-related (38 comments, 10%) and Customer Outreach and Marketing-related (36 comments, 9%). The comments were then randomly assigned to either a training set (257 cases, 67%) or test set (126 cases, 33%). The training set was used to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier that correctly predicted the domain 75% of the time and the specific subcategory 51% of the time for the test set. Prediction accuracy was strongly related to prediction strength for both sets of predictions, suggesting that simple filtering strategies where difficult to understand comments are flagged for expert review and easy comments are automatically classified are both technically feasible and likely to be practically valuable.

The Influence of B to B Social Media Message Features on Brand Engagement: A Fluency Perspective,McShane L.; Pancer E.; Poole M.,2019,10.1080/1051712X.2019.1565132,"Purpose: Social media is increasingly drawing the attention and interest of business-to-business (B to B) organizations. Yet, B to B organizations remain cautious in their social media pursuits, in part based on a stated lack of understanding for best practices. The purpose of the current work is to take initial steps to address this challenge by identifying specific social media message features that influence online users’ engagement with B to B organizations. Methodology/Approach: This work examines the Twitter feeds of the top 50 social B to B brands (as reported by Brandwatch in 2015) to examine the effects of message features (hashtags, text difficulty, embedded media, and message timing) on user engagement, captured in terms of Twitter likes and retweets. Findings: We argue that message features that enhance fluency (e.g., images) should enhance engagement. In contrast, those that disrupt fluency (e.g., hasthags) should result in lower levels of engagement. Consistent with these predictions, we find that hashtags and text difficulty correlate to lower levels of engagement whereas embedded media in the form of images and video correlate to higher levels of engagement. Also consistent with the proposed fluency framework, we find that tweets from B to B organizations generate greater engagement on evenings and weekends. Research Implications: This research applies a fluency lens to identify specific message features that influence online engagement. In doing so, it highlights fluency as a powerful construct for understanding the drivers of B to B social media brand engagement. More generally, this work suggests fluency as a valuable conceptual lens for developing effective B to B social media strategies. This research also speaks to the complexity of B to B social media strategies–organizations must go beyond content and platform decisions, to also consider the specific features of the message. Practical Implications: Social media is becoming more and more important to B to B organizations and is as yet an underutilized engagement tool. The current work offers initial strategies regarding message features that business practitioners can incorporate into their content development strategies to strengthen engagement. Specifically, efforts should be made to attain high levels of fluency in B to B social media content development.

Managerial empathy facilitates egocentric predictions of consumer preferences,Hattula J.D.; Herzog W.; Dahl D.W.; Reinecke S.,2015,10.1509/jmr.13.0296,"Common wisdom suggests that managerial empathy (i.e., the mental process of taking a consumer perspective) helps executives separate their personal consumption preferences from those of consumers, thereby preventing egocentric preference predictions. The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers' self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers' private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathie managers' self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions, the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity endorsement. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",Consumer preference predictions; Managerial decision making; Managerial empathy; Managers' consumer identity; Responsiveness to market research,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses managerial empathy and its effects on decision-making processes in marketing contexts such as product development and pricing.

Allocation with traffic spikes: Mixing adversarial and stochastic models,Esfandiari H.; Korula N.; Mirrokni V.,2018,10.1145/3105446,"Motivated by Internet advertising applications, online allocation problems have been studied extensively in various adversarial and stochastic models. While the adversarial arrival models are too pessimistic, many of the stochastic (such as i.i.d. or random-order) arrival models do not realistically capture uncertainty in predictions. A significant cause for such uncertainty is the presence of unpredictable traffic spikes, often due to breaking news or similar events. To address this issue, a simultaneous approximation framework has been proposed to develop algorithms that work well both in the adversarial and stochastic models; however, this framework does not enable algorithms that make good use of partially accurate forecasts when making online decisions. In this article, we propose a robust online stochastic model that captures the nature of traffic spikes in online advertising. In our model, in addition to the stochastic input for which we have good forecasting, an unknown number of impressions arrive that are adversarially chosen. We design algorithms that combine a stochastic algorithm with an online algorithm that adaptively reacts to inaccurate predictions. We provide provable bounds for our new algorithms in this framework. We accompany our positive results with a set of hardness results showing that our algorithms are not far from optimal in this framework. As a byproduct of our results, we also present improved online algorithms for a slight variant of the simultaneous approximation framework. Copyright © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Technology-enabled community data for gaining pre-release brand insights,Ponnamma Divakaran P.K.,2018,10.1016/j.techfore.2017.09.024,"In the past, studies have investigated brand equity only in the ‘post-launch’ context, hence missing opportunities to make early corrections in cases of negative favourability. Using technology-enabled online community data, this study examines whether ‘pre-launch’ brand favourability can predict community's post-launch purchase decisions, by introducing a new construct called community-based brand equity (CoBBE). This study also investigates whether CoBBE can predict future sales of new products. Weekly data are collected for eight weeks before and after product launch from a movie-based online community for a period of 16 months.

Good and guilt-free: The role of self-accountability in influencing preferences for products with ethical attributes,Peloza J.; White K.; Shang J.,2013,10.1509/jm.11.0454,"The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management.

"Experience, socialization and customer retention: Lessons from the dance floor",Giudicati G.; Riccaboni M.; Romiti A.,2013,10.1007/s11002-013-9233-6,"Experience and socialization are key factors in customer commitment and defection decisions. To study the effect of experience and social relationships on customer retention, we analyze a reality-mined co-presence network of health club members over a period of 4 years. Since central customers in the network have more social ties they will lose if they defect, we use centrality as a proxy for customer relationship switching costs. We find that long-standing customers do have a lower chance of renewing their contracts. However, in line with theoretical predictions (Burnham et al., Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 31(2):109-126, 2003), the consumer's centrality in the network (reflecting a social cost of defection) reduces customer churn rate.

Comparative analysis and short term sales forecasting for an Ethiopian shoe manufacturing company,Gebre T.W.; Singh R.,2016,10.17010/ijom/2016/v46/i10/102853,"Forecasts are a basic input in the decision processes of operations management because they provide information on future demand and to increase revenue. The main purpose of this paper was to compare three different quantitative forecasting methods and develop a monthly short term sales forecasting model specifically on shoes of A-Shoe Company, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Twelve months (December 2013 - November 2014) sales data (of different types of pair of shoes) was collected from the company. From quantitative forecasting methods, a time-series model, that is, moving average, weighted moving average, and exponential smoothing were used to predict monthly sales forecast for the month of December 2014. Trend equation was formulated by using the least square regression method; analysis was done along with standard error of estimate. Prediction interval limits at 95% level of confidence were calculated. Exponential smoothing forecasting method (with alpha value 0.1) was found to be fit when comparing different mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE). The forecasted shoe sales value was found to be within the prediction interval limits. ANOVA results revealed that the calculated value of F (9.34) was less than the table value of F (10.04). Hence, the null hypothesis (b = 0) is accepted.

Segmenting consumers purchase intention towards Edible bird's nest products using the decision tree techniques,Shukri N.N.H.M.; Nawi N.M.; Abdullah A.M.; Man N.,2019,,"Domestic consumption of nutritional products and food supplements are on the rise. This is due to the fact that consumers have become more affluent and aware of their health. Edible bird's nest (EBN) is used as a health supplement for medicinal benefits to improve health quality. However, issues such as contamination and counterfeit EBN have caused fluctuation of the product's price over time and consumers are slowly shunning away from consuming EBN products. Marketing effort is a strategy tool often used to convince buying intention among consumers and therefore relieve the public's anxiety. Presently, the extent of marketing mix that can convince consumers' intention to purchase EBN products remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the influence of marketing mix towards consumers' intention to purchase EBN products. Principle component analysis and decision tree models were used to analyze the data. The performance of three decision tree models was compared based on accuracy and sensitivity rate. Result showed that all three models possessed similar accuracy rate (CART = 84.35%, C5.0 = 84.73%, QUEST = 83.08%), while C5.0 had the highest sensitivity (CART = 84.7%, C5.0 = 87.46%, QUEST = 85.59%).

Consumer attitude metrics for guiding marketing mix decisions,Hanssens D.M.; Pauwels K.H.; Srinivasan S.; Vanhuele M.; Yildirim G.,2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0841,"Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions, attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance, often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and we validate them in a holdout sample.

What Happens When Manufacturers Perform The Retailing Functions?,Li J.; Chan T.Y.; Lewis M.,2016,10.1111/poms.12549,"This study examines the effects of a relatively new channel structure on prices and sales in a large department store, which in recent years has switched the management of many of its product categories from a traditional retailer-managed system to a manufacturer-managed system. We find that the change caused overall retail prices to decrease. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the response across brands. In the cell phone category, brands with high market shares and inelastic demand did not change prices. In the watch category, the retail prices of relatively low-end brands decreased while the prices of premium brands increased substantially after the switch. In addition to sales increases due to lower prices, we find that the channel structure change further caused sales to increase by 9–10% in the cell phone category and by 11–17% in the watch category.

Estimating Network Effects in Two-Sided Markets,Hinz O.; Otter T.; Skiera B.,2020,10.1080/07421222.2019.1705509,"The proliferation of the Internet has enabled platform intermediaries to create two-sided markets in many industries. Time-series data on the number of customers on both sides of the markets allow platform intermediaries for estimating the direction and magnitude of network effects, which can then support growth predictions and subsequent information technology (IT) or marketing investment decisions. This article investigates the conditions under which this estimation of same-side and cross-side network effects should distinguish between its impact on the number of new customers (i.e., acquisition) and existing customers (i.e., their activity). The authors propose an influx-outflow model for doing so and conduct a simulation study to benchmark the new model against the traditional model. Further they compare the models in an illustrative empirical study in which they study the growth of an Internet auction platform. The results show that this separation of effects is beneficial because the existing customers on both sides of the market can influence the acquisition and dropout of other customers asymmetrically.

Customer churns prediction in telecom using adaptive logitboost learning approach,Hemalatha M.; Mahalakshmi S.,2020,,"In telecom sector, huge amount of data is generated on daily routine owing to extensive client base. Business analysts and decision makers highlighted that including new customers seems to be costly than that of maintaining prevailing customers. Customer relationship management (CRM) and Business analysts have to recognize the cause of churn customers and to validate behavioural patterns from prevailing churn customer‘s data. This work anticipated a churn prediction model that utilizes clustering and classification approaches to recognize churn customers and to give factors that resides behind customer churning in telecom sectors. Feature selection is carried out with association attribute ranking model and weighted oversampling technique. The proposed approach initially classifies churn customers data with Adaptive Logitboost (ALB) classification algorithm for classifying the instance more appropriately. Generation of retention policies is a significant process of relationship management to eliminate churners. After performing classification approach, these model segments customers‘ data by categorization using requirement similarity matrix to acquire information gain. This model validates churn factors that are needed for determining primary cause of churn. By recognizing essential churn factors from customer data, CRM may enhance productivity by recommending appropriate promotions to set of customers based on association among behavioural patterns. Thereby, marketing campaigns are improved for the company. The anticipated churn prediction model is computed with metrics like precision, accuracy, F-measure, recall and receiving operating characteristics (ROC) area.

Personal relevance and mental simulation amplify the duration framing effect,Ülkümen G.; Thomas M.,2013,10.1509/jmr.10.0172,"Different framing of the same duration (one year, 12 months, 365 days) can influence consumers' impressions of subjective duration, thereby affecting their judgments and decisions. The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Duration framing; Duration perception; Mental simulation; Personal relevance; Process simulation,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses how different framings of time can influence consumer behavior and decision-making, which aligns with tactical marketing efforts that focus on optimizing consumer engagement and decision processes.",10,70,15,0,5

Detect potential relations by link prediction in multi-relational social networks,Chen L.; Gao M.; Li B.; Liu W.; Chen B.,2018,10.1016/j.dss.2018.09.006,"Potential relation detecting on social network has become more important for decision making in many business disciplines, such as marketing, business strategy, human resources development, finance planning, business transformation, insurance policy design, and tourism management. People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for “word of mouth” advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks.

The bias bias,Brighton H.; Gigerenzer G.,2015,10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.01.061,"In marketing and finance, surprisingly simple models sometimes predict more accurately than more complex, sophisticated models. Here, we address the question of when and why simple models succeed - or fail - by framing the forecasting problem in terms of the bias-variance dilemma. Controllable error in forecasting consists of two components, the ""bias"" and the ""variance"". We argue that the benefits of simplicity are often overlooked because of a pervasive ""bias bias"": the importance of the bias component of prediction error is inflated, and the variance component of prediction error, which reflects an oversensitivity of a model to different samples from the same population, is neglected. Using the study of cognitive heuristics, we discuss how to reduce variance by ignoring weights, attributes, and dependencies between attributes, and thus make better decisions. Bias and variance, we argue, offer a more insightful perspective on the benefits of simplicity than Occam''s razor. © 2015 .",Bias bias; Bias-variance dilemma; Occam's razor; Out-of-sample prediction; Simple heuristics; Uncertainty,Elsevier Inc.,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the bias-variance dilemma in forecasting and the benefits of simplicity in predictive models, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and decision-making in marketing and finance.",60,20,10,5,5
Environmental considerations in the purchase decisions of Ghanaian consumers,Opoku R.; Famiyeh S.; Kwarteng A.,2020,10.1108/SRJ-11-2016-0206,"Purpose: By relying on the Theory of Planned Behavior, this paper aims to understand the relative importance of attitude, subjective norm (SN), behavioral control, self-identity (SI) and past behavior in the prediction of green purchase behavior among Ghanaian consumers. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 306 graduate students were surveyed on the environmental considerations in their purchase behavior using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Findings: The results of the study indicate that, in general, attitude and SI are more important than SN in influencing green purchase intention in a collectivistic country, such as Ghana. Yet, most respondents were neutral in their responses to questions as to whether they are green consumers and/or if they consider themselves to be concerned about environmental issues.

(De)marketing to manage consumer quality inferences,Miklós-Thal J.; Zhang J.,2013,10.1509/jmr.11.0432,"Savvy consumers attribute a product's market performance to its intrinsic quality as well as the seller's marketing push. The authors study how sellers should optimize their marketing decisions in response. They find that a seller can benefit from ""demarketing"" its product, meaning visibly toning down its marketing efforts. Demarketing lowers expected sales ex ante but improves product quality image ex post, as consumers attribute good sales to superior quality and lackluster sales to insufficient marketing.

Revisiting optimal cutoff score determination in direct marketing using BLINEX loss: Bayesian decisive prediction approach,Levy M.S.; Wen D.; Chakilam V.; Wang H.-Y.,2016,10.1080/01966324.2016.1173607,"We develop a method to predict an optimal cutoff point from an ascending list of potential customer activation scores tomaximize profit in a future direct marketing campaign. The scoring model is based upon attributes available froma database. Our Bayesian predictive decision theoretic solution is based on two features: (1) a three-parameter bounded, asymmetric loss function BLINEX that has a higher penalty for failure to choose good prospects rather than including too many bad prospects; and (2) a Bayesian nonstandard t-predictive distribution for a future optimal score derived from normal-gamma likelihood function with unknown mean and variance based on data consisting of past optimal activation scores together with a four-parameter conjugate prior. The parameters of the BLINEX loss are also derived from past data. A comparison of BLINEX derived profits with those fromtraditional squared error loss is made via a fractional factorial experimental design with a half-normal analysis.

Signaling effects and the role of culture: movies in international auxiliary channels,Sinha A.; Gu H.; Kim N.; Emile R.,2019,10.1108/EJM-09-2017-0587,"Purpose: Given the high uncertainty in the quality perception of experiential products, manufacturers use signals to influence consumers’ decisions. In the movie industry, literature shows that performance of the main channel (e.g. cinema) strongly influences the performance of auxiliary channels (e.g. DVDs). The success of a movie in the home country is also to be resonated by its good performance in host countries. However, the cultural contingency of these success-breeds-success (SBS) effects has not been examined. This paper aims to test the influence of cultural values on the SBS effects across channels and countries. Design/methodology/approach: Borrowing concepts from the signaling literature and analyzing DVD sales data from six international markets using a multilevel mixed-effects model, the study finds that culture plays a significant role to influence both SBS effects. Findings: In countries with low power distance, short-term orientation and high indulgence, consumers who purchase from auxiliary channels are more likely to be influenced by the box office performance of movies. Meanwhile, cultural distance between the home and host nations significantly decreases the cross-national SBS effect. Research limitations/implications: The findings are likely to be generalized to online auxiliary channels of movies, but empirical testing is required to ensure that no major adaptation is required in the process. Future research can also extend the framework of this paper to include more countries into the analysis and investigate cultural variables beyond Hofstede’s dimensions. Practical implications: This paper suggests that the SBS effects may vary across nations. When managers plan for the sequential distributions of experiential products, the cultural values of target markets should be considered to decrease the uncertainty in sales prediction. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the international auxiliary channels of movies and incorporating cultural values into the framework of sequential distributions.

Predicting adoption probabilities in social networks,Fang X.; Hu P.J.; Li Z.L.; Tsai W.,2013,10.1287/isre.1120.0461,"In a social network, adoption probability refers to the probability that a social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Naïve Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer limited predictive power and that confounding factors are critical to adoption probability predictions. © 2013 INFORMS.",Adoption probability; Bayesian learning; Confounding factor; Entity similarity; Social influence; Social network; Structural equivalence,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses predicting adoption probabilities based on various factors which aligns well with tactical decision-making in marketing, such as advanced targeting and marketing analytics.",10,70,15,0,5
EEG frontal asymmetry predicts product purchase differently for national brands and private labels.,Garczarek-Bak U.; Disterheft A.,2018,10.1037/npe0000094,"The results of the following study show that among various neurophysiological measures, only the frontal asymmetry index measured with electroencephalography was significant in predicting further purchase decisions.

A primer to the general theory of behavioral strategies in business-to-business marketing,Woodside A.G.,2014,10.1108/S1069-096420140000021012,"The general theory of behavioral strategies includes a set of propositions supporting alternative configurations of objectives, contextual features, and beliefs/assessments by executives. The theory includes the outcomes of selections of specific decision alternatives. Building behavioral-strategy models in contexts enriches one or more goals of science and practice: description, understanding, prediction, and influence/control. This chapter is a primer to the general theory. A brief review of relevant empirical studies supports the general theory. The empirical studies include the use of alternative data collection and analytically tools including true field experiments, think aloud methods, long interviews, statistical hypothesis testing, ethnographic decision tree modeling, and building and testing algorithms (e.g., qualitative comparative analysis, QCA). The general theory is the blending of cognitive science, economics, marketing, psychology, and implemented practices in explicit contexts. Consequently, behavioral-strategy theory is distinct from context-free microeconomics, market-driven, and competitor-only decision-making.

Aras Design and Multimedia Centre (ADMC): it’s pricing strategy for video internet market training,Basiruddin R.; Tobi S.U.M.; Quoquab F.,2016,10.1108/EEMCS-01-2016-0003,"Subject area: Managerial Accounting, Strategic Marketing. More specifically, cost behavior, cost estimation, cost prediction, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, contribution income statement and pricing/promotional strategy. Study level/applicability: This case is suitable to be used in advanced undergraduate level. Case overview: This case demonstrates the issues relating to pricing strategy of “Video Internet Marketing Training”. Diyana Tahir and her husband, Abdul Rahim Abdul Shukor, established Aras Design & Multimedia Centre (ADMC) on January 17, 2009. The main office was located at Kuala Lumpur. Diyana was a well-known name in the field of internet video marketing training. In its early years, ADMC’s operation was limited to providing printing and graphic design services and offering printing materials for photocopy. However, with the passage of time, the company began to expand its services and offerings. At the beginning of 2010, ADMC offered editing facilities and services for video and multimedia in addition to its core services. As a unique marketing strategy, Diyana offered RM30 as the basic training fee for each participant, which was equivalent to RM470 value offered. In this way, she attracted customers to take part in further advanced level training that was conducted by ADMC. However, she felt that the number of participant to take advanced training was not satisfactory. She thought that it happened perhaps due to the fact that the participants were not much committed to the course since it was offered at a nominal price. Furthermore, she realized that the cost of providing such training had risen in the past six months. Currently, ADMC suffered losses in three consecutive months, and they really needed enough cash to sustain. As such, Diyana was thinking to reconsider the offered course fees whether to increase it. She was in a rush to make a decision to propose the new course fee in the monthly meeting with management committee at the end of April 2013. Expected learning outcomes: Using this case, students can learn how a small-scale company can strategize its pricing strategy to survive in the highly competitive online market. The objectives of using this case are as follows: to help students in understanding the interrelationships between CVP in organization that can be used for future planning and decision-making; to be able to identify the cost structure of the basic training course (e.g. fixed and variable costs), determine the contribution margin, break-even point and prepare the contribution income statement that highlighting cost behavior; to help students to think critically while setting the price for the offered services; to develop students’ ability in analyzing the existing situation to come up with a viable and effective solution; to assist students in taking the right move in a right time; to broaden students’ views and understanding in considering the monetary aspect along with the human aspect in formulating an effective marketing strategy; to develop students’ understanding of the way to retain and attract customers through innovative pricing strategy; and to make students aware that innovation is the key to business success.

Predictive validity of evidence-based persuasion principles: An application of the index method,Armstrong J.S.; Du R.; Green K.C.; Graefe A.,2016,10.1108/EJM-10-2015-0728,"Purpose – This paper aims to test whether a structured application of persuasion principles might help improve advertising decisions. Evidence-based principles are currently used to improve decisions in other complex situations, such as those faced in engineering and medicine. Design/methodology/approach – Scores were calculated from the ratings of 17 self-trained novices who rated 96 matched pairs of print advertisements for adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles. Predictions from traditional methods – 10,809 unaided judgments from novices and 2,764 judgments from people with some expertise in advertising and 288 copy-testing predictions – provided benchmarks. Findings – A higher adherence-to-principles-score correctly predicted the more effective advertisement for 75 per cent of the pairs. Copy testing was correct for 59 per cent, and expert judgment was correct for 55 per cent. Guessing would provide 50 per cent accurate predictions. Combining judgmental predictions led to substantial improvements in accuracy. Research limitations/implications – Advertisements for high-involvement utilitarian products were tested on the assumption that persuasion principles would be more effective for such products. The measure of effectiveness that was available –day-after-recall – is a proxy for persuasion or behavioral measures. Practical/implications – Pretesting advertisements by assessing adherence to evidence-based persuasion principles in a structured way helps in deciding which advertisements would be best to run. That procedure also identifies how to make an advertisement more effective.

Language symmetry: A force behind persuasion,Yeager J.; Sommer L.,2012,,"Language operates according to rules. Rules mean prediction. The application of these language rules to persuasive campaigns through linguistic technology can result in major gains in advertising, political and marketing outcomes. For qualitative researchers in communications, marketing and messaging, one area of persuasive language technology can be found in the linguistic feature of symmetry. Language has many forms of symmetry, and most persuaders are unaware that a great deal of persuasion depends upon symmetrical message structures. In persuasion, a mirror image or symmetrical reflection of an attitude or opinion is more persuasive than a random or non-symmetrical message or idea. Reading the subtle features of language to create symmetrical responses can create extraordinarily successful results for research and applied persuasive efforts ranging from single interviews to mass marketing campaigns. © 2012: Joseph Yeager, Linda Sommer, and Nova Southeastern University.",Decision prototyping; Linguistic research; Linguistic symmetry; Motivation and decision grammar; Persuasive communications; Predictive motivational profiling; Qualitative research,Peace and Conflict Studies,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the application of linguistic technology to create persuasive messaging, which aligns with tactical marketing efforts aimed at optimizing campaigns and improving outcomes through specific strategies such as symmetry in language.",15,60,20,0,5

A 2020 perspective on “Online ad effectiveness evaluation with a two-stage method using a Gaussian filter and decision tree approach”,Wang H.; Hong M.,2020,10.1016/j.elerap.2020.100928,"Online ads create opportunities for advisers to discover potential customers by delivering marketing massages through the Internet. Effectiveness evaluation of online ads is useful so they can save unnecessary costs and increase their profitability. The task of early removal of ineffective online ads is a key aspect of effectiveness evaluation. Few studies have focused on early removal of ineffective online ads though. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage method based on a Gaussian filter and a decision tree (M-GFDT). Our method uses a Gaussian filter to adjust distribution of business data in the first stage and builds a decision tree classifier to remove ineffective online ads and at the same time achieve high accuracy for predicting effective online ads. The second stage involves validation of our method experimentally, with data from a cross-border e-commerce firm. The research evaluation results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting effective online ads. It also aids in the removal of ineffective online ads as early as possible.

The role of situational factor on buyer characteristics and purchase decision among Malaysian low-cost airline travellers,Kalaiarasan K.; Govindan S.; Nasaratnam S.,2018,,"Buyer characteristics are a set of psychological, social, personal, and cultural factors which influence purchase decisions. Buyer characteristics lead to the purchase of a product or service, which impacts organization profit maximization and sustainability. Therefore, organizations emphasize building strong relationship with buyers. This has become a marketing priority in the current marketing environment.

However, the low-cost airline industry is facing purchase decision issues on domestic traveller aspect. Thus, the objective of this research is to investigate the significant relationship between buyer characteristics and purchase decision and to examine whether situational factors act to strengthen purchase decisions.

David vs. Goliath: An analysis of asymmetric mixed-strategy games and experimental evidence,Amaldoss W.; Jain S.,2002,10.1287/mnsc.48.8.972.165,"Mixed strategies are widely used to model strategic situations in diverse fields such as economics, marketing, political science, and biology. However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects.

Two different surveys administered to individual investors examine the psychological and sociological drivers of dispositional innovativeness and its effects on adoption timing and range of adoption for five new investment products. Study 1 shows that consumer psychographics (e.g., market mavenism, product-category involvement, and ambiguity intolerance) rather than socio-demographics (e.g., age, education, and risk profile) explain dispositional innovativeness and that dispositional innovativeness strongly impacts time of adoption and ownership of new investment products. Study 2 cross-validates the results of Study 1 and investigates the indirect effects of dispositional innovativeness on adoption timing through consumers' perceptions of new investment products' complexity, riskiness, and visibility (exposure to and engagement in word-of-mouth). Individuals who score high on dispositional innovativeness adopt new investment products quickly because they perceive lower complexity and greater visibility, not because they perceive lower risk.

Productive play time: The effect of practice on consumer demand for hedonic experiences,Murray K.B.; Bellman S.,2011,10.1007/s11747-010-0205-6,"In this paper we explain how practice, prior knowledge and task difficulty interact to affect demand for hedonic experiences. As predicted by the human capital model, we propose that the key determinant of demand for hedonic experiences is the increase in performance efficiency that can be gained through practice. In addition, we argue that the nature of the effect of practice is distinctly different in hedonic consumption, compared to utilitarian consumption. Specifically, for hedonic experiences, practice allows consumers to extract greater value within a given period of time, rather than reduce the amount of time spent on a (utilitarian) task. Finally, we argue that if changes in performance efficiency across repeated hedonic experiences adhere to the power law of practice, then both prior knowledge and task difficulty will be important moderators of the main effect of practice on demand.

Design/methodology/approachThe research adopted the method of structured content analysis and carried out the survey in Chinese home appliance industry, mainly covering the largest firms, including TCL, Hisense, Changhong, Konka, Haier, and Skyworth. The method of multiple regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. FindingsThe results show that in order to comprehensively forecast competitor's responding behaviors, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market. Additionally, in the process of dynamic interaction, the attacking or responding action is not independent and it is related significantly to another three type decisions, which are market and non-market, strategic and tactic, and collective and individual. Further, the study asserts that, in market field, tactic activity is more likely to trigger competitor's response than strategic one, while in non-market, the situation is just the opposite. Meanwhile, the study figured out that individual market attack is easier to trigger individual market and non-market response, as well as collective market response. While for non-market action, whatever it is individual or collective, both would be easy to provoke competitor's collective response. Originality/valueThe research findings extend the existing competitive interaction theory to non-market field. When forecasting competitor's choice of the competitive action, the firms could not only limit their perspective to market field but also pay attention to non-market, attaching importance to certain situation of competitor's taking such non-market action as corporate philanthropy, etc. to launch an attack or a response for gaining competitive advantage. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",China; Competitive advantage; Marketing strategy,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the development of a four-stage decision-making model for predicting competitive response, which focuses on long-term strategic planning and understanding competitors' strategic choices in both market and non-market contexts.

Predicting consumer decisions to adopt mobile commerce: Cross country empirical examination between China and Malaysia,Chong A.Y.-L.; Chan F.T.S.; Ooi K.-B.,2012,10.1016/j.dss.2011.12.001,"Advancements in wireless communications have increased the number of people using mobile devices, and have accelerated the growth of mobile commerce (m-commerce). This study aims to investigate the factors that predict consumer intention to adopt m-commerce in Malaysia and China. The work extends the traditional technology acceptance model (TAM) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) model, and includes additional variables such as trust, cost, social influence, variety of services, and control variables such as age, educational level, and gender of consumers. By comparing consumers from both Malaysia and China, this research is able to form a prediction model based on two different cultural settings. Data was collected from 172 Malaysian consumers and 222 Chinese consumers, and hierarchical regression analysis was employed to test the research model. The results showed that age, trust, cost, social influence, and variety of services are able to predict Malaysian consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. Trust, cost, and social influence can be used to predict Chinese consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce.

Is that deal worth my time? The interactive effect of relative and referent thinking on willingness to seek a bargain,Saini R.; Rao R.S.; Monga A.,2010,10.1509/jmkg.74.1.34,"Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme.

Incorporating context effects into a choice model,Rooderkerk R.P.; Van Heerde H.J.; Bijmolt T.H.A.,2011,10.1509/jmkr.48.4.767,"The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a contextfree partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Behavioral decision making; Choice models; Context effects; Hierarchical bayes; Product line design,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction,Operational,"The abstract discusses a discrete-choice model that decomposes product utility into context-free and context-dependent components, which is directly related to managing consumer preferences and choice modeling.

A mathematical programming model for market share prediction,Oral M.; Kettani O.,1989,10.1016/0169-2070(89)90064-2,"The primary objective of the multiattribute models in the area of marketing is to discover the way the consumers make their choice among available alternative products. Discovering the process of choice of the customers serves as a basis for many marketing decisions such as new product planning, advertising message selection, product positioning, pricing, concept testing, sales forecasting, benefit segmentation, personal selling strategy formulation, etc. The multiattribute models proposed for this purpose can be grouped into two classes: (i) models based on mathematical programming techniques, and (ii) models based on statistical techniques. The recent literature surveys indicate that the results obtained from linear programming models show greater stability and better predictive ability. In this study therefore we will concentrate only on the mathematical programming methods of estimation in general and on a new market share prediction model in particular. The main feature of the proposed model is that it recognizes the dependence of attribute weights on attribute scores through a step function.

Asymmetric promotion effects and brand positioning,Bronnenberg B.J.; Wathieu L.,1996,10.1287/mksc.15.4.379,"Several studies have shown that promotions of national brands yield more effect than those of store brands; (e.g, Allenby and Rossi 1991, Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989). However the evolution of price-quality data available from Consumer Reports over the last 15 years seems to reveal a reduction of the quality gap between store brands and national brands, while price differences remain substantial. Simultaneously, the share of private label brands has increased (Progressive Grocer 1994). In this context, we study whether we can maintain a view of the world where national brands may easily attract consumers from store brands through promotions, whereas store brands are relatively ineffective in attracting consumers from national brands by such means. We analyze consumer reactions to price discounts in a parsimonious preference model featuring loss aversion and reference-dependence along dimensions of price and quality (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993, Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The key result of our analysis is that, given any two brands, there is an asymmetric promotion effect in favor of the higher quality /higher price brands if and only if the quality gap between the brands is sufficiently large in comparison with the price gap. Thus, the direction of promotion asymmetry is not unconditional. It depends uniquely on the value of the ratio of quality and price differences compared to a category specific criterion, which we call Φ. If the ratio of quality and price differences is larger than this criterion, the usual asymmetry prevails; if such is not the case, the lower quality/ lower price brands promote more effectively. More precisely, our model predicts that cross promotion effects depend on two components of brand positioning in the price/quality quadrant. First, we define a variable termed ""positioning advantage"" that indicates whether, relative to the standards achieved by another brand, a given brand is under-priced (positive advantage) or overpriced (negative advantage). Promotion effectiveness is increasing in this variable. Second, cross promotion effects between two brands depend on their distance in the price/quality quadrant. This variable impacts promotion effectiveness negatively and symmetrically for any pair of brands. ""Positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance"" are orthogonal components of brand positioning, irrespective of the degree of correlation between available price and quality levels in the market. Empirically, we investigate the role of brand positioning in explaining cross promotion effects using panel data from the chilled orange juice and peanut butter categories. We compute the independent positioning variables, ""positioning advantage"" and ""brand distance,"" from readily available data on price and quality positioning after obtaining our estimates of Φ. We next measure promotion effectiveness by estimating choice share changes in response to a price discount, using a choice model that does not contain any information about quality/price ratios. Finally, we test the relation between the two positioning variables and the promotion effectiveness measures. The data reveal that in the orange juice category lower quality/lower price brands generally promote more effectively than higher quality/higher price brands. In the peanut butter data the opposite asymmetry holds. In both cases, inter-brand promotion patterns are well explained by the positioning variables. An attractive feature of our model is that, in addition to the direction of promotion asymmetries, it also explains the extent of those asymmetries. A further interesting aspect of this approach is that we go beyond a categorization of brands into price tiers. For instance, lower tier brands in our data may promote more effectively than one national brand but less effectively than another. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the data presented here seem to confirm that such cases occur because the lower tier brand offers a favorable trade-off of price and quality differences compared with one national brand and a less favorable trade-off compared with the other. The content of this paper is potentially relevant for brand managers or retailers concerned with predicting the impact of their promotions. The paper is of particular interest to marketing scientists who study the performance of store brands versus national brands and may also appeal to those who wish to explore the marketing implications of behavioral decision theory. Finally, our investigation does not reject Blattberg and Wisniewski's (1989) finding, shared by Allenby and Rossi (1991) and Hardie, Johnson, and Fader (1993), that national brands have a principle advantage in promotion effectiveness. Rather, it formalizes when this principle advantage is overruled by positioning disadvantages of such brands.",Brand choice; Brand positioning; Loss aversion; Promotion; Reference-dependence,Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses specific marketing strategies related to promotions and consumer behavior, indicating a focus on implementing and optimizing those strategies effectively.

Linking marketing and engineering product design decisions via analytical target cascading,Michalek J.J.; Feinberg F.M.; Papalambros P.Y.,2005,10.1111/j.0737-6782.2005.00102.x,"Firms design products that appeal to consumers and are feasible to produce. The resulting marketing and engineering design goals are driven by consumer preferences and engineering capabilities, two issues that conveniently are addressed in isolation from one another. This convenient isolation, however, typically will not result in optimal product decisions when the two problems are interrelated. A method new to the marketing community, analytical target cascading (ATC), is adopted here to explore such interrelationships and to formalize the process of coordinating marketing and engineering design problems in a way that is proven to yield the joint optimal solution. The ATC model is built atop well-established marketing methodologies, such as conjoint, discrete choice modeling and demand forecasting. The method is demonstrated in the design of dial-readout household scales, using real conjoint choice data and a parametric engineering product design model. Results indicate that the most profitable achievable product can fall short of predictions based on marketing alone but well ahead of what engineering may produce based on original marketing target specifications.

Anticipating a regrettable purchase: Implications of erroneous affective forecasting for marketing planning,Sevdalis N.; Kokkinaki F.; Harvey N.,2008,10.1108/02634500810879287,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of consumers' erroneous affective self-forecasts, and discuss the implications of such forecasts for consumer purchasing behaviour and marketing planning. Design/methodology/approach - First, the literature on inaction inertia - the lowering of the likelihood that a bargain will be taken once a better bargain has been missed - is reviewed. Second, the literature on affective self-forecasting is reviewed. Finally, the implications that the authors synthesis of the behavioural evidence carries for marketing are discussed. Findings - The in action inertia literature implicates the regret that consumers associate with purchasing a discounted item once they have missed a much larger discount on it as a major contributing factor to consumers' unwillingness to purchase the item on the second occasion. The literature on affective self-prediction suggests that regret (and other emotions) is systematically mispredicted. Research limitations/implications - The likely effect of erroneously anticipated regret in inaction inertia situations is depressed purchasing behaviour. The paper argues that because affective anticipations are typically erroneous, their impact on consumer decision-making processes cannot be deemed rational. It is proposed that marketing should intervene to either increase the accuracy of such anticipations, or to lead consumers to discount them. Practical implications - Price promotions can have negative side effects, such as those observed in inaction inertia circumstances. To some extent, these are driven by consumers anticipated regret (and possibly other relevant emotions). Marketing techniques can counteract the disproportionate impact of such emotions.

"Instant customer base analysis: Managerial heuristics often ""get it right""",Wübben M.; Wangenheim F.V.,2008,10.1509/jmkg.72.3.82,"Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care.

Competitive pricing of information: A longitudinal experiment,Christen M.; Sarvary M.,2007,10.1509/jmkr.44.1.42,"Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition between independent information sellers can result in prices that are negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers. © 2007, American Marketing Association.",,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses theoretical work on pricing strategies that impact long-term market behaviors and decisions regarding information quality, which aligns with strategic decision-making in marketing.",60,25,10,0,5

Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes.

Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study 1 show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party.

Yet the accessible literature in this area is rather limited. Of particular interest is the assessment of the extent to which behaviour is entirely volitional and thus completely under the physician's control. This would determine the extent to which external stimuli, such as communications from the pharmaceutical industry and the media, have any influence or not. On the basis of a small-scale study with 38 physicians in Greece, the importance of isolating normative beliefs and the motivation to comply has been identified as a key factor to understanding the decision process for prescriptions. The evidence shows that prediction of intended prescription behaviour increases significantly when behavioural control is added to the measurements of attitude and subjective norm.

For each of these stores, we observe the pricing strategy the firm has chosen to follow, as reported by the firm itself. Using a system of simultaneous discrete choice models, we estimate each store's choice of pricing strategy as a static discrete game of incomplete information. In contrast to the predictions of the theoretical literature, we find strong evidence that firms cluster by strategy by choosing actions that agree with those of its rivals.

This study’s objective was to evaluate the influence of cultural aspects in the buying decision, going beyond the TRM, and proposing the Consumer Cultural Influence Model (CCIM), which analyses the consumer choice based not only on values, but also on the social axioms construct, as proposed by Leung et al. (2002). To test the CCIM, the Brazilian higher education market was chose as study object.

After checking whether the assumptions were met, and Factor Analyses procedures, binary logistic regressions, among direct and sequential, were accomplished using only values, only axioms, and finally, values and axioms as criteria variables. In general, results show the stability of the CCIM, its superiority towards the TRM, with an increase in prediction of up to 89.5%. Whilst values are transituational and prescriptive, axioms are descriptive, accomplishing instrumental functions of attitudes related to objects description. Cognitively, the description of a social object is more available to the person than its prediction, due to the proximity of the attributes to the object, allowing a better explanation of the consumer behavior.

At present, they do so without much knowledge of the conceptual meaning or empirical properties of PE. In the spirit of construct explication, we report a study intended to address a series of questions about PE. Using student (N = 155) and community samples (N = 100), we found the following: (a) PE is a two-dimensional judgment involving global evaluations of message impact and specific judgments of message attributes, but it may be reducible to a single second-order factor, (b) most individuals reported using more than one referent (i.e., person or group) when making PE judgments, but the choice of referents varies by message and judge, and (c) judgments of PE are biased upward as a function of the number of referents chosen. Suggestions are offered for enhancing the validity of PE judgments in formative campaign research.

The truth is out there! How external validity can lead to better marketing decisions,Rogers G.; Soopramanien D.,2009,10.2501/S1470785309200402,"Marketing managers typically have to use and integrate many pieces of data and marketing intelligence when taking decisions such as whether to launch a product and, if so, at what price. Conjoint experiments and analysis remain popular marketing research tools with business practitioners to test and measure how the market will react to different actions. There is a growing body of work that focuses on, first, how to construct the experiments so that they better represent real market conditions and, second, the use of sophisticated model specifications that provide information on consumers' responses. The market researcher typically uses internal validation for model validity - a comparison of model prediction and within-sample holdout data. We contend in this paper that customers and users of market research information need to adopt a different and wider meaning of validity, referred to as external validity, to facilitate improved decision making. In this research, a case study is used as an example to demonstrate how marketing managers can use the information from a choice-based conjoint derived choice model differently depending on the manner in which the model validation is carried out. © 2009 The Market Research Society.",,Market Research Society,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses how marketing managers can use conjoint analysis and model validation to make informed decisions about product launches and pricing, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",20,60,15,0,5
Measuring the influence of individual preference structures in group decision making,Arora N.; Allenby G.M.,1999,10.2307/3152001,"Group purchase decisions are affected by the preference structures of individual members and the influence they have in the group. In this article, the authors develop a hierarchical Bayes model of group decision making that yields individual estimates of influence at the product attribute level. The authors show that the distribution of these estimates provides useful information for effectively managing marketing activities. In addition, the proposed model relates the measures of influence to covariates useful for identifying high-influence individuals. Predictive tests demonstrate that the proposed model, using an ""inferred"" measure of influence, leads to more accurate predictions than alternative measures.",,American Marketing Association,scopus-prediction,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a hierarchical Bayes model for group decision making in marketing, which involves predicting individual influence on purchase decisions. This aligns with tactical decision-making as it translates strategic goals into structured actions for effective marketing management.",20,60,15,0,5
Making futures research useful. The practitioner's opportunity,Backer H.S.,1984,10.1016/0016-3287(84)90105-8,"Futures research has a vital and practical contribution to make to the business world, to the improvement of marketing strategy. However, futures researchers need to have increased experience in a business environment to be fully aware of the multiplicity of factors to be considered in formulating a plan for marketing strategy and forecasting business events. Ultimately the futurists' greatest contribution is not one of accurate prediction but of orchestration and coordination of ideas from disparate sources. © 1984.",,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the role of futures research in shaping marketing strategies and emphasizes the long-term implications of understanding various factors in business forecasting.

Lateral influences and vertical authority in organizational buying,Robey D.; Johnston W.J.,1977,10.1016/0019-8501(77)90009-8,"Eight hypotheses are developed to guide research on the prediction of two structural dimensions of organizational buying behavior. The structural dimensions examined are: (1) the extent of lateral influence on buying decisions; and (2) the distribution of vertical authority for buying decisions. Predictor variables include organizational size, environmental diversity, environmental uncertainty, and the scope, complexity, and newness of the purchases themselves. Some implications of the hypotheses for industrial marketing management are also developed. © 1977.",,,scopus-prediction,Strategic,"The abstract discusses hypotheses that guide research on organizational buying behavior, which involves long-term planning and understanding of structural dimensions that affect buying decisions.
