"In the travel and hospitality industries, categorization of products, brands, and experiences permits efficient comparison and evaluation that aids decision making—from consumer choice to organizational strategy. However, categories often involve self-categorization (e.g., marketer defined) that may not reflect the reality of dynamic markets and industries. In this study of the cruise industry, we derive a new categorization approach using consumer perceptions of their cruise experiences to challenge a long-standing industry typology. Results using a variety of statistical tests of J.D. Power data from more than 3,000 cruisers yield a new and more informative category structure and assignment of cruise lines to it. Analyses reveal differences between the new cruise categories in terms of determinants that influence customer choice. Discussion highlights benefits to travel practitioners of using dynamic and customer-based categories, as well as to researchers of applying advanced statistical techniques to expose unexpected and insightful patterns in secondary data. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Li Y.; Kwortnik R.,Strategic,10.1177/0047287516674602,categorization; cruise industry; customer experience; data mining; marketing,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses a new categorization approach in the cruise industry based on consumer perceptions, which has implications for long-term decision making and organizational strategy in the travel and hospitality industries.",scopus-data mining,60,20,Categorizing Cruise Lines by Passenger Perceived Experience,2017
"Nowadays, data is developing with technology. With developments in the Internet and technology, it makes a warehouse that changes the data more rapidly and in volume. This situation increases the importance of data mining every day. The aim of this study is to examine classification algorithms which are the sub-subject of data mining. In the analysis part of the study, it is aimed to compare the algorithms with the accuracy ratio by using the financial data. As a result of the study conducted on stock marketing, the classification of enterprises of decision tree models with artificial neural networks has also been found to be more successful than other methods. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración.

"There is more than one mobile-phone subscription per member of the Australian population. The number of complaints against the mobile-phone-service providers is also high. Therefore, the mobile service providers are facing a huge challenge in retaining their customers. There are a number of existing models to analyse customer behaviour and switching patterns. A number of switching models may also exist within a large market. These models are often not useful due to the heterogeneous nature of the market. Therefore, in this study we use data mining techniques to let the data talk to help us discover switching patterns without requiring us to use any models and domain knowledge. We use a variety of decision tree and decision forest techniques on a real mobile-phone-usage dataset in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of data mining techniques in knowledge discovery. We report many interesting patterns, and discuss them from a brand-switching and marketing perspective, through which they are found to be very sensible and interesting © 2016 Islam, D’Alessandro, Furner, Johnson, Gray & Carter.

"The liberalisation of the European energy market has driven changes in the way firms approach marketing, both for the acquisition of new consumers and for retaining existing ones. To retain consumers, practitioners aim to predict which consumers intend to churn (ie leave), and to understand the reasons behind this intention. To address this need, this study uses data-mining techniques to develop a churn prediction model. The study aims to identify the information that is predictive of churn and, consequently, to shed light on the psychological reasons behind churn. The authors built eight predictive models using decision trees, random forest and logistic regression on a dataset composed of 81,813 consumers of an energy provider, each with one residential electricity contract. The logistic regression was found to outperform the other methods. The discussion focuses on the relevant predictors of churn by addressing a posteriori psychological explanations of consumers’ churn behaviour. The study provides new insights on the reasons why customers churn and, by addressing theoretical psychological explanations, provides a data-mining model with robustness to contextual changes. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Vezzoli M.; Zogmaister C.; Van den Poel D.,Tactical,,Churn prediction model; Consumer psychology; Customer churn; Energy market; Machine learning,5.0,,15,0,Henry Stewart Publications,"The study focuses on developing a churn prediction model, which is a structured approach to understand consumer behavior and retain customers, aligning more closely with tactical decision-making.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Will they stay or will they go?

"The application of business intelligence (BI) techniques for knowledge discovery and decision support empowers organizations in different functions. This article examines the impacts of BI on customer relationship management (CRM) functions (marketing, sales and customer services) in the telecommunications sector. The literature found that BI application in CRM in a telecommunications context is limited but necessary due to the high rate of competition between service providers and the massive data generated by subscribers. This study surveyed employees' perspectives from telecommunications companies in Oman, and results demonstrated mixed impacts. First, the results showed that implementing BI in marketing has a positive impact on business processes values, customer values, but a negative impact on employees' values. Second, implementing BI in sales has a positive impact on financial values and employees' values, but a negative impact on business processes values, and customers' values. Finally, implementing BI in customer service has a positive impact on employees' values. The study provides valuable guidelines for practitioners in the area of CRM, BI, and telecommunications to help understand why to invest in BI in specific CRM functions. © 2018, IGI Global.

"With the advent of users’ perspective to store personal information digitized, measures to protect their private information has necessitated. Organizations also publish anonymous data to facilitate research in social science, healthcare, identification of fraudulent users, and trend analysis to foster sales and marketing techniques. Privacy Preserving Data Mining [PPDM] protects the disclosure of sensitive information present in the published datasets. Most of the existing pool of algorithms perturb the attributes forbidding verification of original data at receivers’ end. This paper introduces a Reversible Data Perturbation iHiMod-Perturb approach efficient in privacy preservation and enabling recovery of original data, if needed, at the receiver end. Unlike traditional methods that adds/multiply noise or randomly project data, our method uses differences of adjoining values as basis for modification to perturb sensitive attributes. Selection of privacy factor and embedding of digital watermark ensures data integrity along with perturbation. The privacy factor enables user specific adaptable privacy preservation model in contrast to one-level model. Experiments are performed on five datasets from UCI Repository and confirms that the Classification Accuracy of the perturbed dataset is preserved well. Experiments also suggest that the Probability Information Loss [PIL] is less than 25% and Disclosure Risk [DR] is less than 8% after application of iHiMod-Perturb algorithm. © IJSTR 2019.",Shah A.K.; Gulati R.M.,Operational,,Decision Tree; Histogram Modification; Naïve Bayes; Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Reversible Data Perturbation; Support Vector Machines,5.0,,75,5,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,"The abstract discusses a specific data perturbation algorithm aimed at preserving privacy while allowing the recovery of original data.

"Learning the latent patterns of historical data in an efficient way to model the behaviour of a system is a major need for making right decisions. For this purpose, machine learning solution has already begun its promising marks in transportation as well as in many areas such as marketing, finance, education, and health. However, many classification algorithms in the literature assume that the target attribute values in the datasets are unordered, so they lose inherent order between the class values. To overcome the problem, this study proposes a novel ensemble-based ordinal classification (EBOC) approach which suggests bagging and boosting (AdaBoost algorithm) methods as a solution for ordinal classification problem in transportation sector. This article also compares the proposed EBOC approach with ordinal class classifier and traditional tree-based classification algorithms (i.e., C4.5 decision tree, RandomTree, and REPTree) in terms of accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed EBOC approach achieves better classification performance than the conventional solutions. © 2019 Pelin Yildirim et al.",Yildirim P.; Birant U.K.; Birant D.; Moghaddam M.H.Y.,Tactical,10.1155/2019/7482138,,5.0,,15,0,Hindawi Limited,The abstract discusses a novel ensemble-based ordinal classification approach aimed at improving decision-making processes within the transportation sector.

"The complexity of business decision-making has increased over the years. It is essential for managers to gain a confident understanding of their business environments in order to make successful decisions. With the growth of opinion-rich web resources such as social media, discussion forums, review sites, news corpora, and blogs available on the internet, product and service reviews have become an essential source of information. In a data-driven world, they will improve services and operational insights to achieve real business benefits and help enterprises remain competitive. Despite the prevalence of textual data, few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of real-time text mining and reporting tools in firms and organizations. To address this aspect of decision-making, we have developed and evaluated an unsupervised learning system to automatically extract and classify topics and their emotion score in text streams. Data were collected from commercial websites, open-access databases, and social networks to train the model. In the experiment, the polarity score was quantified at four different levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and the entire text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using subjective data mining, we demonstrate how to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of information from the Web and help traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to capture more information. An opinion tracking system presented by our model extracts subjective information, classifies them, and tracks opinions by utilizing location, time, and reviewers’ positions. Using the online-offline data collection technique, we can update the library topic in real-time to provide users with a market opinion tracker. For marketing or economic research, this approach may be useful. In the experiment, the new model is applied to a case study to demonstrate how the business process improves. © 2022, The Author(s).",Sigari S.; Gandomi A.H.,Tactical,10.1057/s41599-022-01325-y,,5.0,,20,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses the development of an unsupervised learning system for topic extraction and opinion tracking, which aligns with structured decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable insights.

"This research work focuses on integrating the multi attribute decision making with data mining in a fuzzy decision environment for customer relationship management. The main objective is to analyse the relation between multi attribute decision making and data mining considering a complex problem of ordering customers segments, which is based on four criteria of customer’s life time value, viz. length (L), recency (R), frequency (F) and monetary value (M). The proposed integrated approach involves fuzzy C-means (FCM) cluster analysis as data mining tool. The experiment conducted using MATLAB 12.0 for identifying eight clusters of customers. The two multi attribute decision making tools i.e., fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) are used for ranking these identified clusters. The applicability of the integrated decision making technique is also demonstrated in this paper considering the case of Indian retail sector. This research collected responses from nine experts from Indian retail industry regarding their perception of relative importance of four criteria of customer life value and evaluated weights of each criterion using fuzzy AHP. Transaction data of 18 months of the case retail store was analysed to segment 1,600 customers into eight clusters using fuzzy c-means clustering analysis technique. Finally, these eight clusters were ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The findings of this research could be helpful for firms in identifying the more valuable customers for them and allocate more resources to satisfy them. The findings will be also helpful in developing different loyalty program strategies for customers of different clusters. © 2021, Technical University of Liberec.

"Insurance companies that have adopted the application of data mining methods in their business have become more competitive in the insurance market. Data mining methods provides the insurance industry with numerous advantages: shorter data processing times, more sophisticated methods for more accurate data analysis, better decision-making, etc. Insurance companies use data mining methods for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to fraud prevention. The process of insurance premium pricing was one of the first applications of data mining methods in insurance industry. The application of the data mining method in this paper aims to improve the results in the process of non-life insurance premium ratemaking. The improvement is reflected in the choice of predictors or risk factors that have an impact on insurance premium rates. The following data mining methods for the selection of prediction variables were investigated: Forward Stepwise, Decision trees and Neural networks.

"Purpose: This paper aims to address the effective selection of customers for direct marketing campaigns. It introduces a new method to forecast campaign-related uplifts (also known as incremental response modeling or net scoring). By means of these uplifts, only the most responsive customers are targeted by a campaign. This paper also aims at calculating the financial impact of the new approach compared to the classical (gross) scoring methods. Design/methodology/approach: First, gross and net scoring approaches to customer selection for direct marketing campaigns are compared. After that, it is shown how net scoring can be applied in practice with regard to different strategical objectives. Then, a new statistic for net scoring based on decision trees is developed. Finally, a business case based on real data from the financial sector is calculated to compare gross and net scoring approaches. Findings: Whereas gross scoring focuses on customers with a high probability of purchase, regardless of being targeted by a campaign, net scoring identifies those customers who are most responsive to campaigns. A common scoring procedure – decision trees – can be enhanced by the new statistic to forecast those campaign-related uplifts. The business case shows that the selected scoring method has a relevant impact on economical indicators. Practical implications: The contribution of net scoring to campaign effectiveness and efficiency is shown by the business case. Furthermore, this paper suggests a framework for customer selection, given strategical objectives, e.g. minimizing costs or maximizing (gross or lift)-added value, and presents a new statistic that can be applied to common scoring procedures. Originality/value: Despite its lever on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, only few contributions address net scores up to now. The new χ2-statistic is a straightforward approach to the enhancement of decision trees for net scoring. Furthermore, this paper is the first to the application of net scoring with regard to different strategical objectives. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Michel R.; Schnakenburg I.; von Martens T.,Tactical,10.1108/JRIM-10-2015-0080,Customer analytics; Data mining; Database marketing; Direct marketing,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses methods for selecting customers for direct marketing campaigns, specifically focusing on net scoring and its practical applications, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Business analytics courses, such as marketing research, data mining, forecasting, and advanced financial modeling, have substantial predictive modeling components. The predictive modeling in these courses requires students to estimate and test many linear regressions. As a result, false positive variable selection (type I errors) is nearly certain to occur. This article describes an in-class demonstration that shows the frequency and impact of false positives on data mining regression-based predictive modeling. In this demonstration, 500 randomly generated independent (X) variables are individually regressed against a single, randomly generated (Y) variable, and the resulting 500 p-values are sorted and examined. This experiment is repeated and the distribution of the number of variables significant at the 5% level resulting from this simulation is presented and discussed. The demonstration provides a tangible example in which students see the reality and risks of incorrectly inferring statistical significance of independent regression variables. Students have expressed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the risks of type I errors through this demonstration. This demonstration is innovative because the scale of the simulation allows the students to experience the near certainty that the correlations shown in the results are truly random. © 2014 Decision Sciences Institute.",Pinder J.P.,Not Identified,10.1111/dsji.12037,Business Analytics; Hypothesis testing; Regression; Simulation,75.0,,5,0,Wiley-Blackwell,"The abstract discusses a demonstration related to the understanding of false positives in predictive modeling, which does not clearly fit into the strategic, tactical, or operational categories as defined.

"In light of the widely discussed political divide and increasing societal polarization, we investigate in this paper whether the polarization of political ideology extends to consumers’ preferences, intentions, and purchases. Using three different data sets—the publicly available social media data of over three million brand followerships of Twitter users, a YouGov brand-preference survey data set, and Nielsen scanner panel data—we assess the evolution of brand-preference polarization. We find that the apparent polarization in political ideologies after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 stretches further to the daily lives of consumers. We observe increased polarization in preferences, behavioral intentions, and actual purchase decisions for consumer brands. Consistent with compensatory consumption theory, we find that the increase in polarization following the election of Donald Trump was stronger for liberals relative to conservatives, and that this asymmetric polarization is driven by consumers’ demand for “Democratic brands” rather than the supply of such brands. From a brand perspective, there is evidence that brands that took a political stance observed a shift in their customer base in terms of their customers’ political affiliation. We provide publicly available (http://www.social-listening.org) access to the unique Twitter-based brand political affiliation scores. © 2022 The Author(s).",Schoenmueller V.; Netzer O.; Stahl F.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2022.1408,branding; data mining; political marketing; political polarization; social media,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of political polarization on consumer behavior and brand preferences, suggesting long-term trends in market dynamics and brand positioning.

"While browsing through an online video platform, potential viewers decide which videos to click and watch based on the information and impression they obtain from thumbnails. Therefore, a thumbnail needs to be able to tell potential viewers what the video is about (i.e., be informative), and at the same time, a thumbnail needs to grab potential viewers' attention (i.e., be visually appealing). Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we take the visual attributes that are relevant to the informativeness of thumbnails (e.g., element complexity and object complexity) as central route cues, take the visual attributes that are relevant to the aesthetics of thumbnails (e.g., celebrity endorsement, colorfulness, brightness, and image quality) as peripheral route cues, and explore the relation between these visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos using 3,745 marketing videos posted by 38 top brands across 4 industries – the automobile, beverage, restaurant, and toy industries – on YouTube. We construct our variables by extracting features from thumbnails using image mining techniques. Our study contributes to the literature on information systems and marketing by enhancing our understanding of the role of the visual attributes of images in persuading viewers in the online environment. Furthermore, our study provides a possible theoretical basis for studies on information processing and decision support that focus on automatic thumbnail selection. Finally, our study provides useful and practical guidelines for designing templates for optimal thumbnails that grab potential viewers' attention and yield more video views. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Koh B.; Cui F.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2022.113820,Branded video content; Elaboration likelihood model; Image mining; Thumbnails; Video view-through; Visual persuasion,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The study focuses on the specific visual attributes of thumbnails and their relation to video view-through rates, which are tactical decisions aimed at optimizing viewer engagement and marketing effectiveness.",scopus-data mining,10,70,An exploration of the relation between the visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos: The case of branded video content,2022

"As the Internet has found its place within different sectors of society, the use of various social networks is increasing and that is why they are utilized for business purposes. Most commercial companies need to do marketing in social networks in order to introduce their goods and/or services. In marketing, appropriate and accurate advertisement of goods based on needs of users of these social networks is required to sell the goods of different companies and manufacturing units in effective ways. In most cases, however, advertising and marketing methods in social networks are not correct and the resulted advertisements are boring and tiring to users and they might ignore them without noticing. Such advertisements will be considered as spam and will be annoying to network users. This is taken into consideration in the present study where users' interests, attitudes, and behavior on Facebook are specified through data mining techniques, based on which content marketing is conducted. The present study is conducted on the social network of Facebook, where content marketing, a new form of marketing, is utilized and instead of introducing the goods, the contents of different goods are presented. The data utilized in the study are actual and related to Facebook users, and therefore, the results can be generalized to other networks. © 2014, Saman Forouzandeh, Heirsh Soltanpanah, & Amir Sheikhahmadi.",Forouzandeh S.; Soltanpanah H.; Sheikhahmadi A.,Tactical,,Advertisement; Data mining; Decision tree; Marketing; Social networks,5.0,,15,0,University of Tehran,"The study focuses on content marketing strategies on Facebook, analyzing user interests and behaviors to enhance marketing effectiveness, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Content marketing through data mining on Facebook social network,2014
"Identifying dominating features that affect individual information retweeting behavior on social networking sites (SNSs) is crucial to understanding individual retweeting behaivor and developing effective marketing strategies on SNS. However, there is little agreement on what factors are dominating individual information disseminating behavior on SNS, and what’s worse, more and more factors are added into the prediction model, without examining the relevance of them and even why these factors are added is rarely discussed. This leads to undesirable outcomes such as increasing the cost of measuring and computing irrelevant/redundant features. Most importantly, it hinders us from understanding what discriminative features are affecting individual information disseminating behavior. Using a unique real-life Twitter data set consisting of 55,575 twitterers and 9,440,321 tweets, the authors examine what discriminative features are dominating individual information disseminating behavior. The results indicate that topic distance is the most discriminative factor, highlighting that self-presentation motives play an important role in information disseminating decisions. Besides, the amount of information, social relationship and the popularity of the tweet also contribute to individual information disseminating decisions. Experiments demonstrate that adopting only dominating factors can improve prediction performance in terms of various indicators, compared with adopting the full features set.

"Sales and marketing is the indispensable department of an organization which leads to the generation of revenue and building customer relationship. Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns. This paper discusses the use of the data mining concept on marketing. This paper aims to analyze marketing data with k-means data mining clustering techniques and to find the relationship between marketing and k-means data mining clustering techniques. © 2022 Russian Association of Forensic Medical Experts.

"Purpose: This research proposes a new modified Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model by extending the model with spatial analysis for supporting decision-makers in discovering the promotional target market. Research design, data and methodology: This quantitative research utilizes data-mining techniques and the RFM model to cluster a university's provider schools. The RFM model was modified by adapting its variables to the university's marketing context and adding a district's potential (D) variable based on heatmap analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) and K-means clustering. The K-prototype algorithm and the Elbow method were applied to find provider school clusters using the proposed RFM-D model. After profiling the clusters, the target segment was assigned. The model was validated using empirical data from an Indonesian university, and its performance was compared to the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)-based RFM utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. Results: This research identified five clusters. The target segment was chosen from the highest-value and high-value clusters that comprised 17.80% of provider schools but can contribute 75.77% of students. Conclusions: The proposed model recommended more targeted schools in higher-potential districts and predicted the target segment with 0.99 accuracies, outperforming the CLV-based model. The empirical findings help university management determine the promotion location and allocate resources for promotional information distribution and student recruitment. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://Creat¡vecommons.org/l¡censes/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Ernawati; Baharin S.S.K.; Kasmin F.,Tactical,10.15722/jds.20.06.202206.1,Information distribution; Rfm; Spatial analysis; Student recruitment; Target market,5.0,,15,0,Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA),"The research focuses on using a modified RFM model to identify target segments for promotional activities, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"In the last decade, the use of Data Sciences, which facilitate decision-making and extraction of actionable insights and knowledge from large datasets in the digital marketing environment, has remarkably increased. However, despite these advances, relevant evidence on the measures to improve the management of Data Sciences in digital marketing remains scarce. To bridge this gap in the literature, the present study aims to review (i) methods of analysis, (ii) uses, and (iii) performance metrics based on Data Sciences as used in digital marketing techniques and strategies. To this end, a comprehensive literature review of major scientific contributions made so far in this research area is undertaken. The results present a holistic overview of the main applications of Data Sciences to digital marketing and generate insights related to the creation of innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery techniques. Important theoretical implications are discussed, and a list of topics is offered for further research in this field.

"This research presents a new approach to derive recommendations for segment-specific, targeted marketing campaigns on the product category level. The proposed methodological framework serves as a decision support tool for customer relationship managers or direct marketers to select attractive product categories for their target marketing efforts, such as segment-specific rewards in loyalty programs, cross-merchandising activities, targeted direct mailings, customized supplements in catalogues, or customized promotions. The proposed methodology requires customers’ multi-category purchase histories as input data and proceeds in a stepwise manner. It combines various data compression techniques and integrates an optimization approach which suggests candidate product categories for segment-specific targeted marketing such that cross-category spillover effects for non-promoted categories are maximized. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed procedure, we examine the transactions from a real-world loyalty program of a major grocery retailer. A simple scenario-based analysis using promotion responsiveness reported in previous empirical studies and prior experience by domain experts suggests that targeted promotions might boost profitability between 15 % and 128 % relative to an undifferentiated standard campaign. © 2016, The Author(s).",Reutterer T.; Hornik K.; March N.; Gruber K.,Tactical,10.1007/s11573-016-0823-7,Association rule mining; Clustering; Cross-category purchases; Customized coupons; Target marketing,5.0,,10,0,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The abstract describes a methodological framework that provides decision support for customer relationship managers to select attractive product categories for targeted marketing campaigns.

"Analyzing and extracting insights from user-generated data has become a topic of interest among businesses and research groups because such data contains valuable information, e.g., consumers’ opinions, ratings, and recommendations of products and services. However, the true value of social media data is rarely discovered due to overloaded information. Existing literature in analyzing online hotel reviews mainly focuses on a single data resource, lexicon, and analysis method and rarely provides marketing insights and decision-making information to improve business’ service and quality of products. We propose an integrated framework which includes a data crawler, data preprocessing, sentiment-sensitive tree construction, convolution tree kernel classification, aspect extraction and category detection, and visual analytics to gain insights into hotel ratings and reviews. The empirical findings show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms as well as well-known sentiment classification methods, and achieves high precision (0.95) and recall (0.96). The visual analytics results reveal that Business travelers tend to give lower ratings, while Couples tend to give higher ratings. In general, users tend to rate lowest in July and highest in December. The Business travelers more frequently use negative keywords, such as “rude,” “terrible,” “horrible,” “broken,” and “dirty,” to express their dissatisfied emotions toward their hotel stays in July. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chang Y.-C.; Ku C.-H.; Chen C.-H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.11.001,Google trends; Hospitality; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; TripAdvisor; Visual analytics,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses an integrated framework for analyzing user-generated data and provides insights into hotel ratings and reviews which can be used for marketing analytics, user engagement, and decision-making at a structured level, making it fit for tactical classification.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Social media analytics: Extracting and visualizing Hilton hotel ratings and reviews from TripAdvisor,2019
"Social media data contain rich information in posts or comments written by customers. If those data can be extracted and analysed properly, companies can fully utilise this rich source of information. They can then convert the data to useful information or knowledge, which can help to formulate their business strategy. This cannot only facilitate marketing research in view of customer behaviour, but can also aid other management disciplines. Operations management (OM) research and practice with the objective to make decisions on product and process design is a fine example. Nevertheless, this line of thought is under-researched. In this connection, this paper explores the role of social media data in OM research. A structured approach is proposed, which involves the analysis of social media comments and a statistical cluster analysis to identify the interrelationships amongst important factors. A real-life example is employed to demonstrate the concept. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chan H.K.; Lacka E.; Yee R.W.Y.; Lim M.K.,Tactical,10.1080/00207543.2015.1053998,cluster analysis; content analysis; operations management; social media,0.0,,15,5,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the analysis of social media data for operational decision-making in operations management, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into more structured targets, characteristic of tactical decision-making.",scopus-data mining,20,60,The role of social media data in operations and production management,2017
"Telecommunication industry has proven itself as a chain of socio-economic impact. Market leaders should take advantage of data analysis consecutively as the need to sustain customers the longest possible time. This research is based on community detection analysis through identifying group members and influencers in the telecommunication industry. It is motivated by two major research questions: Who are th e influencers in subscribers for churn and new products adoptions? (2) Who are subscribers whose loyalty is threatened by churn around them? The use of data analysis and data mining algorithms and standard process in today‘s challenges was set to increase the efficiency of solving not only technical problems but business as to move toward insights and analysis based exercises. This research proposes a model based on the Similarity, Authority and Hub algorithms used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) to group members who share same patterns together, to identify network leaders in terms of authority and dissemination leaders and to extract group level insights that can be used in understanding subscribers‘ patterns and ways of communications (in-degrees and out-degrees) between them using IBM SPSS Modeler as the base of data mining process and Oracle as the base of corporate data warehouse. This study estimated how much reliable is to use SNA in order to shift from the traditional ways of targeting subscribers, understanding their pattern, enhancing offering efficiency and improving the process of launching new product by selecting the right target. It has contributed to shifting marketing leaders‘ way of thinking from individual view to network view. It has also contributed to providing decision makers with a systematic and scientific approach as to focus on network influencers, to save as much as they can and to build their offers based on it. © 2020 IJSTR.",Assaf R.,Tactical,,Authority; Data analysis; Data mining; Dissemination; SNA; Social network analysis; SPSS molder; SQL: SPSS Modeler,10.0,,10,0,International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research,"The abstract focuses on identifying influencers and subscriber patterns in the telecommunication industry to improve marketing strategies and customer retention.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the drivers of visitation intention, including demographic, psychographic (animosity, national attachment and consumer ethnocentrism) and image factors on tourist decision-making in a situation of bilateral conflict between the destination country and the source country, that is, the USA and Russia, respectively. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected at two different points in time from two different samples but analyzed with the same research question in mind. To increase the robustness and validity of findings, three analytical approaches from the repertoire of statistics and data mining techniques such as hierarchical linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree analysis were applied to two independent samples of tourists with different demographic profiles. This multiple methods research employs a complementary design, as methods used have equal importance and are applied concurrently. Findings: The paper obtained generally consistent results across methods and samples: general animosity, destination image and country image are the most influential factors in the tourists’ decision-making to visit a destination country with which their own country has strained bilateral relations. Practical implications: Destination image is highly important in all analyses and is more favorable than country image. It indicates some degree of separation of the two images in the respondents’ mind, which indicates that marketing a country as a tourist destination on a not-so-friendly tourism market may still be effective. Results also tentatively indicate that for young adults, patriotic feelings matter more in their decision-making, while for more mature tourists, ethnocentric tendencies play a more important role. Originality/value: The paper examines the influence of general and situational animosity, national attachment, and consumer ethnocentrism on visitation intentions in a situation of conflict between the two nations and, thus, expands the empirical evidence accumulated to date on tourist behavior in conflict. The paper acts on the premise that if a connection between any two variables truly exists, it should be able to withstand variations in samples, timing of data collection and measurement, thus, leading to more robust findings. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.",Stepchenkova S.; Kirilenko A.P.; Shichkova E.,Strategic,10.1108/IJTC-11-2018-0085,Animosity; Consumer ethnocentrism; Decision tree; Multiple methods research; National attachment,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of factors influencing tourist decision-making in the context of bilateral conflict, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and understanding market behavior.",scopus-data mining,60,25,Influential factors for intention to visit an adversarial nation: increasing robustness and validity of findings,2019
"The role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in disseminating and protecting children’s rights is fundamental by increasing society’s knowledge about the reality that children face, thus mobilizing citizen attention. In this paper, we present an original study on social media data, specifically Twitter, to analyze childhood NGOs, evaluating the success of their content (through the likes obtained by publications) from the perspective of social marketing and prospective theory. In addition, it examines the positioning of organizations concerning the types of messages identified. The methodological approach is based on data mining, content analysis, and simple correspondence analysis through which the typology of the messages and positioning map are determined. The results suggest that these organizations generate predictable communication by publishing on specific topics and only increasing the number of tweets in emergencies when they are requiring urgent help. Some tweets show an immediate risk to which children are exposed if they do not receive help, which aligns with one of the premises of the Prospect Theory. Furthermore, a more significant number of posts does not necessarily imply a greater number of likes. Three types of messages have been determined: informative tweets that point out risks (type 1), impartial dialogue tweets (type 2), and action tweets that highlight benefits (type 3), confirmed through the Kruskal-Wallis test to have a relationship with impact. The positioning map shows that type 3 messages, which World Vision Spain opts for, are the most popular, followed by type 1, which Educo leans towards. Finally, there are those of type 2, with which UNICEF Spain is associated. The main implication is that our analysis validates the use of social media such as Twitter to analyze NGOs and proposes these social media platforms to be an important tool in mobilizing the community. In addition, this study offers parameters when constructing the messages for use in social marketing campaigns according to decisions that involve risk or certainty. © The Author(s) 2024.",Galiano-Coronil A.; Alcedo-Velázquez M.Y.; Blanco-Moreno S.; Tobar Pesántez L.B.,Tactical,10.1057/s41599-024-02611-7,,5.0,,15,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses the analysis of social media data and the effectiveness of different types of tweets from NGOs, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into structured actions, such as content optimization and user engagement in social media.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Comparison and positioning of NGOs aimed at children from the perspective of social marketing on Twitter,2024
"Banks apply credit scoring to identify customers with low credit risk. Additionally, recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM) analysis method is suitable for identifying valuable bank customers. Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns hidden in customer data. However, in previous research, data mining has been used separately in both credit scoring and RFM approaches. To evaluate customer behaviour, banks must employ credit scoring and RFM analysis method, simultaneously. This study proposes a framework for using data mining techniques to integrate credit scoring and RFM methods in the field of banking. In this framework, k-means had better performance than Kohonen network and DBSCAN to identify and cluster valuable customers based on the RFM and credit scoring indices. Moreover, the C5 decision tree, BN, and SVM with 94.10%, 92.71%, and 92.36% accuracy had better performance to classify valuable bank customers based on RFM and credit scoring indices.

"Direct marketing campaigns are one of the main fundraising sources for nonprofit organizations and their effectiveness is crucial for the sustainability of the organizations. The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted. Finally, this work shows and compares the classification results obtained with the combination of sampling techniques and Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and Artificial Neural Networks. The testing approach follows a walk-forward validation procedure, which simulates a production environment and reveals the ability to accurately classify each future campaign. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Cacciarelli D.; Boresta M.,Tactical,10.1002/nvsm.1724,direct marketing; machine learning; target selection,5.0,,10,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses data mining approaches for optimizing direct marketing campaigns, which fall under tactical decision-making as it involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets for campaign effectiveness.",scopus-data mining,15,70,What drives a donor?

"We have investigated processes of analysis, integration, and content generation, taking into consideration the needs of the user in cryptocurrency. By using the developed formal model and the performed critical analysis of methods and technologies for predicting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency, we have built a general architecture of the content processing system that acquires data from different cryptocurrency Internet stock exchanges. General functional requirements to the intelligent cryptocurrency system that target the Internet users have been stated. We have investigated methods, models, and tools to improve the effective support for developing structural elements in the model of a decision support system that manages content according to the user's needs. general architectures of the backend and frontend parts of an intelligent cryptocurrency system have been devised. We also developed software for the system of integration and generation of content considering the cryptocurrency needs of users. An analysis of results of experimental verification of the proposed method for content integration and generation taking into consideration the cryptocurrency needs of users has been performed. A special feature of the system is that it analyzes information from social media and builds a forecast of currency rates based on the acquired information. A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate. The focus of the system is on the frequency of updates at the speed of data aggregation from the Internet stock exchanges and social networks. © 2019, V. Lytvyn, V. Vysotska, V. Kuchkovskiy, I.

"Purpose – Today the garment industry in México is vulnerable to complex problems. This type of industry is subject to influences which over time, modify the perceptions of those involved in the design process due to the fact that they face problems that have both objective and subjective characteristics. In this study the authors used interviews, direct observation methodology, and theoretical argumentation to obtain the experts knowledge as they describe the problems that arise in the process of garment design for Mexican markets. The purpose of this paper is to generate a methodology so that the expert in this field will become highly specialized, resulting in heightened abilities and reinforcing them with the methodology of soft systems and the design management model (DMM). The results suggest that they are applicable to any area of design. Design/methodology/approach – The success or failure of expert system (ES) depends directly on the acquisition of knowledge (Méndez-Gurrola, 2007, 2012), to accomplish that, three large groups of techniques are used to extract that knowledge: manual, semiautomatic, and automatic. Within the group of manual techniques, interviews, protocol analysis, questionnaires, direct on site observation, and the extraction of closed curves are emphasized. This technique is chosen for its ability to extract the particular type of knowledge being sought. The knowledge of the dominion expert in the design process applied to the clothing industry in México is based on processes and at the same time is episodic, meaning that part of the procedure is automated and each step of the process triggers the next. This knowledge is also based on experience which is of an autobiographical nature. Findings – First, when one simulates human behavior, the hardest thing is to choose a knowledge representation that conforms as closely as possible to its emulation. According to, choosing a given type of knowledge representation is an art that is discovered little by little. And this is true as one designs and assembles a representation, when one realizes how far the authors are from imitating the design of the human brain processes, and discovers or invents methodologies to achieve it, combining the results of investigations into knowledge representation, cognitive psychology, and cognitive engineering. Second, solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process. One needs the ability to identify the signals emitted by complex situations, and being able to stop them in time before they create irreversible damage. By merging the soft system methodology (SSM) and DMM with the experts’ abilities and knowledge (the result being the EXITUS model (EM)), makes knowledge modeling possible. A problem cannot be solved if it is unknown, if the problem persists and grows it becomes more complex. By describing a problem, based on: its origin, its relationship, and its effects, it also confers the ability to solve it. Thereby, an SBC with the characteristics presented in this paper, not only improves the design process function as a whole, it also contributes to achieving corporate success. Finally, it influences directly on: a quality product; market positioning; and good economic results. First, the SBC-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the SBC-EXITUS system, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Fourth, in this project an SBC named SBC-EXITUS has been implemented using the SSM and the DMM, with the purpose of detecting possible problems in the design process of the clothing industry. Its implementation is developed by the use of production rules. Fifth, utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation thnique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to other areas of design. Practical implications – Utilizing the methodology and the production rules like knowledge representation technique, make possible to acquire dominion knowledge in complex problems as in the study case clothing industry in México. This approach is also applicable to the garment industry in the international context, as well as to other areas of design such as architecture, furniture, and others. The EM is a generic methodology. In this research and case, it has been applied in a design process within the garment industry, specifically in a case in Mexico. Yet this does not limit its use in a different context and problem situation. Having in mind the difference between countries in aspects such as sponsoring, technology, worker skills, marketing, etc. the tools for diagnostics in the Appendix 2, may be adapted to each context with enriched questions directed to specific aspects involved. Every new application allows facts and production rules that make the use of ES more efficient. Social implications – The ES-EXITUS was tested and endorsed by expert management designers. When a designer identifies a complex problem using the ES-EXITUS, he is capable of verifying its existence with facts and real life situations. This enables quicker decision making decisions, which saves time and money, due to the fact that a non-desirable state of affairs may be contemplated in advance. Originality/value – Solving any complex situation in the design process function of the clothing industry is no easy task. It requires plenty of experience in the manufacturing process. One needs the ability to identify the signals emitted by complex situations, and being able to stop them in time before they create irreversible damage. By merging the SSM and DMM with the experts’ abilities and knowledge (the result being the EM), makes knowledge modeling possible. A problem cannot be solved if it is unknown, if the problem persists and grows it becomes more complex. By describing a problem, based on: its origin, its relationship and its effects, it also confers the ability to solve it. Thereby, an SBC with the characteristics presented in this paper, not only improves the design process function as a whole, it also contributes to achieving corporate success. Finally, it influences directly on a quality product, market positioning, and good economic results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Santiago-Santiago K.; Laureano-Cruces A.L.; Antuñano-Barranco J.M.A.; Domínguez-Pérez O.; Sarmiento-Bustos E.,Strategic,10.1108/IJCST-08-2013-0084,Clothing industry; Expert systems; Knowledge representation; Production rules,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a methodology aimed at enhancing the garment design process in Mexico, focusing on long-term improvements and the application of expert knowledge, which aligns with strategic planning objectives.",scopus-data mining,60,25,An expert system to improve the functioning of the clothing industry: A development methodology,2015

"The report “Accenture China Consumer Insight 2018 - New Consumption Power” published by FT Chinese Network and Accenture, a well-known international consulting company, has poined out one of the characteristics of new consumerism: experience is paramount. Consumers' demand for experiential shopping has led to the formation of a new sales pattern, and the O2O sales model emphasizing experiential marketing has become a hot topic of common concern in the business and academic circles. The formulation of product quality level and sales service level strategies by enterprises is often affected by both consumers’ behaviors and supply chain members’ behaviors: On the one hand, considering the influence of the difference between the reference level and the actual experience level on consumer demand, this paper incorporates both the reference quality effect of online consumers and the reference service effect on offline channels into goodwill dynamics and demand function of consumers. On the other hand, supply chain members often do not comply with the assumption of “economic man” in traditional economics when they interact with each other, While they often have a certain social preference - reciprocity altruism, that is, they not only consider their own benefits, but also pay attention to each other's benefits to a certain extent. For this reason, this paper regards the utilities maximization of reciprocity altruism as the objectives of supply chain members when making decisions. To sum up, considering the inherent dynamics of supply chain operation and consumers’ reference effects in the supply chain system under O2O mode which is composed of a dominated manufacturer and a retailer selling through both online and offline, the differential game models among decentralized, centralized and reciprocal altruistic decision-making pattern are constructed by using differential game theory, manufacturer's quality level strategy, retailer's dominant service level strategy, and supply chain's profits and utilities are obtains among three decision-making modes. Through comparison, we find that: 1) The reference effects of consumers cause the “anchoring psychology”, which leads to manufacturers' lowering quality level, retailers' lowering service level, and also damages the performance of the product-service supply chain. 2) Consumer's channel preference has an important impact on supply chain members' strategies and performance. Retailers should encourage consumers to purchase products online and use offline channel services as sales assistance measures to satisfy consumers' experience utility. 3) Members' reciprocal altruistic behavior as a positive social preference can obtain Pareto improvement in supply chain performance compared with decentralized decision-making model. and also result in additional social benefits; 4) If and only if both manufacturer and retailer have pure altruistic behavior preferences, i. e. the lowest return and the highest altruism, the total profit of supply chain can reach the situation of centralized decision-making. To this end, the management inspiration of this paper is: due to many management drawbacks of centralized decision-making, such as high management costs and difficulty in implementation, supply chain members should actively display the social preferences of mutual benefit and altruism, and deepen the vertical cooperation of supply chain on the basis of independent decision-making. On the one hand, manufacturer can improve product quality through product innovation, strictly control product quality to enhance brand goodwill, form quality identity and lay a good quality foundation for retailer sales links. On the other hand, retailer should undertake the sales link of supply chain to serve consumers' experience consumption: recommending personalized products to customers at lower cost through advanced technologies such as data mining, setting up 24-hour online customer service, solving customers' pre-sale doubts, reducing the adverse effects of reference service in online channel. While in offline channel, he can establish a reasonable membership system, take feedback promotion activities regularly and feed old customers to improve their retention rate and loyalty, even use word-of-mouth effect to attract new customers and tap new consumer market potential. Through the mutual benefits and altruism of manufacturer and retailer, the supply chain division of labor can be carried out to comprehensively improve the quality level and service capacity from the production end to the sales end, build brand goodwill, and promote win-win situation in all channels. © 2021.

"This study proposes a framework for assisting decision-makers in selecting a target market using a Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) based model. This study aims to identify a university's promotional target market for student recruitment and develop a geo-marketing strategy. This study employed a modified RFM model tailored to the university's marketing context, combining it with spatial analysis to quantify feeder schools ""value"" and temporal analysis to examine the enrollment patterns of the highest value feeder schools using data mining techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS). A case study of an Indonesian university was used in this study. This study identified 108 (4.63%) out of 2,334 feeder schools as the prioritized target market, contributing 51.54% of 18,537 enrolled students to the university during the analysis period. The prioritized feeder schools are in 32 cities and 23 regencies from 368 cities/regencies, with the majority being private schools. The research's findings revealed the distribution of feeder schools in regencies/cities and the trend of enrolled students from the highest value feeder schools segment, which can assist university management in selecting target feeder schools more precisely. Based on the findings, decision-makers can create a geo-marketing strategy for promotional activities and direct resources to the prioritized feeder schools. This study contributes by reinforcing a modified RFM model with spatial and temporal analysis to help university decision-makers choose feeder schools as the university's target market and develop a geo-marketing strategy. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

"Location analytics offers statistical analysis of any geo-or spatial data concerning user location. Such analytics can produce useful insights into the attractions of interest to travellers or visitation patterns of a demographic group. Based on these insights, strategic decision-making by travel marketing agents, such as travel package design, may be improved. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an original method of location analytics to analyse travellers' social media data for improving managerial decision support. The method proposes an architectural framework that combines emerging pattern data mining techniques with image processing to identify and process appropriate data content. The design artefact is evaluated through a focus group and a detailed case study of Australian outbound travellers.

"With the development of e-commerce platforms, online customer reviews have become an important instrument for providing product word-of-mouth (WoM) information. Analyzing and measuring WoM is quite valuable in product design, sales prediction, marketing strategy, and other decision-making tasks. In contrast to previous studies that analyze product WoM focusing on a single product, we propose an influence framework to measure WoM from a market perspective. In this framework, we combine product competition relationships and customer intercommunication relationships to construct a two-layer network and calculate the node influence effects in the network. To compare different product WoM measures, we use product sales as a predictor and build a series of predictive models. In the experiments conducted based on Amazon.com data, we find that, first, textual sentiment analysis produces a better summary of customer opinions than rating scores. Second, product-comparative relationships provide additional information on measuring product WoM. Third, the customer intercommunication feature in social media is useful for measuring the collective opinions about a product. The influence framework and experimental findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Chen K.; Luo P.; Wang H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.im.2016.06.010,Product network; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses an influence framework for measuring product word-of-mouth (WoM) from a market perspective, which involves analyzing customer reviews and product competition.

"Purpose: Tourism development can reduce the economic disadvantages of indigenous tribes; however, it is also reproached for the destruction of local culture. The challenge for tourism and culture is to reach those diverse audiences through a multicultural marketing perspective for managers to make decisions. Therefore, learning the activity preferences of tourism experiences and creating the value of indigenous tourism by strategies are essential indicators of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The knowledge lacks cultural understanding and the acceptance of prices concerned with indigenous tourism. This research introduces the value of cultural experience into indigenous tourism experiences and establishes a link between the attributes of tourists' preferences and tourism. The data mining methods are used to analyze relevant indigenous tribal data on the cultural experience. Findings: By providing a different quality of service for various tourists, it is expected to improve the sustainable tourism of the tribe through the experiential value of different attributes and strategies of push–pull factors. Research limitations/implications: The experiential activities are based on second-hand data collected from Taitung's indigenous tourism activities, and sample data are the domestic tourism experiences of tourists over the past year. Through empirical analyses, the attributes of tourists' preferences can create the value of the cultural experience for indigenous tourism.

"Identification of changes in customer behavior is a major challenge that must be tackled in order to survive in a rapidly changing business environment. For example, because information technology has advanced and data-storage costs have declined, for the purpose of serving customers, numerous enterprises have employed information systems and have directly logged customer behavior in databases. This trend has motivated the development of data mining applications. Fuzzy quantitative sequential pattern mining is a functional data mining technique that is used for discovering customer behavioral patterns over time and determining the quantities of goods or services they purchase. The example term used in shopping 〈[(Beer, Low)(Milk, High)] (Cola, Middle)〉 means that customers will first buy Beer and Milk in Low and High quantities, respectively, and then purchase Cola in Middle quantities on their next shopping trip, where Low, Middle, and High are predefined linguistic terms assigned by managers. A term such as this one provides managers with general and concise knowledge related to customer behavior and allows them to rapidly make decisions in response, especially in a competitive setting. However, literature searches indicate that no previous study has addressed the issue of changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. The aforementioned example pattern might have been available last year but might not be used this year, and it could have been substituted by 〈(Beer, Middle) {(Cola, Low)(Milk, Low)}〉. If this knowledge is not renewed, managers might develop inappropriate marketing plans for their products or services and use inventory strategies that are outdated with respect to time and quantities. To solve this problem, we propose a novel change-mining model that can be used for detecting changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. We conducted experiments in which we used real-world and synthetic datasets in order to evaluate the proposed model. When the pattern change was detected using the real-world dataset, the results showed that the model reveals 3 considerations that can help managers with their handling of products’ marketing and production. When we studied the model’s scalability by using the synthetic dataset, the results showed that even though all run times increased when parameter values were decreased, the model remained scalable. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Huang C.-K.; Chang T.-Y.; Narayanan B.G.,Tactical,10.1007/s10799-014-0197-x,Change mining; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Quantitative data; Sequential patterns,5.0,,15,0,Springer New York LLC,"The abstract discusses a novel change-mining model for detecting changes in customer behavioral patterns, which is aimed at helping managers make informed decisions regarding marketing and inventory strategies.

"Retailers are facing challenges in making sense of the significant amount of data available for a better understanding of their customers. While retail analytics plays an increasingly important role in successful retailing management, comprehensive store segmentation based on Data Mining-based Retail Analytics is still an under-researched area. This study seeks to address this gap by developing a novel approach to segment the stores of retail chains based on ‘purchasing behavior of customers’ and applying it in a case study. The applicability and benefits of using Data Mining techniques to examine purchasing behavior and identify store segments are demonstrated in a case study of a global retail chain in Istanbul, Turkey. Over 600 K transaction data of a global grocery retailer are analyzed and 175 stores in Istanbul are successfully segmented into five segments. The results suggest that the proposed new retail analytics approach enables the retail chain to identify clusters of stores in different regions using all transaction data and advances our understanding of store segmentation at the store level. The proposed approach will provide the retail chain the opportunity to manage store clusters by making data-driven decisions in marketing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, inventory management and demand forecasting. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bilgic E.; Cakir O.; Kantardzic M.; Duan Y.; Cao G.,Tactical,10.1080/09593969.2021.1915847,business analytics; Data mining; data-driven decision making; purchasing behavior; store segmentation,5.0,,10,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on applying data mining techniques to segment stores based on customer purchasing behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in retail management.

"Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers 'preference indicator. © 2023 All rights reserved",Filipas A.M.; Vretenar N.; Prudky I.,Operational,10.18045/zbefri.2023.1.157,Consumers'preferences; Data mining; Decision trees; Decision-making; Shopping behaviour indicators,10.0,,60,0,University of Rijeka,"The research focuses on understanding consumer preferences in online shopping, which involves determining influences on consumer behavior and constructing preference indicators.

"This paper seeks to compare certain customer segments from two sport footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers and to examine an objective market segmentation method, based on the recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) and the decision tree (DT) models. The case study is based on two data sets, aiming to compare the different customer segments, both from sport retail industry, and represents an application of data mining techniques in a business environment. The customer segmentation enables the customer selection for the future direct marketing campaigns based on the previous purchasing behavior. Analyzing the customers’ purchasing history can help the company determine the value of each customer and therefore target or not target such customers in the future with promotional materials, based on both the customers’ interests and their value. Thus, based on the results, personalized offers can be created for each of the defined customer groups, which may increase the efficiency of the overall campaign, reduce costs, and increase profitability.

"Customer response models have gained popularity due to their ability to significantly improve the likelihood of targeting the customers most likely to buy a product or a service. These models are built using databases of previous customers’ buying decisions. However, a smaller number of customers in these databases often bought the product or service than those who did not do so, resulting in unbalanced datasets. This problem is especially significant for online marketing campaigns when the class imbalance emerges due to many website sessions. Unbalanced datasets pose a specific challenge in data-mining modelling due to the inability of most of the algorithms to capture the characteristics of the classes that are unrepresented in the dataset. This paper proposes an approach based on a combination of random undersampling and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification applied to the unbalanced dataset to create a Balanced SVM (B-SVM) data pre-processor resulting in a dataset that is analysed with several classifiers. The experiments indicate that using the B-SVM strategy combined with classification methods increases the base models’ predictive performance, indicating that the B-SVM approach efficiently pre-processes the data, correcting noise and class imbalance. Hence, companies may use the B-SVM approach to more efficiently select customers more likely to respond to a campaign. © 2022 by the authors.",Rogić S.; Kašćelan L.; Pejić Bach M.,Tactical,10.3390/jtaer17030051,customer response model; data mining; data pre-processing; direct marketing; support vector machine; unbalanced data,5.0,,15,0,MDPI,"The abstract discusses the application of a specific method (B-SVM) to enhance predictive performance in targeting customers for marketing campaigns, which fits within the tactical decision-making level by interpreting strategic goals into actionable models.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Customer Response Model in Direct Marketing: Solving the Problem of Unbalanced Dataset with a Balanced Support Vector Machine,2022

"How to increase competitiveness of SMEs? How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews.

"Facing the problem of variation and chaotic behavior of customers, the lack of sufficient information is a challenge to many business organizations. Human analysts lacking an understanding of the hidden patterns in business data, thus, can miss corporate business opportunities. In order to embrace all business opportunities, enhance the competitiveness, discovery of hidden knowledge, unexpected patterns and useful rules from large databases have provided a feasible solution for several decades. While there is a wide range of financial analysis products existing in the financial market, how to customize the investment portfolio for the customer is still a challenge to many financial institutions. This paper aims at developing an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) for extracting customer behavior in the financial industry, so as to increase the availability of decision support data and hence increase customer satisfaction. The proposed financial model first clusters the customers into several sectors, and then finds the correlation among these sectors. It is noted that better customer segmentation can increase the ability to identify targeted customers, therefore extracting useful rules for specific clusters can provide an insight into customers' buying behavior and marketing implications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a simple dataset is collected from a financial company in Hong Kong. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can improve the workflow of a financial company, but also deepen understanding of investment behavior. Thus, a corporation is able to customize the most suitable products and services for customers on the basis of the rules extracted.",Mak M.K.Y.; Ho G.T.S.; Ting S.L.,Tactical,10.5772/50937,Association rules mining; Clustering; Customer behavior; Data mining; Financial industry,5.0,,15,0,InTech Europe,"The abstract discusses the development of an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) aimed at improving customer segmentation and behavior analysis, which aligns with tactical decision-making in targeting and personalization efforts within the financial industry.",scopus-data mining,10,70,A financial data mining model for extracting customer behavior,2011

"This article develops a more comprehensive understanding of data mining by examining the application of this technology in the marketplace. In addition to exploring the technological issues that arise from the use of these applications, we address some of the social concerns that are too often ignored. As more firms shift more of their business activities to the Web, increasingly more information about consumers and potential customers is being captured in Web server logs. Sophisticated analytic and data mining software tools enable firms to use the data contained in these logs to develop and implement a complex relationship management strategy. Although this new trend in marketing strategy is based on the old idea of relating to customers as individuals, customer relationship management actually rests on segmenting consumers into groups based on profiles developed through a firm's data mining activities. Individuals whose profiles suggest that they are likely to provide a high lifetime value to the firm are served content that will vary from that which is served to consumers with less attractive profiles. Social costs may be imposed on society when objectively rational business decisions involving data mining and consumer profiles are made. The ensuing discussion examines the ways in which data mining and the use of consumer profiles may exclude classes of consumers from full participation in the marketplace, and may limit their access to information essential to their full participation as citizens in the public sphere.

"In e-commerce, online product reviews significantly influence the purchase decisions of buyers and the marketing strategies employed by vendors. However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results; (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers; and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Zheng X.; Zhu S.; Lin Z.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2013.06.002,Online review; Review mining; Review quality; Semi-supervised learning; Social network,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses a semi-supervised system for classifying online product reviews, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Product recommendation is a business activity that is critical in attracting customers. Accordingly, improving the quality of a recommendation to fulfill customers' needs is important in fiercely competitive environments. Although various recommender systems have been proposed, few have addressed the lifetime value of a customer to a firm. Generally, customer lifetime value (CLV) is evaluated in terms of recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) variables. However, the relative importance among them varies with the characteristics of the product and industry. We developed a novel product recommendation methodology that combined group decision-making and data mining techniques. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to determine the relative weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. Clustering techniques were then employed to group customers according to the weighted RFM value. Finally, an association rule mining approach was implemented to provide product recommendations to each customer group. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach outperformed one with equally weighted RFM and a typical collaborative filtering (CF) method. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"The development of the network economy has transformed business practices. A major shift occurs in the marketing efforts. Given the abundant information on customers and products, marketing responsibility has changed from managing products for sellers to managing relationships with customers, and to facilitating decision-making for customers. These marketing efforts are essentially an intermediary of two-way communication between businesses and customers, and they would require data analysis techniques. Particularly through data mining, which comprises techniques for the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, organisations are able to identify valuable customers, predict future behaviours, and allow firms to make proactive, knowledge driven decisions. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each method having its advantages and disadvantages for different types of marketing purposes. This paper examines the issue of applying different techniques to meet the marketing requirements in the network economy.

Data aggregation is a common operation in business, science, engineering, medicine, etc.; it is performed for purposes such as statistical, financial, and sales and marketing analysis - particularly within the context of a data warehouse. We showed experimentally that, for this example, as long as aggregation does not shrink the sample size unduly, it does not significantly impair the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting the direction of the DJIA stock market index. We also observed that aggregation-based models are simpler (less over-parameterized) than detail-based models.

"Business marketers widely use data mining for segmenting and targeting markets. To assess data mining for use by political marketers, we mined the 1948 to 2004 American National Elections Studies data file to identify a small number of variables and rules that can be used to predict individual voting behavior, including abstention, with the intent of segmenting the electorate in useful and meaningful ways. The resulting decision tree correctly predicts vote choice with 66 percent accuracy, a success rate that compares favorably with other predictive methods. More importantly, the process provides rules that identify segments of voters based on their predicted vote choice, with the vote choice of some segments predictable with up to 87 percent success.

"As the higher education (HE) sector has expanded, so has the variety of courses on offer, with applicants now choosing between greater numbers of potential options. Where applications to HE are administered through centralised admission services, applicants will often make multiple initial course choices, which offers an opportunity to examine systematic groupings of interest within course choice sets, and assess whether certain types of student are more likely to make concentrated or diffuse subject selections. Utilising a national database of an entire cohort's application behaviour, the empirical findings presented in this article indicate that there are clusters of subjects that are applied for in combination, and that certain ethnic minority, socio-economic groups and neighbourhood types are more likely to make more diffuse subject choices.

"In today's digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset, and the implementation of knowledge management supports a company in developing innovative products and making critical management strategic decisions. Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely researched. To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer knowledge management for innovative product development. In the knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract customer knowledge from different market segments. An empirical study applying the E-CKM model has been carried out, and it meets the evaluation criteria in a multiple-assessment scheme for showing a satisfactory result.

"As the first phase of quality function deployment (QFD) and the only interface between the customers and product development team, house of quality (HOQ) plays the most important role in developing quality products that are able to satisfy customer needs. No matter in what shape or form HOQ can be built, the key to this process is to find out the hidden relationship between customers' requirements and product design specifications. This paper presents a general rough set based data mining approach for HOQ analysis. It utilises the historical information of customer needs and the design specifications of the product that was purchased, employs the basic rough set notions to reveal the interrelationships between customer needs and design specifications automatically. Due to the data reduction nature of the approach, a minimal set of customer needs that are crucial for the decision on the correlated design specifications is derived. The end result of the approach is in the form of a minimal rule set, which not only fulfils the goal of HOQ, but can be used as supporting data for marketing purposes.

"Dividend is the return that an investor receives when purchasing a company's shares. The decision to pay these dividends to shareholders concerns several other groups of people, such as financial managers, consulting firms, individual and institutional investors, government and monitoring authorities, and creditors, just to name a few. The prediction and modelling of this decision has received a significant amount of attention in the corporate finance literature. However, the methods used to study the aforementioned question are limited to the logistic regression method without any implementation of the advanced and expert methods of data mining. These methods have proven their superiority in other business-related fields, such as marketing, production, accounting and auditing. In finance, bankruptcy prediction has the vast majority among data-mining implementations, but to the best of the authors’ knowledge such an implementation does not exist in dividend payment prediction. This paper satisfies this gap in the literature and provides answers that help to understand the so-called ‘dividend puzzle’. Specifically, this paper provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that data-mining methods perform better in accuracy measures against the traditional methods used.

"Data mining techniques provide people with new power to research and manipulate the existing large volume of data. A data mining process discovers interesting information from the hidden data that can either be used for future prediction and/or intelligently summarising the details of the data. There are many achievements of applying data mining techniques to various areas such as marketing, medical, decision support, flaw detection, business management and financial, although few of them can be currently seen in virtual reality domain. In this paper, a proposed data mining application in virtual reality is explained and experimented. The empirical results demonstrate the capability of data mining techniques in virtual reality and the potential benefits in applying data mining to this area.

"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the concepts of business intelligence (BI), knowledge management (KM) and analytical CRM (aCRM) and to establish a framework for integrating all the three to each other. The paper also seeks to establish a KM and aCRM based framework using data mining (DM) techniques, which helps in the enterprise decision-making. The objective is to share how KM and aCRM can be integrated into this seamless analytics framework to sustain excellence in decision making using effective data mining techniques and to explore how working on such aCRM system can be effective for enabling organizations delivering complete solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on focused and dedicated study of the literature present on the aCRM, KM and data mining techniques. The paper considered how to develop a strategy and operational framework that would build aCRM on the foundation of existing DM techniques and KM approach to meet the business challenges. Based on this research, a customized, integrated framework, to match the needs of business was designed. Findings: KM focuses on managing knowledge within the organization and aCRM focuses on gaining analytical information from the customer data. Both KM and aCRM help in the decision making process and understanding. This knowledge is difficult to uncover. Hence, this paper explains the importance of data mining tools and techniques to uncover knowledge by the integration between KM and aCRM. This paper presents an integrated KM and aCRM based framework using DM techniques. Research limitations/implications: All the firms may not be in favor of adopting KM while implementing aCRM. The KM requires a convalesce of organizational culture, technology innovations, effective work force in culminating knowledge dissemination in all business domains. Practical implications: The organizations implementing this knowledge enabled aCRM framework would be easily able to convert their business knowledge via the analytical CRM to solve many business issues, such as increase response rates from direct mail, telephone, e-mail, and internet delivered marketing campaigns, increased sales and increased services. With aCRM, firms can identify their most profitable customers and use this knowledge for promotional schemes for those customers as well as identify future customers with prediction on ROI. Originality/value: The need for the integration of KM and aCRM is clear. It is written for practitioners who are looking for approaches to improve business performance and maintain high profits for their business by incorporating knowledge-enabled aCRM in their setup. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Ranjan J.; Bhatnagar V.,Strategic,10.1108/09696471111103731,Business analysis; Customer relations; Data mining; Knowledge management,5.0,,10,0,,"The paper discusses the integration of knowledge management and analytical CRM frameworks aimed at improving long-term decision-making processes within organizations.

"Despite the popular use of social media by consumers and marketers, empirical research investigating their economic values still lags. In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice. © 2013 INFORMS.",Goh K.-Y.; Heng C.-S.; Lin Z.,Tactical,10.1287/isre.1120.0469,Brand community; Communication mode; Conometric modeling; Consumer behavior; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The study focuses on quantifying the impact of user-generated and marketer-generated content on consumer purchasing behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, such as user engagement in social media and marketing analytics.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Social media brand community and consumer behavior: Quantifying the relative impact of user- and marketer-generated content,2013
"Previous studies on mining association rules focus on discovering associations among items without considering the relationships between items and their purchased quantities. However, exploring associations among items associated with their purchased quantities may discover information useful to improve the quality of business decisions. In this paper, we investigate the issue of mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions. When purchased quantities are considered, the supports of items associated with their purchased quantities may decrease drastically, and the number of potentially interesting association rules discovered will be few. In order to discover more potentially interesting rules, we present two partition algorithms to partition all the possible quantities into intervals for each item. We also propose an efficient mechanism to discover all the large itemsets from the partitioned data. Experimental results show that by our approach, the total execution time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, the potentially interesting rule discovered from the partitioned data can be considered to be a kind of generalized association rule. The generalized association rule is useful in marketing, business management and decision making, especially when the information from the rules generated from the original data is limited.",Tsai P.S.M.; Chen C.-M.,Tactical,,Data mining; Large q_itemset generation; Partition scheme; Performance study; Quantitative association rule,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the mining of quantitative association rules from sales transaction data to improve business decision-making, which aligns with tactical goals such as marketing analytics and sales promotion.",scopus-data mining,10,70,Mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions,2001
"Much has been written about word of mouth and customer behavior. Telephone call detail records provide a novel way to understand the strength of the relationship between individuals. In this paper, we predict using call detail records the impact that the behavior of one customer has on another customer's decisions. We study this in the context of churn (a decision to leave a communication service provider) and cross-buying decisions based on an anonymized data set from a telecommunications provider. Call detail records are represented as a weighted graph and a novel statistical learning technique, Markov logic networks, is used in conjunction with logit models based on lagged neighborhood variables to develop the predictive model. In addition, we propose an approach to propositionalization tailored to predictive modeling with social network data. The results show that information on the churn of network neighbors has a significant positive impact on the predictive accuracy and in particular the sensitivity of churn models. The results provide evidence that word of mouth has a considerable impact on customers' churn decisions and also on the purchase decisions, leading to a 19.5% and 8.4% increase in sensitivity of predictive models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Business students taking business analytics courses that have significant predictive modeling components, such as marketing research, data mining, forecasting, and advanced financial modeling, are introduced to nonlinear regression using application software that is a ""black box"" to the students. Thus, although correct models are estimated, students often do not obtain a thorough understanding of the nonlinear estimation process. The exercise presented in this article was created to demonstrate to students the need for nonlinear regression estimation-rather than using linear transformations and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and subsequently demonstrate the nonlinear optimization process to estimate nonlinear regression models. Using the spreadsheet exercise, students can see effects on the fit of the model by changing the model parameters as they change the values of the decision variables. After applying the spreadsheet to further exercises, students have expressed a deep understanding of the linear regression software. This exercise is innovative because the active learning exercise requires the students to make the logical connections between the structure of the model, the model's parameters, and the objective function. © 2013 The Author Decision Sciences © 2013 Decision Sciences Institute.",Pinder J.P.,Tactical,10.1111/dsji.12009,Analytics; And Regression; Nonlinear; Optimization,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract describes an educational exercise aimed at improving business students' understanding of nonlinear regression and its applications in predictive modeling, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and programmatic sampling.",scopus-data mining,10,70,An excel solver exercise to introduce nonlinear regression,2013
"In response to the thriving development in electronic commerce (EC), many on-line retailers have developed Web-based information systems to handle enormous amounts of transactions on the Internet. These systems can automatically capture data on the browsing histories and purchasing records of individual customers. This capability has motivated the development of data-mining applications. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a useful data-mining method to discover customers' purchasing patterns over time. We incorporate the recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) concept presented in the marketing literature to define the RFM sequential pattern and develop a novel algorithm for generating all RFM sequential patterns from customers' purchasing data. Using the algorithm, we propose a pattern segmentation framework to generate valuable information on customer purchasing behavior for managerial decision-making. Extensive experiments are carried out, using synthetic datasets and a transactional dataset collected by a retail chain in Taiwan, to evaluate the proposed algorithm and empirically demonstrate the benefits of using RFM sequential patterns in analyzing customers' purchasing data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"In the era of Web 2.0, with the social media's advantage, many creative e-commerce modes based on online or offline social networks emerged, such as social buying and viral marketing. Social network analysis provides a powerful set of tools for modelling social networks to understand their structure and behaviour. However, current challenge is that the target environments involve large amounts of relational data that characterise multi-entities, time-sensitive, decision-making situations. To understand the structure and the dynamic mechanisms of the complex real-world system, the researchers need innovative network modelling approaches and analysis techniques. This paper first proposes a social buying metanetwork model, and then provides a methodology framework integrated business intelligence techniques with dynamic network analysis tools, finally the case study describes the process on metanetwork modelling, dynamic network analysis, and buyer behaviour pattern mining.

"A study of the online browsing and purchasing habits of some 1,400 outbound travelers in Hong Kong demonstrates the analytical power of weight-of-evidence (WOE) data mining. The WOE approach allows analysts to identify and transform the variables with the most predictive power regarding the likelihood of tourists' online preferences and decisions. The study found that just over one-third of the respondents browsed hotel-related websites, and about half of those browsers had booked a room on those sites. Browsers in Hong Kong tended to be young, well educated, and well traveled. Those who used the hotel websites for purchases were, of course, part of the browser group, and were likewise relatively well educated. However, one unexpected variable set off those who used the websites for a hotel purchase, the length of their most recent trip. One possible reason is that long-haul tourists want to be sure of their accommodations, or this may reflect hotels' free-night offers.

"Purpose - The cost of retaining a customer is lower than that of obtaining a new one, so potential customer defection is an important issue in the fiercely competitive environment of electronic commerce. Accordingly, this paper aims to present a new way for gauging customer loyalty and predicting their possibility of defection reference to a set of quality attributes satisfaction and three types of belief in the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/ approach - The performance of the classification utilization artificial neural networks (ANNs) was compared to that of traditional analytic tools, such as multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and classificatory data mining technique - decision tree. Findings - The analytical result represented that the predicted accuracy of ANNs is better then MDA and decision tree in both training and testing phases.

"Given the trend that international corporations are utilizing various information systems for their daily activities, information on sales transactions together with corresponding customer profile is usually available in airlines and international hotel chains. This allows segments of customers to be drawn according to selected relevant demographic variables. This is referred to as Database Marketing, a new trend in marketing that makes use of information available in a company's database. The extracted information is also useful in planning marketing strategies, launching new products/services and defining market segmentation.As databases in large corporations nowadays are getting large, sparser, more free-formatted and more dynamic, traditional statistical techniques may not be capable of extracting the encapsulated knowledge inside the databases. A new technical stream, data mining has been developed in Computer Science to deal with the complex task of extracting and managing any potential knowledge embedded inside databases.

"Decision making in marketing becomes more and more sophisticated and two important issues in marketing decisions are market segmentation and segment evaluation and selection. These decisions are two focal points of all companies which many strategies are followed or influenced by them. Decision making is based on information and data mining aims to extract useful information form implicit, unknown and raw data. Clustering techniques are one of the widely used data mining tools which have been used for dividing market into different segments. In recent years, numerous papers about using data mining or multi attribute decision making (MADM) for marketing decisions have been published. MADM tools are used as a natural approach for evaluating alternatives with respect to conflict criterion. Thus, this study aims to integrate these two fields for improving quality of market segmentation's decisions. The proposed methodology is a combination of data mining tools for market segmentation and MA DM tools for evaluation and selection of the best market. More precisely, clustering is used to divide a whole market into different segments. Two MA DM tools including, step-wise weight assessment ratio Analysis (SIVARA) and complex proportional assessment of alternatives with grey relations (COPRAS-G), were applied for market segment evaluation and selection. The most desirable features influencing the choice of a market segment evaluation and selection are identified based on literature study. Grey relation analysis allows incorporating the vague and imprecise information in to the decision model. A real-world data on a laptop market is put forward to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology.

"More and more consumers are relying on online opinions when making purchasing decisions. For this reason, companies must have knowledge of the actual standing of their products on the Web. A warning system for online market research is being proposed which allows the identification of critical situations in online opinion formation. When critical situations are detected, warnings are subsequently sent to marketing managers and thus allowing marketers the ability to initiate preventive measures. The warning system operates on a knowledge base which contains product-related success values, online opinions and patterns of social interactions. This knowledge is acquired using methods coming from information extraction, text mining and social network analysis. Based on this knowledge the warning system judges situations accordingly. For this purpose, a neuro-fuzzy approach is chosen which learns linguistic rules from data. These rules are employed to estimate future situations. The warning system is applied to two scenarios and yields good results. An evaluation shows that all components of the warning system outperform alternative methods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Estimating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is essential for firms competing in data-rich environments. Segmentation on the basis of CLV is helpful in customization of products and services by justification of resource allocation. Model-based automated decision making is likely to penetrate various marketing decision-making environments. We are presenting a framework for customer lifetime value-based segmentation. The framework automates two decisions: first, selection of variables; and second creation of optimal segments on the basis of CLV. The framework uses clustering for segmentation and genetic algorithm for optimization.© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",Aeron H.; Kumar A.; Moorthy J.,Tactical,10.1057/dbm.2012.1,customer lifetime value; database marketing; genetic algorithm; lustering; Recency-Frequency-Monetary Value (RFM); segmentation,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses a framework for customer lifetime value-based segmentation, which automates decisions related to variable selection and segment creation.

"The study of consumer behavior in the refurbishment industry is crucial to the business operation of firms, but there is a lack of research in this regard. With reference to the EKB model specific to consumer behavior, this paper discusses the relationship among consumption characteristics, firm selection behavior and satisfaction degree of refurbishment customers. 242 valid questionnaire copies were collected from refurbishment customers, and analyzed using Decision Tree Analysis and Association Rules in Data Mining. The research results show that, over half of the customers tend to entrust the refurbishment to well-reputed firms. Moreover, the integrity of refurbishment equipment, response of refurbishment personnel, professionalism and confidence are key elements in service quality (SQ). The best marketing policy for the customers is one which provides more attractive services. These research findings may provide a useful reference for innovative refurbishment firms in their decision-making.",Huang C.-F.; Hsueh S.-L.,Tactical,10.3846/jcem.2010.07,Business strategy; Consumer behavior; Datamining; EKB model; Refurbishment industry; Service quality,5.0,,20,0,,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior in the refurbishment industry and provides insights into the factors influencing firm selection and service quality.

"We studied the problem of optimizing the performance of a DSS for churn prediction. In particular, we investigated the beneficial effect of adding the voice of customers through call center emails - i.e. textual information - to a churn-prediction system that only uses traditional marketing information. We found that adding unstructured, textual information into a conventional churn-prediction model resulted in a significant increase in predictive performance. From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to better identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose: This paper aims to provide an example of how to use data mining techniques to identify patient segments regarding preferences for healthcare attributes and their demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Data were derived from a number of individuals who received in-patient care at a health network in 2006. Data mining and conventional hierarchical clustering with average linkage and Pearson correlation procedures are employed and compared to show how each procedure best determines segmentation variables. Findings: Data mining tools identified three differentiable segments by means of cluster analysis. These three clusters have significantly different demographic profiles. Practical implications: The study reveals, when compared with traditional statistical methods, that data mining provides an efficient and effective tool for market segmentation. When there are numerous cluster variables involved, researchers and practitioners need to incorporate factor analysis for reducing variables to clearly and meaningfully understand clusters. Originality/value: Interests and applications in data mining are increasing in many businesses. However, this technology is seldom applied to healthcare customer experience management. The paper shows that efficient and effective application of data mining methods can aid the understanding of patient healthcare preferences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Liu S.S.; Chen J.,Out of scope,10.1108/09526860910944610,Data analysis; Market segmentation; Patients; United States of America,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract focuses on healthcare data mining techniques applied to patient segmentation, which is not related to marketing applications as defined in the classification criteria.",scopus-data mining,0,0,Using data mining to segment healthcare markets from patients' preference perspectives,2009
"Many small online retailers and new entrants to the online retail sector are keen to practice data mining and consumer-centric marketing in their businesses yet technically lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to do so. In this article a case study of using data mining techniques in customer-centric business intelligence for an online retailer is presented. The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively. On the basis of the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, customers of the business have been segmented into various meaningful groups using the k-means clustering algorithm and decision tree induction, and the main characteristics of the consumers in each segment have been clearly identified. Accordingly a set of recommendations is further provided to the business on consumer-centric marketing.
