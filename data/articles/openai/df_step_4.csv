Social media as a strategic tool: Going beyond the obvious,Arora P.; Predmore C.E.,2013,10.1108/S1877-6361(2013)0000011010,"Purpose - This chapter demonstrates the strategic use of social media by firms interacting with stakeholders, not just customers. Corporations have seen how consumers can share their experiences with products and services. Smart companies find ways to leverage these conversations to engage current and potential customers and other stakeholders. Design/methodological approach - Our approach is theoretical, based on an examination of how the communication channel of social media can be used as a strategic tool throughout the organization, going well beyond marketing. Findings - This chapter looks at four advantages of social media. Social media provides a mechanism for firms to not just find customers, but also allow customers to find firms. Social media can engage customers, industry influencers, and thought pundits in cost-effective ways that benefit both the firm and stakeholders. The largest contribution of social media is the information from big data on customer needs and wants as well as on the processes underlying consumer decisions. The greatest opportunity lies in how a firm converts data into actionable intelligence in real time. Practical applications - We discuss how the words, social and media, need to be de-coupled: The concept of social can be practically applied very effectively to areas of strategy and internal learning, and product development. Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by social media requires a social enterprise to be effective. Originality - This chapter presents an original theoretical framework of social media that can be used by a company to examine the social aspects and implications of every element in the value chain.

Dynamic cooperation strategies of the closed-loop supply chain involving the internet service platform,Xiang Z.; Xu M.,2019,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.310,"In the age of “Internet+” many Internet service platforms (ISPs) in China have been widely introduced to the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To further study the role of the Internet service platform, this paper considers a CLSC composed of a manufacturer, a retailer and an Internet service platform who invests in research and development (R&D), advertising and Big Data marketing, and develops the goodwill dynamic model based on the differential game theory. The construction of a goodwill dynamic model has two purposes, namely, to increase sales and the return rate. The optimal decisions for 3 players under two different cooperative scenarios are obtained, namely, the retailer payment scenario (scenario D) and the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario (scenario S). The supply chain members gain more profit or achieve a higher level of goodwill for products under certain conditions, i.e., a high residual value from remanufacturing, a high sharing rate of residual value from the retailer's recycled products, and a low recycling cost. Interestingly, the wholesale price increases with the residual value of recycled products when goodwill effectiveness is low, while the price declines when goodwill effectiveness is high. After comparing two cooperative scenarios, the result shows that an Internet service platform will invest more in Big Data marketing under the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario, and cooperation between the manufacturer and the Internet service platform can help improve the goodwill of enterprises or products. Moreover, the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario is payoff-Pareto-improving in most cases through the coordination of a cost-sharing rate, and the effectiveness of Big Data marketing exerts a positive effect on goodwill and the development of the industry. In addition, the retailer has “free rider” tendencies in the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario. The results encourage more enterprises to enhance the value of goodwill through cooperation with Internet service platforms because Internet service platforms conveniently utilize Big Data marketing to increase the sales of products and the collecting rate of used products, which in turn helps environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Big data marketing; Closed-loop supply chain; Differential game; Internet service platform,Elsevier Ltd,scopus-big data,Strategic,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of integrating Internet service platforms into closed-loop supply chains, focusing on cooperation, goodwill enhancement, and R&D investment, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals.",60,25,10,0,5
Do conversational platforms represent the next big digital marketing opportunity?,Copulsky J.,2019,,"This paper examines the evolution of conversational platforms.

Perspectives on big data,Weinberg B.D.; Davis L.; Berger P.D.,2013,10.1057/jma.2013.20,"There is much hype associated with the term ‘Big Data’ (BD), and much opportunity in the data that are associated with that term, along with the tools and techniques in existence and being developed to leverage it for decision making and improving the condition of living beings, firms and society. However, many are not clear on what are, or what is meant by the term, ‘Big Data’. The focus of this research was to explore the meaning of BD and to identify important paths of research on BD. As part of this process, we called upon a diverse set of marketing scholars who possess expertise and special insights. We discovered that different communities have different perspectives. It could be argued that they are all correct as they reflect the preferred perspectives of different communities. We find it helpful to think of BD as a term that represents a period of time or era, a process, and data that are from a variety of sources, of various structures or forms, and in a variety of locations.

From academic research to marketing practice: Exploring the marketing science value chain,Roberts J.H.; Kayande U.; Stremersch S.,2014,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2013.07.006,"We aim to investigate the impact of marketing science articles and tools on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners' tools, which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term ""marketing science value chain"" to describe these diffusion steps, and survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value chain.In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to 2003 that achieved dual - academic and practice - impact are Guadagni and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice. Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual impact marketing science papers.

When ‘significant’ is not significant,Kennedy R.; Scriven J.; Nenycz-Thiel M.,2014,10.2501/ijmr-2014-041,"Big data is here for some and coming for many. It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies.

Big data-driven framework for viral churn prevention: A case study,Lucantoni L.; Antomarioni S.; Bevilacqua M.; Ciarapica F.E.,2020,10.24425/mper.2020.134930,"The application of churn prevention represents an important step for mobile communication companies aiming at increasing customer loyalty. In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk.

Abuse of Dominance in Non-Negotiable Privacy Policy in the Digital Market,Wahyuningtyas S.Y.,2017,10.1007/s40804-017-0084-0,"Personal data and its use have become the front-line of businesses in the digital market. With the potential to be extracted for information, making this available for various purposes, big data transforms into a powerful tool for data controllers for effective marketing, defining strategic business decisions, and establishing a strong foothold in the market. The use of personal data for targeted marketing exemplifies this. While privacy has been subject to the regime of privacy protection, privacy violation might entangle competition law analysis when it involves abuse of market dominance. This paper addresses these problems by discussing three key issues: first, how competition law addresses the use of personal data as the new frontier of innovation and competition; second, whether big data plays a role to qualify dominance; and third, if non-negotiable policy on privacy infringes the prohibition of dominance abuse under competition law. © 2017, T.M.C.

Managing marketing decision-making with sentiment analysis: An evaluation of the main product features using text data mining,Kauffmann E.; Peral J.; Gil D.; Ferrández A.; Sellers R.; Mora H.,2019,10.3390/su11154235,"Companies have realized the importance of ""big data"" in creating a sustainable competitive advantage, and user-generated content (UGC) represents one of big data's most important sources. From blogs to social media and online reviews, consumers generate a huge amount of brand-related information that has a decisive potential business value for marketing purposes. Particularly, we focus on online reviews that could have an influence on brand image and positioning. Within this context, and using the usual quantitative star score ratings, a recent stream of research has employed sentiment analysis (SA) tools to examine the textual content of reviews and categorize buyer opinions. Although many SA tools split comments into negative or positive, a review can contain phrases with different polarities because the user can have different sentiments about each feature of the product. Finding the polarity of each feature can be interesting for product managers and brand management. In this paper, we present a general framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, text data mining, and clustering techniques, to obtain new scores based on consumer sentiments for different product features. The main contribution of our proposal is the combination of price and the aforementioned scores to define a new global score for the product, which allows us to obtain a ranking according to product features. Furthermore, the products can be classified according to their positive, neutral, or negative features (visualized on dashboards), helping consumers with their sustainable purchasing behavior. We proved the validity of our approach in a case study using big data extracted from Amazon online reviews (specifically cell phones), obtaining satisfactory and promising results. After the experimentation, we could conclude that our work is able to improve recommender systems by using positive, neutral, and negative customer opinions and by classifying customers based on their comments. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Feature selection; Marketing decisions; Sentiment analysis,MDPI,scopus-big data,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the use of sentiment analysis and natural language processing to improve marketing practices, particularly in analyzing online reviews for better product recommendations and consumer insights.

Management overconfidence and CSR activities in Korea with a big data approach,Kang S.-A.; Cho S.-M.,2020,10.3390/su12114406,"We examined the relationship between management characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) and this relationship was differentiated by the level of corporate governance. Our analysis was undertaken in firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE) from 2006 to 2015. We employed Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression after clustering the standard errors at the firm level in order to examine these relationships. The KEJI (Korea Economic Justice Institute) index was used as a proxy for CSR and a big data-based proxy estimated from multimedia was used as the level of advertising. We showed that there is a positive relationship between overconfident management and CSR activities. We then categorized the CSR activities as primary and social activities and found that overconfident management is more aggressive in primary CSR activities. In addition, overconfident management makes fewer CSR expenditures when the management is in a chaebol firm but promotes more CSR advertisement. This finding indicates that chaebol affiliation controls overinvestment in CSR activities but promotes CSR advertisements by overconfident managers. Similarly, we found consistent results with overconfident ownermanagers. Prior literature on CSR activities focuses on the impact of CSR activities on firm performance.

Reducing inferior member community participation using uplift modeling: Evidence from a field experiment,Debaere S.; Devriendt F.; Brunneder J.; Verbeke W.; De Ruyck T.; Coussement K.,2019,10.1016/j.dss.2019.113077,"In their ongoing search for competitive advantage, firms increasingly leverage online innovation communities (ICs). The viability of these ICs may be jeopardized by big data environments and inferior member participation. Therefore, community managers must address poor member participation, together with the data-rich environment. This study examines the viability of a proactive motivational email campaign to reduce inferior member participation using uplift modeling; it also explores optimal treatment characteristics, including message scope (untargeted versus targeted), message content (hedonic, cognitive, and social message), and member profile (self-interest–oriented and positive emotional writing style). The findings indicate that marketing decision makers should use proactive, targeted emails with cognitive motivational elements to mitigate inferior levels of member participation.

A new latent class model for analysis of purchasing and browsing histories on EC sites,Goto M.; Mikawa K.; Hirasawa S.; Kobayashi M.; Suko T.; Horii S.,2015,10.7232/iems.2015.14.4.335,"The electronic commerce site (EC site) has become an important marketing channel where consumers can purchase many kinds of products; their access logs, including purchase records and browsing histories, are saved in the EC sites' databases. These log data can be utilized for the purpose of web marketing. The customers who purchase many product items are good customers, whereas the other customers, who do not purchase many items, must not be good customers even if they browse many items. If the attributes of good customers and those of other customers are clarified, such information is valuable as input for making a new marketing strategy. Regarding the product items, the characteristics of good items that are bought by many users are valuable information. It is necessary to construct a method to efficiently analyze such characteristics. This paper proposes a new latent class model to analyze both purchasing and browsing histories to make latent item and user clusters. By applying the proposal, an example of data analysis on an EC site is demonstrated.

The value of field experiments,Li J.Q.; Rusmevichientong P.; Simester D.; Tsitsiklis J.N.; Zoumpoulis S.I.,2015,10.1287/mnsc.2014.2066,"The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: The number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices.

The state of the art and taxonomy of big data analytics: view from new big data framework,Mohamed A.; Najafabadi M.K.; Wah Y.B.; Zaman E.A.K.; Maskat R.,2020,10.1007/s10462-019-09685-9,"Big data has become a significant research area due to the birth of enormous data generated from various sources like social media, internet of things and multimedia applications. Big data has played critical role in many decision makings and forecasting domains such as recommendation systems, business analysis, healthcare, web display advertising, clinicians, transportation, fraud detection and tourism marketing. The rapid development of various big data tools such as Hadoop, Storm, Spark, Flink, Kafka and Pig in research and industrial communities has allowed the huge number of data to be distributed, communicated and processed. Big data applications use big data analytics techniques to efficiently analyze large amounts of data. However, choosing the suitable big data tools based on batch and stream data processing and analytics techniques for development a big data system are difficult due to the challenges in processing and applying big data. Practitioners and researchers who are developing big data systems have inadequate information about the current technology and requirement concerning the big data platform. Hence, the strengths and weaknesses of big data technologies and effective solutions for Big Data challenges are needed to be discussed. Hence, due to that, this paper presents a review of the literature that analyzes the use of big data tools and big data analytics techniques in areas like health and medical care, social networking and internet, government and public sector, natural resource management, economic and business sector.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions.

Technological improvements have greatly increased the ability to gather customer data, which elevates the roles of the CMO and CIO while increasing their dependence on each other. The research on the relationship between senior executives outside of that with the CEO is limited; this paper fills that gap by exploring CMO/CIO cooperation. To analyze the dynamics of the CMO/CIO relationship, this research introduces a conceptual framework that captures three antecedents of cooperation: interdependence, CMO/CIO relationship structure, and CMO/CIO diversity. In cases in which dependence between the two executives is asymmetric, this paper proposes four cooperation mechanisms expected to mediate the relationship between these individual and organizational level antecedents and CMO/CIO cooperation.

This article shows, however, that advertisers and marketers who are taking up ideas and techniques from behavioral economics tell their clients a very different story about the aims and use of digital marketing and consumer surveillance. Listening in on this discourse demonstrates that some digital marketers conceptualize their own practices as forms of social control, appropriating concepts from behavioral economics to identify consumers’ cognitive and affective biases and target their vulnerabilities.

Towards a real-time processing framework based on improved distributed recurrent neural network variants with fastText for social big data analytics,Ait Hammou B.; Ait Lahcen A.; Mouline S.,2020,10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102122,"Big data generated by social media stands for a valuable source of information, which offers an excellent opportunity to mine valuable insights. Particularly, User-generated contents such as reviews, recommendations, and users’ behavior data are useful for supporting several marketing activities of many companies. Knowing what users are saying about the products they bought or the services they used through reviews in social media represents a key factor for making decisions. Sentiment analysis is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Although deep learning for sentiment analysis has achieved great success and allowed several firms to analyze and extract relevant information from their textual data, but as the volume of data grows, a model that runs in a traditional environment cannot be effective, which implies the importance of efficient distributed deep learning models for social Big Data analytics. Besides, it is known that social media analysis is a complex process, which involves a set of complex tasks. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges and issues of social big data analytics and enhance the performance of deep learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy to obtain better decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentiment analysis, which is devoted to adopting fastText with Recurrent neural network variants to represent textual data efficiently. Then, it employs the new representations to perform the classification task. Its main objective is to enhance the performance of well-known Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants in terms of classification accuracy and handle large scale data. In addition, we propose a distributed intelligent system for real-time social big data analytics. It is designed to ingest, store, process, index, and visualize the huge amount of information in real-time. The proposed system adopts distributed machine learning with our proposed method for enhancing decision-making processes. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that our proposal for sentiment analysis outperforms well-known distributed recurrent neural network variants (i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Specifically, we tested the efficiency of our approach using the three different deep learning models. The results show that our proposed approach is able to enhance the performance of the three models. The current work can provide several benefits for researchers and practitioners who want to collect, handle, analyze and visualize several sources of information in real-time. Also, it can contribute to a better understanding of public opinion and user behaviors using our proposed system with the improved variants of the most powerful distributed deep learning and machine learning algorithms.

The Internet has influenced communication and boosted new technologies, which have advanced dramatically in the first three decades of the twenty-first century. This has had an impact on the various economic activities, among which tourism is particularly salient. Consequently, consumers no longer have a receptive role. They have become decision makers with respect to the media material that they consume in addition to having the opportunity of being information providers. Mexico City (CDMX), as a tourism segment, is no exception. It depends on the communication of public and private actors, who, while having certain methodologies and tools to access their audiences, interact with an audience that decides on what it receives and gives its opinion on the web. Therefore, the objective of the research is to assess the associated concepts, pages and organizations related to tourism in CDMX on the website aimed at both a domestic and international audience, designed by the government and private sector together with the input of the audience as an information provider.

Segmenting consumers based on willingness to share data for marketing purposes,Block M.P.; Schultz D.E.,2020,,"Despite new privacy rules and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data and Protection Regulation and the pending California Consumer Protection Act, not all consumers feel the need for data protection. Recent research has shown that 20-25 per cent of the US adult population are willing to share their personal data with marketers they ‘trust’. The marketing challenge thus becomes how to identify these willing ‘data sharers’. Using a widely available data set, this study illustrates several ‘Big Data-based’ segmentation methodologies to screen this important segment out of the general population, ranging from factor analysis to chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) decision trees. The results of these analyses identify some unexpected potential segments among these ‘data sharer’ groups, most notably young men who participate in team sports. Thus, the paper argues that rather than looking at privacy regulation as a burden, marketers might well consider it a key element in their toolbox. © 2020, Henry Stewart Publications.

Bridging customer knowledge to innovative product development: a data mining approach,Zhan Y.; Tan K.H.; Huo B.,2019,10.1080/00207543.2019.1566662,"In the big data era, firms are inundated with customer data, which are valuable in improving services, developing new products, and identifying new markets. However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages.

These changes are emerging from transformations in management skills, technological innovations, and continuously evolving customer behavior. But perhaps the most substantial driver of these changes is the emergence of big data and the analytical methods used to examine and understand the data. To continue being relevant, marketing research must remain as dynamic as the markets themselves and adapt accordingly to the following: Data will continue increasing exponentially; data quality will improve; analytics will be more powerful, easier to use, and more widely used; management and customer decisions will increasingly be knowledge-based; privacy issues and challenges will be both a problem and an opportunity as organizations develop their analytics skills; data analytics will become firmly established as a competitive advantage, both in the marketing research industry and in academics; and for the foreseeable future, the demand for highly trained data scientists will exceed the supply. © 2018 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

Data mining difference in the age of big data: Communication and the social shaping of genome technologies from 1998 to 2007,"Chow-White P.A.; Green S.E., Jr.",2013,,"If the 1990s was all about the information superhighway and the network society, then the first 10 years of the 21st century is perhaps best described as the decade of data. Actors in different enterprises worked feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital data will give objective insight into human relations and provide authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of communication and social shaping of database and data mining technologies in the institutional context of genome science to understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with biological, physical, and big data.

Exploring the optimal granularity for market segmentation in RTB advertising via computational experiment approach,Qin R.; Yuan Y.; Wang F.-Y.,2017,10.1016/j.elerap.2017.07.001,"Real Time Bidding (RTB) is a novel business model of online computational advertising, developing rapidly with the integration of Internet economy and big data analysis. It evolves the business logic of online ad-delivery from buying “ad-impressions” in websites or ad slots to directly buying the best-matched “target audiences”, and thus can help advertisers achieve the precision marketing. As a critical part of RTB advertising markets, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) play a central role in matching advertisers with their target audiences via cookie-based data analysis and market segmentation, and their segmentation strategies (especially the choice of granularity) have key influences in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RTB advertising markets. Based on a mathematical programming approach, this paper studied DSPs’ strategies for market segmentation, and established a selection model of the granularity for segmenting RTB advertising markets. With the computational experiment approach, we designed three experimental scenarios to validate our proposed model, and the experimental results show that: 1) market segmentation has the potential of improving the total revenue of all the advertisers; 2) with the increasing refinement of the market segmentation granularity, the total revenue has a tendency of a rise first and followed by a decline; 3) the optimal granularity of market segmentation will be significantly influenced by the number of advertisers on the DSP, but less influenced by the number of ad requests. Our findings show the crucial role of market segmentation on the RTB advertising effect, and indicate that the DSPs should adjust their market segmentation strategies according to their total number of advertisers. Our findings also highlight the importance of advertisers as well as the characteristics of the target audiences to DSPs’ market segmentation decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Computational experiment; Demand Side Platforms; Market segmentation; Real Time Bidding,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-big data,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the strategies of Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) in market segmentation, focusing on how these strategies can influence the effectiveness and efficiency of Real Time Bidding (RTB) advertising.

A multi-level text classifier for feedback analysis using tweets to enhance product performance,Balusamy B.; Murali T.; Thangavelu A.; Venkata Krishna P.,2015,10.1504/IJEMR.2015.073455,"Big Data refers to the collection and storage of the enormous amount of data which is heterogeneous in nature. Data analysis is quite complex due to its enormous volume and its high generation speed. Big Data has many business applications such as in promotion, marketing either financially or by supporting in decision making. One such application is the sentiment analysis that paves the way for the business analysts to know the positive or negative impact over the product based on the tweets by the people. We propose a three-level text classifier with the first level as principal components analysis (PCA) followed by the support vector machine (SVM) and the conditional random fields (CRF) as the second and third level using the tweets collected. This feedback analyser would promote the sales of the product due to its high accuracy in feedback classification.

A sentiment classification on Indian government schemes using pyspark,Sujatha E.; Radha R.,2020,,"With the rapid growth of social media, millions of users share their opinions everyday about different issues such as services, products, persons, politics, events etc. By analysing these social user’s opinions the most valuable data can be obtained which is used for decision making in various domains. Sentiment Analysis in social media plays a vital role in monitoring of public opinion behind certain topics. Actually 92% of marketing professionals thought that social media has intense effect on their business. By doing an accurate sentiment analysis, winning might not be an impossible thing. Success does not depend only in the number of likes, comments or followers. It also depends in how much positive discussions have been held among the users of social media. The objective of this paper is to build a model that performs multi-class classification of Big data with improved accuracy. The proposed model uses a hybrid of Lexicon-based approach and Machine Learning based approach. In this paper, we have performed the sentiment analysis on the three Central Government Schemes namely Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Make-in India. The Apache Spark’s Machine Learning library, MLlib has been used in order to achieve better results in sentiment analysis for the Big Data. The AFINN dictionary was used to label the tweets and bigrams feature set was used. The Hashing TF-IDF method was used to extract the feature vectors from the raw feature set. These vectors were classified by Random Forest classifier to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments of tweets. The result from this model was tested by using the various testing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-score. The higher accuracy of 89.27% was obtained. © 2020, Research Trend.

Electronic word of mouth analysis for new product positioning evaluation,Gregoriades A.; Pampaka M.,2020,10.1016/j.elerap.2020.100986,"People increasingly choose to express themselves online through electronic word of mouth (eWOM), generating large amounts of data, making eWOM a valuable source of information through big data analytics. This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers’ opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers’ preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers’ opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product.

Applying big data to guide firms’ future industrial marketing strategies,Gnizy I.,2020,10.1108/JBIM-06-2019-0318,"Purpose: While big data (BD), a transformative emerging phenomenon on its youth, plays a growing role in organizations in improving marketing decision-making, few academic works examine the mechanism through which BD can be applied to guide future competitive advantage strategies. The purpose of this paper is to examine if BD’s predictive power helps business to business (B2B) firms selecting their intended generic (differentiation, focus, and cost leadership) strategies. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the learning theory, the study proposes the use of BD as a key driver of intended strategies. Based on data from a cross-industry sample of executives, a conceptual model is tested using path and robustness analyses. Findings: The use of BD plays a prominent role in the selection of intended future strategies in industrial markets. Additional tests demonstrate conditions of competitive intensity and strategic flexibility where BD is more and less beneficial. Research limitations/implications: The study furthers the understanding of traditional learning and intelligence use frameworks and of contemporary future strategies drivers.

Does a chatbot’s location influence consumer attitude and intentions?,Roozen I.; Raedts M.; Waetermans G.,2024,10.1504/IJIMA.2024.139294,"Chatbots engage in real-time conversations with customers. Moreover, they can collect data in a digital landscape that is increasingly sensitive to privacy. The objective of this study was to help strategic marketing decision-makers better understand how and where chatbots can be used effectively to gather consumer data. We analyse whether consumers’ privacy concerns influence their adoption. Furthermore, we invest if privacy concerns, and subsequently information disclosure, are significantly influenced by the chatbot’s location. In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer’s website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots. Both relationships are sequentially mediated via higher privacy concerns and less comfort with information disclosure. Companies therefore need to consider where to deploy their chatbots.

Trust and digital privacy: willingness to disclose personal information to banking chatbot services,Lappeman J.; Marlie S.; Johnson T.; Poggenpoel S.,2023,10.1057/s41264-022-00154-z,"This study explored digital privacy concerns in the use of chatbots as a digital banking service. Three dimensions of trust were tested in relation to user self-disclosure in order to better understand the consumer-chatbot experience in banking. The methodology selected for this research study followed a conclusive, pre-experimental, two-group one-shot case study research design which made use of a non-probability snowballing sampling technique. Privacy concerns were found to have a significantly negative relationship with user self-disclosure in both treatment groups. Respondents exposed to their preferred banking brand experienced lower user self-disclosure and brand trust than those exposed to a fictitious banking brand within the South African context. It is recommended that companies using chatbots focus on easing privacy concerns and build foundations of trust. The gains that chatbots have made in the form of increased productivity and quality of customer service rely on relationships with users who need to disclose personal information. Through this study, we concluded that, despite its power to influence decision-making, the power of a brand is not enough for consumers to considerably increase self-disclosure. Rather, a bridge of trust (through education, communication and product development) is needed that encompasses all three elements of trust, which are brand trust, cognitive trust and emotional trust.

We show that these types of chatbot affordances and disaffordances are related to chatbot effectiveness and discomfort with using chatbots, which in turn can affect employees' attitudes toward chatbots. We conducted an empirical study via an online survey and collected data from 228 B2B marketing employees.

Evaluation on Innovation of Emotional Marketing in Network Live Broadcasting Based on New Media Environment,Wang X.; Yin Z.; Omar N.A.B.,2023,10.33168/JSMS.2023.0328,"With the increase of per capita disposable income of residents and the improvement of social and economic development, people's demand for entertainment has surged, and the online live broadcasting industry has ushered in a golden age of vigorous development. Traditional webcast has the shortcomings of poor user experience, low interactivity and low content quality, which makes it difficult to meet the diversified and personalized consumption requirements of the audience. In this context, the live broadcast system based on social media platform has become one of the effective means to solve these problems. The new media online live emotional marketing has a strong transmissibility, which can provide consumers with more rich and interesting ways to obtain information, and can also improve the effect of brand promotion and word of mouth promotion. Based on the theory of multimodal learning, this paper analyzed the characteristics of user behavior among different types of social networking sites, and explored the emotional interaction mode on social networking sites from the visual and voice dimensions, and provided a basis for the formulation of emotional marketing strategies for webcasting and business decision-making.

A video-based automated recommender (VAR) system for garments,Lu S.; Xiao L.; Ding M.,2016,10.1287/mksc.2016.0984,"In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications.

Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance.

Identifying a good business location using prescriptive analytics: Restaurant location recommendation based on spatial data mining,Han S.; Chen L.; Su Z.; Gupta S.; Sivarajah U.,2024,10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.114691,"This study proposes a new prescriptive analytics method that aims to provide decision-makers with a systematic and objective approach to identify suitable locations, considering the spatial distribution of different types of restaurants. The method comprises of two main components: spatial co-location pattern mining and locationGCN, where locationGCN is based on graph convolutional network (GCN). The spatial co-location pattern mining is utilized to capture the spatial correlation of specific restaurant to determine the candidate location selection range. The locationGCN is designed to further screen out final suitable location ranges for the specific restaurant type. A case study using restaurant data from Xiamen Island collected from Dianping.com is conducted. The empirical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 74.88%, precision of 63.59%, and recall of 77.48%.

Multiple attribute behavioral decision-making model of internet consumers based on prospect theory; [基于前景理论的网络消费者多属性行为决策模型],Wen-Ming Z.; Shao-Jie C.; Xu W.; Hua-Qiong C.,2019,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2019.03.015,"Modeling the decision-making process of online consumers in a proper way can provide strategic suggestions on operation management and service marketing for electronic commerce firms. In recent years, many researches have tried to model the consumers’ decision-making process from different perspectives, like considering consumers' behavior patterns, integrating consumption theories, and utilizing different methods or tools. Most of these researches build models based on the Expected Utility Theory which depends on the ""Rational People"" hypothesis. However, online consumers often make some ""bounded rational"" or ""irrational"" decisions in an electronic commerce environment, due to peers’ influence. Therefore, Prospect Theory, which is dependent on the ""Irrational People"" hypothesis, is selected as the theoretical basis in this paper. We replace the traditional expected utility function with Prospect Theory’s value function to build a reasonable behavioral decision-making model. Moreover, an improvement in value function is acquired by the introduction of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number. We provide our approach in detail as follows. First, we construct the behavioral decision-making model based on Prospect Theory. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy number is introduced to express fuzzy decision-making information, which brings about improved value function, improved weight function as well as improved prospect function. We also build a more appropriate behavioral decision-making model. Therefore, we have determined the basic form of the model. Secondly, the whole service process of B2C electronic commerce is divided into six sub-processes by using service blueprinting. Based on these six sub-processes, the multiple attribute decision-making problem is defined through the determination of the multiple attribute structure and the set of alternatives which includes three dominant B2C platforms in China, e.g. Jingdong (jd.com), Yihaodian (yhd.com) and Dangdang (dangdang.com). Hence, the behavioral decision-making model of online consumers based on Prospect Theory has been determined. Thirdly, the behavioral model of decision-making is quantified by means of text mining of the collected eWOMs (Electronic Word-of-Mouth). The details of the process are showed as follows. First, we construct a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for eWOMs, which classifies eWOMs into different service sub-processes. Then the eWOMs in different sub-processes are clustered by the use of Weka, which is a data mining kit. Based on the clustering results, we can define 13 evaluating indicators and their corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the eWOMs into intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers, which determine the parameters of our model according to the results of sentiment analysis. Therefore, the model is quantified. Finally, we take Jingdong, Yihaodian and Dangdang as examples to test the behavioral model of decision-making. Furthermore, the reliability of this behavioral decision-making model is identified by comparison with the model based on the Expected Utility Theory. The results show that: (1) Compared with the models which are based on Expected Utility Theory, the behavioral decision model proposed in this paper performs better to reveal the practical situation. (2) Results of the calculated examples show that Jingdong scores the highest prospect values, followed by Yihaodian and Dangdang. Clustering of eWOMs results in 13 indicators. Jingdong scores the highest prospect values in seven indicators, while Yihaodian scores the highest ones in four indicators. Though Jingdong takes the highest overall score, its score is the lowest one in after-sales stage, giving rise to a narrowed gap in total score. While Yihaodian’s excellent service recovery help itself to rank second.

Identifying emerging hotel preferences using Emerging Pattern Mining technique,Li G.; Law R.; Vu H.Q.; Rong J.; Zhao X.,2015,10.1016/j.tourman.2014.06.015,"Hotel managers continue to find ways to understand traveler preferences, with the aim of improving their strategic planning, marketing, and product development. Traveler preference is unpredictable for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers.

Methods of variable pre-selection for net score modeling,Michel R.; Schnakenburg I.; von Martens T.,2013,10.1108/JRIM-03-2013-0017,"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on different approaches to variable pre-selection for building net score models (also known as uplift modelling or incremental response modelling). The application of these models supports the identification of customers whose response can be traced back to be an effect of the campaign under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: First, a net scoring methodology based on decision trees is presented. Then, derived from research contributions on this subject and analytics performed on real data from the financial sector, different approaches of variable pre-selection are discussed and compared numerically. Findings: Net-χ2 and net information value as well as the rank lift impact correlation for interval variables would be preferred when performing variable pre-selection for net score models. Simulations showed that the results were relatively stable with respect to the number of cross-validation samples.

Deep neural networks for the classification of bank marketing data using data reduction techniques,Krishna C.L.; Reddy P.V.S.,2019,10.35940/ijrte.C5522.098319,"The amount of data belonging to different domains are being stored rapidly in various repositories across the globe. Extracting useful information from the huge volumes of data is always difficult due to the dynamic nature of data being stored. Data Mining is a knowledge discovery process used to extract the hidden information from the data stored in various repositories, termed as warehouses in the form of patterns. One of the popular tasks of data mining is Classification, which deals with the process of distinguishing every instance of a data set into one of the predefined class labels.

The state of lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance,Wu M.; Andreev P.; Benyoucef M.,2024,10.1007/s10799-023-00388-w,"Although lead scoring is an essential component of lead management, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review and a classification framework dedicated to it. Lead scoring is an effective and efficient way of measuring the quality of leads. In addition, as a critical Information Technology tool, a proper lead scoring model acts as an alleviator to weaken the conflicts between sales and marketing functions. Yet, little is known regarding lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. Lead scoring models are commonly categorized into two classes: traditional and predictive. While the former primarily relies on the experience and knowledge of salespeople and marketers, the latter utilizes data mining models and machine learning algorithms to support the scoring process. This study aims to review and analyze the existing literature on lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine lead scoring models. A total of 44 studies have met the criteria and were included for analysis. Fourteen metrics were identified to measure the impact of lead scoring models on sales performance. With the increased use of data mining and machine learning techniques in the fourth industrial revolution, predictive lead scoring models are expected to replace traditional lead scoring models as they positively impact sales performance. Despite the relative cost of implementing and maintaining predictive lead scoring models, it is still beneficial to supersede traditional lead scoring models, given the higher effectiveness and efficiency of predictive lead scoring models. This study reveals that classification is the most popular data mining model, while decision tree and logistic regression are the most applied algorithms among all the predictive lead scoring models. This study contributes by systematizing and recommending which machine learning method (i.e., supervised and/or unsupervised) shall be used to build predictive lead scoring models based on the integrity of different types of data sources.

Mining longitudinal user sessions with deep learning to extend the boundary of consumer priming,Cheng L.-C.; Chen K.,2022,10.1016/j.dss.2022.113864,"Priming is challenging when consumers start shortlisting products before the final purchase. This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques.

Practical differentially private online advertising,Sun J.; Zhao L.; Liu Z.; Li Q.; Deng X.; Wang Q.; Jiang Y.,2022,10.1016/j.cose.2021.102504,"Powered by machine learning technology, online advertising achieves accurate advertisement delivery to potential customers according to online user profiles. However, it raises serious privacy concerns since the learning process may reveal sensitive information in the profiles.
